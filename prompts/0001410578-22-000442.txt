Item 1. Business
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the content otherwise dictates, "NexGel", the "Company", "we" or "our" mean NexGel, Inc. NexGel was previously known as AquaMed Technologies, Inc. (“AquaMed”) before changing its name to NexGel, Inc. on November 14, 2019.
Our Company
We were incorporated in Delaware on January 13, 2009. We manufacture high water content, electron beam cross-linked, aqueous polymer hydrogels, or gels, used for wound care, medical diagnostics, transdermal drug delivery and cosmetics. We specialize in custom gels by capitalizing on proprietary manufacturing technologies. We have historically served as a contract manufacturer, supplying our gels to third parties who incorporate them into their own products and have recently began producing our own consumer products using our gels focused on proprietary branded products and white label opportunities. Both our gels and our consumer products are manufactured using proprietary and non-proprietary mixing, coating and cross-linking technologies. Together, these technologies enable us to produce gels that can satisfy rigid tolerance specifications with respect to a wide range of physical characteristics (e.g., thickness, water content, adherence, absorption, moisture vapor transmission rate (a measure of the passage of water vapor through a substance) and release rate) while maintaining product integrity. Additionally, we have the manufacturing ability to offer broad choices in the selection of liners onto which the gels are coated. Consequently, we and our customers are able to determine tolerances in moisture vapor transmission rate and active ingredient release rates while personalizing color and texture.
Contract Manufacturing Business
As described above, we have historically served as a contract manufacturer, supplying our gels to third parties who incorporate them into their own products. Our hydrogels are currently being marketed in the U.S. and abroad by our customers for the following applications:

● | Drug Delivery. We believe delivering medication through hydrogel patches has important advantages over traditional methods of drug delivery. Hydrogel patches are less intrusive, painless, allow for pre-planned medication time periods, can potentially release medication in a manner consistent with the body’s own glandular activity (by avoiding dosage spikes and/or digestive alteration), and minimize side effects related to the medication via injection or ingestion.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other Medical Applications. Hydrogel patches are being used for transdermal applications such as hormone replacement therapy and contraception, treatment of acne, shingles, diabetes, motion sickness, treatment of angina with nitroglycerin and treatment of smoking addiction using nicotine and palliatives (i.e., pain relievers).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Non-Prescription Therapeutic Applications. Hydrogel patches are also used in the medical community and are also directly marketed to consumers for topical application of over the counter (“OTC”) drugs such as non-prescription acne treatments, pain relievers, diet preparations, cough suppressants, treatment of warts, calluses and corns, and pain relief.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Moist Wound and Burn Dressings. Hydrogel dressings have long been used for treating wounds and burns. Clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of moist wound healing versus traditional dressings. Some of these benefits include immediate anti-inflammatory effects, allowing for freer cell flow and less scarring, increased absorption of exudate, and accelerated healing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Components of Medical Devices. Several medical devices utilize hydrogels as components. These devices include active drug delivery systems such as iontophoresis, warming and cooling devices, medical electrodes and various medical products for sensitive skin.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cosmetic Applications. Hydrogel patches and applications allow for delivery systems of cosmetic skin care products to consumers and skin care providers for uses that include moisturizers, face masks, cooling masks and applicators.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe our competitive advantage in each of the general hydrogel patch applications described above is that our hydrogel patches are gentler to the skin because we do not use chemical cross-linking agents which are incorporated into other hydrogel patches. In the past, we have not actively marketed our hydrogel or consumer products but recently hired two salespeople to focus on expanding our customer base and marketing efforts. Once the gels are manufactured according to a customer's specifications, the gels are generally shipped to the customer via a contract carrier (e.g., United Parcel Service, Inc.).
Our Facilities
We manufacture our hydrogels at what we believe to be one of only two facilities that can produce state-of-the-art hydrogel transdermal products and we have successfully used over two hundred active ingredients combinations in our hydrogels to date. Our facility consists of 13,500 square feet of manufacturing space, which we currently operate at only 5% capacity and can expand rapidly to meet increased demand, including for our healthcare and consumer product lines as described in more detail below. At full capacity, our facility should allow for us to produce approximately 1.4 billion square inches of product annually. Additionally, we recently completed a facility accelerator upgrade of approximately $570,000 which we believe will result in a more efficient manufacturing process. Our facility is subject to stringent FDA compliance requirements. We also believe our facility creates a high barrier to entry into our hydrogel and consumer product business.
Consumer Products
Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, we began selling our own branded products using our hydrogel technology on the Amazon marketplace. We currently have nine distinct product offerings which we market under the brand names MedaGel and LumaGel Beauty and intend to offer additional products in 2022 and beyond. The products we sell under our MedaGel brand primarily relate to over-the-counter ("OTC") remedy solutions, such as blister and pain applications; while the products we sell under our LumaGel Beauty brand primarily relate to beauty and cosmetic solutions, such as wrinkle and skin cream applications.
We believe SilverSeal®, a product marketed under our MedaGel brand for OTC wound care in connection with our partnership with Noble Fiber Technologies, Inc. ("Noble Fiber"), may also have applications for skin scar treatment. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with Noble Fiber we pay them a small royalty fee for any Silver Seal® we sell.
Based on supporting clinical data from a forty patient, double blind study, SilverSeal® may reduce scar tissue at a more significant rate that a typical petroleum treatment. The study included 20 patients in each group, with one group being treated with SilverSeal® and the other group treated with the petroleum treatment. Scarring results were evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale ("POSAS"), which includes measuring scar length and width. Patients treated with SilverSeal® demonstrated statistically significant improvements in their POSAS scores as compared to patients in the control group. We have submitted this clinical data for peer review and publication, although we cannot guarantee it will be published. If the results are validated through peer 




view, we will be able claim that SilverSeal® reduces scarring. According to a report by Fior Markets, the scar treatment market is expected to grow to $45 billion by 2028.
In a recent validation study, SilverSeal® was also found to be up to 99% effective in reducing common bacteria, fungus and yeasts that can be present after a superficial skin injury. The positive results of this study allow us to make important claims for its wound care products, particularly its ability to prevent common infections. We believe these antimicrobial properties are important for specific consumer segments such as athletes who often are exposed to infection due to frequent skin tears.
The SilverSeal® study design was as follows:

● | NEXGEL's SilverSeal® product line underwent Test Method 100, which the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) lists as the industry standard for evaluating the antimicrobial efficacy of dressings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The AATCC Test Method 100 is also recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a standard technique for establishing antimicrobial activity within wound dressings for 510(k) filings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Test Method 100 is designed to quantitatively test the ability of fabrics and textiles to inhibit the growth of microorganisms or kill them, over a 24-hour period of contact.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | During this test, control and test fabric swatches were inoculated with microorganisms. Bacteria levels on both control and test fabrics were determined at "time zero" by elution in a large volume of neutralizing broth, followed by dilution and plating.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A control was performed to verify that the neutralization method effectively neutralizes the antimicrobial agent in the fabric. Additional inoculated control and test fabrics were incubated in sealed jars.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The results were taken after the 24-hour period, and the reduction of microorganisms relative to initial concentrations and the control fabric was calculated.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key results from a comparison of SilverSeal® to a standard-of-care gauze pad over a 24-hour interval showed:

● | SilverSeal® was ~99% effective in reducing streptococcus pneumoniae, compared to ~13% efficacy of the reference gauze.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SilverSeal® was ~99% effective in reducing staphylococcus epidermidis, compared to ~17% efficacy of the reference gauze.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SilverSeal® was ~99% effective in reducing faecalis bacterial infection, compared to ~11% efficacy of the reference gauze.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SilverSeal® was ~99% effective in reducing E. coli infection, compared to ~31% efficacy of the reference gauze.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, we have several more products in our development pipeline. We intend for these products to address various market opportunities including the OTC" pharmaceutical drug delivery market, pain management, beauty and cosmetics, sports related applications, cannabinoids (CBD/THC) and general podiatry. We have entered into a partnership with MPG Promotions to assist with our strategy of retail distribution for these various products on an as-needed basis for a flat monthly fee.
Custom and White Label Opportunities
We are also implementing a new strategy to leverage our hydrogel products and technologies by allowing other OTC brands to incorporate them into their products. We believe our hydrogels, which do not use chemical cross-linking agents or parabens but rather use electronic beam energy, will be attractive to other OTC brands, especially in the beauty and cosmetics industry, and their customers. We believe these white labeling opportunities will increase the markets' awareness of us as a consumer-friendly and reliable supplier of customizable patches. Additionally, we created a process where customers have the ability to create their own custom hydrogel products. Customers pay a development fee, eliminating our financial risk in the success or failure of the custom product. As opposed to our contract manufacturing business, where we provide bulk sale of roll stock hydrogel to our customers who then use it as one component 




in their products which they themselves then manufacture, test, market and sell, our custom and white label business will provide customers with a finished product which they will then brand and re-sell.
Medical Devices
We have recently entered into the medical device development sector which a focus on analyzing, creating and developing devices and solutions that reduce skin pain and irritation, improve and maintain skin integrity and provide greater comfort and safety for patients at the site of which a medical device interfaces with the human body.
We conducted proof of concept studies for the development of our first medical device, which we call NEXDrape and have filed for a patent on this device under the Patent Cooperation Treaty which provides patent protection in the nations who are members of the treaty. The NEXDrape device is an incise surgical drape designed for patients with impaired skin. The elderly, diabetics, trauma patients and those with an adhesive sensitivity can have adverse events from the removal of adhesive drapes. Additionally, patients taking certain medications, such as ELIQUIS® and steroids, may experience impaired skin as well. These groups represent a sizable percentage of the incise surgical drape market, a market we believe to be significant and growing. The incise surgical drape market is currently fragmented with 3M Healthcare being the market leader. Skin tears, infections, rashes, and post-surgical site pain are some of the problems that can occur as a result of the removal of adhesive drapes, and have been reported with other currently available surgical drapes.
We have conducted one animal and two human cadaver proof of concept studies with respect to NEXDrape. As a result of these studies, we believe NEXDrape will represent a gentle to the skin alternative to the current adhesive based standard of care and will provide a unique solution for patients with fragile or compromised skin. Additionally, we believe NEXDrape offers the following benefits over the current incise surgical drape products: (i) no skin irritation; (ii) able to deliver a wide range of antiseptic and antibiotic agents; (iii) eliminates air bubbles; and (iv) prevents dermis removal post-surgery, which reduces the risk of patient infection and discomfort. We intend to file a 510(k) premarket submission with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is an application to demonstrate that NEXDrape is as safe and effective (or substantially equivalent to) a legally marketed surgical drape device. There can be no guarantee that the FDA approves our application, if submitted.
We are also in the process of developing a product we call NEXDerm which will be an adhesive tape designed to secure central lines and intravenous tubes and devices to patients before, during and after medical treatment. We believe NEXDerm will be an attractive alternative to Tegaderm(TM), a 3M Healthcare product. Based on our discussion with medical professionals, Tegaderm(TM) is often difficult and painful to remove after adhesion, particularly for comprised skin patients. NEXDerm, which will incorporate exclusively licensed technology owned by Noble Fiber, is designed to create a gentle to skin surgical tape impregnated with antimicrobial X-Static® silver fiber. We believe NEXDerm, if successfully developed, will offer the following advantages over Tegaderm(TM): (i) ability to easily reposition the adhesive tape; (ii) pain-free removal; (iii) gentle to the skin; and (iv) increased infection prevention. As with NEXDrape, we intend to file a 510(k) premarket submission with the FDA to demonstrate that NEXDrape is as safe and effective (or substantially equivalent to) a legally marketed surgical drape device. There can be no guarantee that the FDA approves our application, if submitted.
We are also in the early stages of exploring opportunities to develop a number of other potential medical devices. Our current intent with any medical devices will not be to commercialize due to the expense required but to potentially prepare them to go to market and to identify and pursue licensing and partnering arrangements with third parties possessing the necessary resources and capabilities to bring the devices to market.
Sales and Marketing
Contract Manufacturing, Consumer Products and Customer and White Label Offerings. We continue to focus on sales and marketing efforts in the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any employees solely dedicated to sales, however, some of our employees perform in a sales capacity in addition to their other duties and we did hire one employee solely dedicated to sale in the first quarter of 2022. In February 2021, the Company began contracting two independent salesmen for current year sales efforts that have been and will continue to focus contract manufacturing, consumer products and white label offering businesses.
Medical Devices. We do not intend to spend efforts or resources on selling or marketing our medical device business. Our current intent with any medical devices will not be to commercialize due to the expense required but to identify and pursue licensing arrangements with third parties possessing the necessary resources and capabilities to bring the devices to market.



Competition
Contract Manufacturing. To our knowledge, NexGel is one of three manufacturers using electron beam technology for high performance hydrogels for the wound care, cosmetic and drug delivery industries. 
Consumer Products and Medical Devices. As we expand our consumer products and medical device business, we will face a number of competitors. Our competitors include numerous manufacturers; distributors; marketers; online, specialty, mass, and other retailers; and physicians that actively compete for the business of consumers both in the United States and abroad, including companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Consumer Healthcare and Procter & Gamble. Most of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, better-developed and more innovative sales and distribution channels and platforms, greater name recognition, and larger established customer bases than we do. Therefore, a strategic partnership will be critical to our success in the medical device business. We also face similar challenges with our own consumer branded products and may pursue similar strategic partnerships, though direct to consumer marketing and selling is more feasible. 
Custom and White Label Offerings. As our custom and white label offering business will provide customers with a finished product which they will then brand and re-sell, the competition will depend, to a great deal, on the type of product the customer request and will not result in direct competition to us.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Principal Suppliers
In general, raw materials essential to our business are readily available from multiple sources. For reasons of quality assurance, availability, or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. The principal suppliers for our raw materials are Berry Global, Inc., DeWolf Chemical, Inc., and Univar, Inc. Our policy is to maintain sufficient inventory of components and raw materials so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time.
Because we have no direct control over these suppliers, interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion. In addition, if such suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the necessary components or raw materials, we may be unable to redesign or adapt our technology to work without such components or raw materials or find alternative suppliers or manufacturers. In such events, we could experience interruptions, delays, increased costs, quality control problems, and or be unable to sell the applicable products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue.
Other than as discussed above, we believe that, due to the size and scale of production of our suppliers, there should be an adequate supply of components and raw materials from our other suppliers.
Customers
During the year ended December 31, 2021, three major customers accounted for approximately 42% of our revenue, with each customer individually accounting for 15%, 14%, and 13% respectively. We cannot be certain as to these customers’ intentions to use our services during and beyond the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 since we do not currently have a contract with these customers. However, we have been supplying these customers for more than 15 years and have no reason to anticipate any change. Our contract manufacturing business, including with respect to these customers, operates on a purchase order basis.
Patents, Proprietary Rights and Trademarks
We own or license trademarks covering our company and our products. We filed for a patent on NEXDrape under the Patent Cooperation Treaty which provides patent protection in the nations who are members of the treaty. We also rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position. We also hold certain intellectual property that is not material to our current business and prospects, including patent rights to one patent in Europe, which covers the use of lignin for inhibiting restenosis and thrombosis formation, and coated medical devices where the coating includes lignin. This patent is set to expire in the near future, however we believe the expiration of these patents will not have an adverse impact on our overall business. In addition, in connection with our Spin-Off, we received an exclusive license with right to sub-license from Specialty Pharmaceutical Products, L.L.C. (which was held by Adynxx) to two issued patents, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, which cover technology relating to a 




transdermal patch containing transcutol. The transdermal patch is effective to deliver lidocaine to a patient. Neither of these patent rights are material to our current business and prospects. These licensed patent rights are expected to expire in April 2032.
 Government Regulation
Product Regulation. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, medical devices are classified by the FDA into one of three classes - Class I, Class II or Class III - depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. While some applications of hydrogels fall under the jurisdiction of the FDA, hydrogels are generally classified as Class I exempt devices and the majority of the hydrogel products that we manufacture are thereby exempt from the FDA filing of any regulatory submissions and/or pre-market notification requirements. To the extent that any FDA regulatory submissions are required, we will be required to file these submissions and maintain all appropriate documentation. With respect to registering the manufacturing facility with the FDA under the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 CFR 820.1, Scope: Part A, it is stated that the regulation does not apply to manufacturers of component parts of finished devices. Currently, hydrogels are sold as component parts to various medical device/cosmetic manufacturers.
 Quality Assurance Requirements. The FDA enforces regulations to ensure that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs and medical devices conform with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP). The CGMP regulations enforced by the FDA are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations, from receipt of raw materials to finished product distribution, insofar as they bear upon whether drugs meet all the identity, strength, quality and purity characteristics required of them. The CGMP regulations for devices, called the Quality System Regulation, are also comprehensive and cover all aspects of device manufacture, from pre-production design validation to installation and servicing, insofar as they bear upon the safe and effective use of the device and whether the device otherwise meets the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.To assure compliance requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas.
The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of drug and device registered facilities to assess their current CGMP status. If the FDA were to find serious non-compliant manufacturing or processing practices during such an inspection, it could take regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. With respect to domestic establishments, the FDA could initiate product seizures or in some instances require product recalls and seek to enjoin a product’s manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could support civil penalties and criminal prosecutions. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a company is not in compliance with CGMP requirements, sanctions may be imposed that include preventing that company from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying that company as an “unacceptable supplier”, thereby disqualifying that company from selling products to federal agencies. 
We conduct audits of our outside manufacturers and believe that we and our suppliers and outside manufacturers are currently in compliance with CGMP requirements. We are currently registered as a device manufacturer and distributor with the FDA and we intend to register as a drug facility with the FDA when we are required to do so.
Environmental Regulation. We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations. We cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements in all material respects. However, we cannot assure you that current or future regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse effect on our performance, results or financial condition.
In the future, if a loss contingency related to environmental matters, employee safety, health or conditional asset retirement obligations is recognized, we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded. The investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time, and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, or cash flow, nor can we assure you that such liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on our performance, results or financial condition.




 ​
Federal and State Anti-kickback, Self-referral, False Claims and Similar Laws. Our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex, and even minor, inadvertent violations can give rise to claims that the relevant law has been violated. Certain states have similar fraud and abuse laws, imposing substantial penalties for violations. Any government investigation or a finding of a violation of these laws would likely result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims in all material respects.
​
 Research and Development Costs
​
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred approximately $31 thousand and $0, respectively, in research and development costs. We expect to incur increased costs in the future for our medical device business. Research and development will be an important component in the growth of our business.
​
Employees
​
As of December 31, 2021, we had ten full-time employees. Of these employees, three are involved with finance, sales, marketing, and administration and seven are involved with manufacturing and regulatory matters. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or other collective bargaining groups, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. We currently plan to retain and utilize the services of outside consultants for additional research, testing, regulatory, accounting and tax services, legal compliance, and other services on an as needed basis.
​
Properties
 ​
We maintain a combined corporate office and manufacturing facility in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, where we lease approximately 16,500 square feet of office and manufacturing space. Our lease expires on January 31, 2026. We believe that our facility is well maintained and are suitable and adequate for our current needs.
​
Legal Proceedings
​
From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims.
​
There are no material proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates or any registered or beneficial shareholder of more than 5% of our common stock is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.
​
Contractual Obligations
​
The Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is not required to provide the information under this item.
