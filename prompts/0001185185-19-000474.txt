Item 1.    Description of Business
 
Description of business, principal products, services and their markets
 
Acacia Diversified Holdings, Inc. (“we”, “us”, the “Company”, or the “Parent Company”) was incorporated in Texas on October 1, 1984 as Gibbs Construction, Inc. (“Gibbs”). The Company changed its name from Gibbs Construction, Inc. to Acacia Automotive, Inc. effective February 20, 2007. On October 18, 2012, the Company changed its name from Acacia Automotive, Inc. to Acacia Diversified Holdings, Inc. in an effort to exemplify the Company’s desire to expand into alternative industries as well as more diversified service and product offerings.  
 
On January 15, 2016, the Company acquired the assets of the MariJ Group of companies that included MariJ Agricultural, JR Cannabis Industries, LLC and Canna-Cures Research & Development Center, LLC.  The transaction had an effective date of January 4, 2016. On January 19, 2016 the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing the acquisition. The Company subsequently filed expanded and updated information relating to that acquisition on its Amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A on April 25, 2016.  That document is available for viewing on the Company’s website at http://www.acacia.bz/sec/sec.htm and on the SEC website at:

In 2016, following the acquisition, the Company formed two new subsidiaries to conduct its new medical hemp business activities, being MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“MariJ Pharma”) and Canna-Cures Research & Development Center, Inc. (“Canna-Cures”). In 2017, the Company formed a new subsidiary Eufloria Medical of Tennessee, Inc. (“EMT”) to conduct its retail business in the state of Tennessee. In July 2018, the Company announced the completion of its acquisition of Medahub Operations Group, Inc. and Medahub, Inc., technology companies (“Medahub”), complete with a current compounding pharmacy license in Florida.
 
MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

MariJ Pharma has a proprietary mobile CO2, supercritical hemp oil extraction unit which was USDA certified Organic on September 28th, 2016, by OneCert, under the US National Organic Program; 7 CFR PART 205. MariJ Pharma extracts and processes very high quality, high-cannabinoid profile content medical grade hemp oils from medicinal hemp plants.  MariJ specializes in organic strains of the plant where available, setting itself apart from the general producers of non-organic products.    
 
During 2018, the Company performed its extraction activity in the state of North Carolina where its activities are deemed legal under the laws of such state.
 
Canna-Cures Research & Development Center, Inc.
 
Canna-Cures engaged in research and development activities as well as retail and wholesale distribution of medicinal hemp products and dietary supplements in Colorado until it closed operations in July 2017.  As a part of its R&D efforts, Canna-Cures sought to align itself with institutions of higher learning in working to develop new products and to identify and develop additional uses for its medicinal hemp products.
 
Canna-Cures launched its first research and development center in Colorado. In conjunction with that opening, Canna-Cures officially launched the Dahlia’s Botanicals Endocannabinoid Nutraceuticals product line.  A portion of the proceeds from our Dahlia’s Botanicals line are awarded to the Canna Moms 501(c)(3) organization in support of its continuing public education and awareness campaign.
 
Eufloria Medical of Tennessee, Inc.
 
In July 2018, the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eufloria Medical of Tennessee, Inc. (“EMT”), an entity focused on the growing and distribution of new and proprietary medicinal hemp products for patients. EMT intends to utilize MariJ Pharma's USDA certified organic mobile processing and handling solutions for its customers, and technology solutions for the expanding physician market, has leased a 14-acre farm with 32,000 square feet of indoor growing area in southern Tennessee.  EMT also acquired an option to purchase the farm upon favorable terms, which option, EMT intends to exercise as soon as possible.  During 2018, EMT completed excavation and other cleanup activities and developed the farm into its first grow facility, allowing for improved efficiencies through growing, processing and manufacturing the Company’s own product line and building sales through dedicated distributors.  The Company will grow its own plant material, process that plant material through another wholly owned subsidiary, MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“MariJ”) and manufacture consumer products with the “EUFLORIA” branding for the dedicated distribution channels.

EMT also commenced its retail and wholesale distribution of medicinal hemp products and dietary supplements in Tennessee. In addition to our current extraction operations, the Company has been invited to be part of the hemp pilot program in Tennessee. This program provides the Company the license to grow, manufacture, and dispense USDA organic hemp oil in Tennessee and represents the first step in moving its operations to the east coast of the United States. The Company plans on participating in this pilot program through this new, wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
Medahub, Inc. 
 
In July 2018, the Company announced the completion of its acquisition of Medahub Operations Group, Inc. and Medahub, Inc., technology companies (“Medahub”), complete with a current compounding pharmacy license in Florida. The Medahub acquisition allows the Company to be fully HIPAA compliant and cloud based on an HL7 platform. The Company can now offer licensing agreements for other hemp companies wanting to be HIPAA compliant from left to right or seed to sale and Doctor to Patient. The Company is continuing to develop the capabilities of this technology ahead of marketing this platform to users.
 
Distribution methods of the products and services
 
MariJ Pharma extracts and processes a very high quality, high-cannabinoid profile content medical grade hemp oils from medicinal hemp plants in its propriety mobile CO2, supercritical hemp oil extraction unit which was USDA certified Organic on September 28th, 2016, by OneCert, under the US National Organic Program; 7 CFR PART205. The finished product is then delivered to its customers.
 
EMT plans to sell medicinal hemp products and dietary supplements primarily through its retail dispensaries in Tennessee and through a dedicated distribution model.
 
Status of any publicly announced new products or services
 
During 2018, the Company acquired Medahub to develop its proprietary GeoTrackingTechnology that is fully compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability standard (“HIPAA”) utilizing its “plant to patient” solution. This GeoTraking Technology is designed to provide a full-channel patient care tracking system that is fully compliant under today’s strict HIPAA regulations that require privacy and security of the patient’s information. Beginning with RFID labeling and tracking of every single seed employed in the grow program and continuing through the sale of medicinal products in a sophisticated retail Point of Sale delivery system.
 
The Company also plans to enter into research and development projects with institutions of higher learning in efforts to:  (i) develop new and better strains of medical hemp related products for dispensing as medications, nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, and potential dietary supplements; and (ii) provide private label packaging services; and (iii) sell additional medical hemp oils, oil-infused products, and other merchandise through its web-based portal or retail dispensaries planned for that purpose; and (iv) sell cosmeceutical and nutraceutical products and dietary supplements containing its high-quality hemp oil extracts.
 
The Company currently does not have sufficient working capital to pursue our business plan in its entirety as described herein. Our ability to implement our business plan will depend on our ability to obtain sufficient working capital and to fund our operations. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain additional capital, or, if available, that such capital will be available at terms acceptable to us, or that we will be able to generate profit from operations, or if profits are generated, that they will be sufficient to carry out our business plans, or that the plans will not be modified.
 
Competitive business conditions and the Company’s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition
 
Any industry served by the Company is likely to be highly competitive across the entire United States and the rest of the world. In particular, the hemp industry, being the impetus of all the Company’s attention at this juncture, is very highly competitive and has drawn thousands of competing entities.  While the Company believes its technology, programs, and plans place it in a posture to compete at the highest levels, the sheer numbers of competitors must be recognized. The Company has elected to devote the majority of its efforts on production and sales of its products and services within the continental United States but may institute operations in diverse countries.  Even so, the Company must be considered as currently competing with other companies in diverse countries that can potentially produce and sell competitive products at lower prices.  While the Company believes that there are other hurdles for those foreign entities to overcome, including the high cost of international shipping to U.S. buyers, we believe that they nonetheless can compete with us in our markets.  We will potentially compete with a variety of companies, both domestic and international, and as such will be subject to various levels of competition.

There is no assurance the Company will be able to adhere to its plans or to engage in any acquisitions or mergers.  The Company will consider potential opportunities to buy, sell or distribute its products in other countries.
 
Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers
 
One of the ingredients used in the extraction process is carbon dioxide. MariJ Pharma depends on a supplier to supply high quality carbon dioxide. This supplier produces the highest quality carbon dioxide for the medicinal hemp industry. If MariJ Pharma was not able to obtain carbon dioxide from this supplier, it would need to look to other suppliers to supply this critical ingredient. However, the quality of the ingredient would suffer and the Company may not be able to obtain it at reasonable cost. At the present time, the Company is not anticipating a disruption of service by this supplier, whose identity we choose to keep confidential.
 
Dependence on one or a few major customers
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company’s revenues were concentrated on two customers, WNC Hemp and CFH, Inc., who accounted for approximately 59% and 21%, of the total consolidated revenues, respectively.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s revenues were concentrated on three customers, CBD Rx, Precision Cultivation, Inc. and Blue Circle Development, Inc., who accounted for approximately 33%, 28% and 32%, of the total consolidated revenues, respectively.
 
Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts, including duration
 
The Company currently has patents pending, trademarks pending, and no franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. The Company intends to acquire, through its MariJ Pharma subsidiary, portions or complete ownership of licenses and grow operations in one or more states and is seeking to cultivate, organically extract and process its medicinal hemp crops year around in indoor facilities.  The acquisition of these licenses is anticipated to provide the Company with the opportunity to compound medicinal products using mixtures of high cannabinoid profile oils that have very little hallucinogenic properties but have significantly improved medicinal properties.
 
Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business
 
Congress voted in December 2018 to legalize the cultivation of hemp in the United States, after months of debate and negotiation between lawmakers. Hemp legalization was tucked into the 2018 farm bill, a massive piece of legislation that also addresses issues such as nutrition, conservation, trade, energy and forestry. The bill received strong bipartisan support, and the President signed it into law.
 
Now that hemp is legal, there are all kinds of implications for farmers, researchers and consumers. For decades, the federal government has treated hemp just like any other cannabis plant. Since 1970, it had been classified as a schedule 1 drug on the Drug Enforcement Administration's list of controlled substances, alongside heroin, LSD and marijuana. The DEA defines schedule 1 drugs as having no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. The new bill takes hemp off that list. The schedule 1 designation made universities reluctant to get involved in hemp research. With hemp being legalized now, those restrictions and hesitations about legal jeopardy have been removed. 
 
The Company, through its new subsidiaries, will operate in the medical hemp sector.  In order to help our shareholders better understand the products we intend to employ in our business plans, we have provided certain explanations and definitions below.
 
The Company will initially extract and process a derivative of the hemp plant known as CBD oil. CBD is one of dozens of compounds found in hemp plants that belong to a class called cannabinoids. Of these compounds, CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC and THC are usually present in the highest concentrations and have the most common practical applications in the medical field.  The Company’s subsidiaries currently give most attention to high-CBD/low-THC products.  Marijuana, unlike most modern-day medicine, contains a wide range of chemical compounds. Scientists have identified to date, over 114 unique molecules in hemp known as cannabinoids, which include THC and CBD. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant, but these are the compounds that are most addressed as having a use by the medical community.
 
Terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana’s smell, among other things, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own. In fact, while THC has gotten most of the attention, studies suggest many of the compounds in marijuana work together to produce a synergy of effects. This is known as the “entourage effect.”

CBD and THC levels tend to vary between different strains and varieties of hemp.  By using selective breeding techniques, certain growers have managed to create varieties with high levels of CBD, CBG and THCA, being the varieties currently employed for oil production by the Company’s MariJ Pharmaceuticals subsidiary.  That subsidiary also specialized in extracting oil from certified organic plants, rather than the standard non-organic varieties.
 
Unlike THC; CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN do not cause a high or hallucinogenic effect. The reason why CBD is non-psychoactive is due to its lack of affinity for CB1 receptors, such as are found in high concentrations in the brain, and which become the channels through which THC is able to port its psychoactive effects.
 
Like most other companies in this industry, we are subject to various business regulations, permits and licenses. The Company, through its new subsidiaries, has entered a new business realm that may entail considerably more regulation than its previous endeavors. The Company believes that it has complied with appropriate state requirements for operations and believes it has obtained all permits necessary to function under the current state regulations where we have business operations.
 
Despite the passage of the Farm Bill, inherent risks continue to exist in this industry as a result of the determination by many nationally-chartered banks. As such, some businesses maintain large sums of cash on hand, and meeting payrolls and accounts payable obligations with cash rather than checks.  As a result, those businesses are placed at high risk of internal and external theft and crimes relating to the lack of controls and security afforded by transactional banking.  The Company is currently utilizing various financial institutions for its deposit needs, but this still creates risks when the proceeds at diverse production locations, often themselves in cash due to the same issues, cannot be deposited in nearby accessible depositories.  The Company has an armored vehicle for use in the transport of cash and hemp products but believes those risks will not be minimized until national depository institutions allow hemp-related businesses to utilize their facilities.
 
Estimate of the amount of money spent during each of the last two fiscal years on research and development
 
The Company spent a de-minimus amount on research and development during its last two fiscal years.
 
Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws
 
The hemp industry, just like other industries, impacts our environment. Environmental laws relating to water rights, energy consumption, pollution, and overall carbon footprint all can and do impact the hemp industry.
 
While some areas of environmental law focus on the protection of the environment, others are designed to control human use of natural resources by setting up a system of environmental approvals. Environmental laws cover topics such as chemicals and pesticides, climate change and energy, coastal, marine and fisheries management, farming and private land management, forestry, clearing vegetation, trees, marine, pollution, water, just to name a few. Given all the facets of both indoor, outdoor, and greenhouse cultivation, in addition to chemical-intensive extractions and infusions of hemp oil products, it is easy to see why environmental laws are coming into play in the cannabis industry.
 
One of the most common environmental law issues for the hemp industry is waste management. Most states that legalize some form of hemp consumption strictly dictate the disposition and storage of the hemp by-products, as well as the types of pesticides, soil amendments, and fertilizers that can be safely applied to cannabis crops.
 
However, fewer states have enacted laws dealing with the industry’s impact on water and air quality, but the industry is certainly under more scrutiny. In certain states, producers and processors must pay a fee to their local or state government and submit an application for a permit, provide information on odor control equipment for producing, growing, or processing and solvent usage information for each type.
 
Energy consumption by hemp growers is also becoming an important issue. The significant use of electricity in indoor hemp production has caused concerns for the carbon-footprint of its production. States may pass legislatures to regulate energy consumption by passing the cost of such effects and consumption onto the hemp industry by instituting licensing and permitting fees.
 
Outdoor growers are not completely free of environmental concerns. They are also facing pressure under environmental laws because outdoor growing has led to deforestation, loss of wildlife, and erosion, and it often requires large amounts of water and pesticides.
 
Number of total employees and number of full-time employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a total of nine employees, six of which are full time.
