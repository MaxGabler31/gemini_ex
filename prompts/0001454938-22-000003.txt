Item 1. Business
Outbrain Inc., together with our subsidiaries, (“Outbrain”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) was incorporated in August 2006 in Delaware. The Company is headquartered in New York, New York and has wholly owned subsidiaries in Israel, Europe, Asia, Brazil and Australia.
On July 22, 2021, the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333- 257525), filed on June 29, 2021, as amended, was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) of the Company’s common stock, and its common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on July 23, 2021. On July 27, 2021, the Company closed its IPO and issued 8,000,000 shares of its common stock at an initial offering price of $20.00 per share, receiving aggregate net proceeds of $145.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs.
Our mission is to help digital media owners thrive by recommending content, products and services that users love.
Outbrain is a leading recommendation platform powering the open web. Outbrain’s technology provides personalization, engagement and monetization solutions to thousands of digital media properties, including many of the world’s most prestigious publishers. Through powering discovery feeds on the open web, Outbrain helps over a billion unique users on a monthly basis discover content, offers, services and products they might be interested in. For tens of thousands of advertisers around the world, Outbrain helps attract new customers and grow their businesses, driving measurable results and return on investment.
Over the past decade, consumers have become increasingly accustomed to seeing highly curated digital content and ads that align with their unique interests. Similar to the way in which social media and search have simplified discovery by synthesizing billions of consumer data points to offer personalized feeds, we provide media partners with a platform that encompasses data at scale as well as prediction and recommendation capabilities, helping media partners deliver a discovery feed personalized to their users, based on context and each user’s interests and preferences. 
Consumption of content continues to shift online, with over four billion consumers accessing the Internet primarily through mobile devices, where scrolling through a feed experience is habitually expected by consumers on every page. According to eMarketer, the average person in the United States is expected to spend more than eight hours a day consuming digital media in 2022. In addition, the estimated average use of U.S. consumer’s mobile device grew from 87 minutes per day in 2012 to 264 minutes per day in 2021, a 203% increase. According to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University, 73% of people access news through side-doors, not through the homepages of publications. We believe this means discovery feeds on article pages are more important than ever to help users navigate what to read, watch, or buy next.
Our platform is built for user engagement and, as a mobile-first company, is designed to be highly effective on mobile devices. Outbrain’s technology is deployed on the mobile apps and websites of most of our media partners, generating 68% of our revenue in 2021. 
Outbrain operates a two-sided marketplace, which means we have full exclusive control over all aspects of the user experiences, allowing us to quickly test and deploy new formats for our constituents. Since inception, we have been guided by the same core principles pertaining to our three constituents: media partners, users, and advertisers. 
Media Partners. We are committed to the long-term success of our media partners. Consistent with this philosophy, we focus on establishing a true win-win partnership. We strive to develop trusted, transparent, multi-year contracts with media partners, which are typically exclusive with us. Our media partners include both traditional publishers and companies in new and rapidly evolving categories such as mobile device manufacturers and web browsers.
Users. We believe that by focusing on improving the user experience we are able to cultivate user behavior patterns that compound engagement over time, delivering superior long-term monetization for ourselves and for our media partners.
Advertisers. We strive to grow our advertising business by increasing overall user engagement, rather than price per engagement. Our emphasis on user engagement helps us improve advertisers’ return on ad spend (“ROAS”) thus unlocking more advertising spend and attracting more advertisers. In turn this enables us to better match ads to users and further grow user engagement and overall monetization.
We have delivered nearly $4 billion in direct revenue to our media partners, since inception. We partner with thousands of the world’s most trusted digital media owners for which we believe we are an important technology partner. Some key media partners with which we have longstanding relationships across our various regions include Asahi Shimbun, CNN, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, MSN, Sky News and Sky Sports, and The Washington Post. The average tenure of our top 20 media partners, based on our 2021 revenue, is over seven years.
Through our direct, usually exclusive, integrations with media partners, we have become one of the largest online advertising platforms on the open web. In 2021, we provided personalized feeds and ads to over 1 billion monthly unique users, delivering on average over 10 billion recommendations to content, services and products per day, with over 24,000 advertisers directly using our platform. 
Our platform is user engagement focused. A significant proportion of the engagement created by our platform is with the content of the media partner for which we are providing the platform, which we refer to as ‘organic recommendations.’ Outbrain is trusted to power organic recommendations across all publisher media types, including written editorial, video and audio content. This provides the user with a personalized content experience, while increasing time spent and engagement on the media partner’s digital properties. We believe this is crucial to increasing long-term loyalty and retention of users for media partners, while increasing the depth and value of user visits in the short term. Powering a feed of both organic recommendations and targeted ads creates significant proprietary, first-party data that enables us to continuously refine our prediction algorithms, supporting our efforts to further increase engagement.
Advertisers use our platform to reach consumers efficiently through various ad formats across thousands of premium digital media properties around the world. Our platform provides access to a significant volume of exclusive ad inventory within the content feeds of these premium digital media properties. Advertisers primarily use our platform for performance driven campaigns, with measurable outcomes. Our ability to drive value and ROAS for advertisers, at scale, is highlighted in the growth of ad spend through our platform. In 2021, we invested significant R&D resources to automate and optimize the ROAS for our advertisers, which expanded the variety of content experiences and ad experiences we serve our audience. We now support native recommendations (image + text) formats, standard display formats and a wide variety of video formats, providing full funnel opportunities for our advertising clients, from driving awareness through direct response and driving conversions.
Data and algorithms are fundamental to everything we do. We process billions of data signals per minute, powering up to 200 million Click Through Rate (“CTR”) predictions and over 100,000 recommendations per second. This drives our ability to deliver close to 40 million engagements per day. Our ability to collect and synthesize large data sets into our real-time decisioning engine powers our recommendations, our feed experiences and our ad targeting, helping us optimize user engagement and monetization. As our platform grows, we are able to leverage our data scale in order to enhance our algorithms, enabling us to improve the efficacy of our platform. This, in turn, drives additional user engagement and thus more monetization for our partners and ourselves, which helps us further grow our business and scale our data. We refer to this phenomenon as our data flywheel. Engagements with our recommendations include user clicks on one of our recommendation links and views of a video that we recommended. We believe engagements are an indicator of the value users find in our recommendations and the value we create for our media partners through increased monetization.
We are targeting a large, fragmented and growing market. eMarketer states that approximately $492 billion was spent on global digital advertising in 2021, and by 2024, this figure is expected to increase to $717 billion. Approximately 40% of the world’s population has yet to gain access to the Internet. We believe a second factor will complement the increased activity of more people arriving online: the significant majority of consumption and economic activity, such as retail, still takes place offline. As the migration to online takes place, there remains significant future growth potential in eCommerce, given that just 13% of total retail sales in the United States in 2021 occurred online, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Online retail sales are both growing and fragmenting. We believe this represents an opportunity as the broader ecosystem of retailers seek advertising and technology partners to support their continued online growth. Advertisers increasingly expect measurable impact from their digital advertising investment, often preferring to pay for outcomes rather than pay for media, according to a 2020 Jounce market outlook report. Within digital advertising, more engaging and user-friendly formats, such as native and video, represent the fastest growing segments for ad spend, outgrowing search and traditional forms of display, according to eMarketer. Given our ability to deliver high impact and measurable performance to our advertisers, significant reach and unique inventory, we believe that we are well positioned to capture a significant share of this growing market.
We have a track record of consistently growing our business, and have achieved significant scale with over $1 billion of revenue in 2021. Our business is profitable and we are benefiting from strong operating leverage as we grow. Our net income was $11.0 million, or 4.6% of gross profit in 2021, compared to $4.4 million, or 2.6% of gross profit in 2020. Our gross profit was $240.3 million in 2021, up from $165.1 million in 2020, representing year over year growth of 45.6%. Our Ex-TAC Gross Profit was $272.1 million in 2021, up from $194.3 million in 2020, representing year over year growth of 40.0%. Our Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $88.9 million in 2021, from $41.1 million in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was 32.7% and 21.2% of Ex-TAC Gross Profit in 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for definitions and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures, such as Ex-TAC Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Ex-TAC Gross Profit, to the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Our Industry
Advertising is the primary business model for digital media on the open web. In addition, advertising is also increasingly used as a key revenue driver for other Internet based businesses, such as mobile gaming and eCommerce. As a result, digital advertising not only subsidizes media consumption for billions of consumers globally, but also finances the creation of journalism, news, and entertainment, while lowering the costs to consumers of various products and services.
We believe that the following industry trends are relevant to our business:
Proliferation of digital media, and digital advertising, particularly across mobile environments. As mentioned above, the consumption of content continues to shift to digital and primarily to mobile devices. In order to address this change, most media providers have shifted their focus from traditional means of content delivery to digital ones, with new ‘digital-native’ providers increasingly gaining attention. Advertising spend follows time spent and engagement, and mobile ad spend is expected to increase at a faster pace than digital ad spend in total. According to eMarketer, in 2021 global digital ad spend grew to $492 billion, a 29.1% year over year increase, exceeding growth expectations, and mobile ad spend grew to $369 billion, a 32.4% year over year increase. Of that, 40.2% was expected to go to search, with 55.2% expected to go to forms of display advertising, including native and video. The percentage of total media ad spending in digital was 63.0% in 2021 and is projected to be 65.9% in 2022, 68.5% in 2023, 70.3% in 2024 and 72.0% in 2025. Advertisers increasingly expect measurable impact from their digital advertising investment, often preferring to pay for outcomes rather than pay for media, according to a 2020 Jounce market outlook report. Within Digital Advertising, more engaging and user-friendly formats such as native and video represent the fastest growing segments for ad spend, outgrowing Search and traditional forms of Display, according to eMarketer.
Consumer habits and expectations are changing. Consumers have grown accustomed to consuming engaging content that is personalized and curated across multiple digital formats, including social, entertainment, gaming and audio. In mobile environments, consumers habitually scroll through apps, mobile browsers and news feeds, such as those found on social media, providing continuous opportunities to deliver personalized advertising experiences. As a result, we believe that personalized and engaging digital content experiences, supported by non-intrusive ads, have become the expectation of media owners, rather than a consumer luxury. As an example, digital video remains a fast-growth category of content consumption and advertising spend and video is expected to account for more than half of all US programmatic display ad spending in 2022. 
Trusted editorial content is becoming increasingly important. The massive scale of content creation and distribution across social media has made it difficult to curb the creation and proliferation of factually inaccurate news and misinformation, leading to a growing distrust of user-generated social media content. In a Kantar Dimensions study published in May 2020, social media was ranked as the least trusted medium, with only 17% of consumers citing Facebook and Twitter as reputable sources of information. We believe this is a trend that will continue: a 2021 study from The Trusted Web Foundation found that visiting news outlets directly remains the most common way of consuming news online, with more than twice as many respondents citing this method as compared with engaging with links on social media. At the same time, advertisers are growing increasingly concerned about having their messages shown alongside unsavory user-generated content. According to the CMO Council, 72% of advertisers are concerned about brand integrity on social media. As a result, advertisers have become increasingly cognizant of where they spend ad dollars, seeking media environments that prioritize quality, transparency and brand safety. 
Performance and ROAS are becoming increasingly important to advertisers. As digital advertising continues to consume a larger share of advertiser budgets, the ability to target advertising based on specific user interests and context, in real-time, has become increasingly important to advertisers, as it contributes to more efficient campaigns and improved ROAS. This creates demand for solutions that can adjust in real-time while measuring and optimizing for specific price and performance thresholds. As tools for targeting and tracking become more sophisticated and effective, advertisers are increasingly relying on performance pricing models to drive more measurable ROAS, for example, paying for a click (cost-per-click), lead, acquisition, download, install, or sale, instead of paying to simply display an ad which may or may not create value. According to a 2021 report by the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PwC Advisory Services LLC, the most significant and growing proportion of all internet advertising revenues have been priced on a performance basis, 67.1% in 2020 versus 62.9% in 2019. Many advertisers, including the largest brands, leverage third-party software and predictive data-driven models to meet their performance goals. In parallel, increasingly user friendly and engagement-focused formats of digital advertising have evolved to better serve advertisers seeking performance and ROAS.
Data-driven decisioning delivers better experiences and outcomes.   Advances in software and hardware along with the growing use of the Internet have made it possible to collect and rapidly process massive amounts of real-time data signals related to content, context and performance. Leveraging data at scale, advertising technology providers can dynamically serve content or ads that integrate seamlessly into user environments to deliver tailored, impactful experiences. The decisioning intelligence developed by leading technology providers and large Internet platforms has made advertising more engaging for users and more effective for advertisers. As a result, advertisers are increasingly focused on data-driven decisioning, making these capabilities critical for media partners, as they seek to deliver quality experiences to their users while maintaining their relevance with advertisers.
The Challenge for Digital Media Owners
As the pace of online content creation and consumption continues to accelerate, and competition for user attention intensifies, digital media owners must focus on their core strength: creating relevant, interesting, quality content. However, their success also depends on sustainably attracting, engaging, retaining and monetizing audiences while competing with the major social and aggregation platforms, known as the ‘walled gardens.’ These platforms, driven by the nature of their services and their scale, have significant resources to invest in technology and have amassed large volumes of coveted user data, enabling them to deliver highly targeted and thus effective ads alongside user generated or third-party content, helping them achieve an outsized share of the advertising market.
As a result, we believe that digital media owners, whose properties are often referred to as the ‘open web,’ face challenges in the following key areas:
User experience. In today’s dynamic, mobile-first environment, providing a high-quality user experience that addresses consumer habits and expectations is critical to attracting, engaging and retaining audiences. For example, over the past few years, consumers have grown accustomed to receiving personalized content recommendations, which are now common within the walled gardens. In addition, infinite scrolling feeds of content have also become popular, especially on mobile devices. Keeping pace with these changes, as well as other emerging products and features, represents a significant challenge to many digital media owners who lack the scale and resources required to compete.
Monetization. The fragmented ecosystem of digital advertising technology intermediaries, constantly evolving landscape of ad formats and the growing sophistication of advertisers seeking measurable ROAS makes it difficult for digital media owners to develop and maintain the technology required to optimize their monetization. In addition, digital media owners often lack access to a large and diverse advertiser base. As a result, they may not benefit from the variety of ads that are necessary in order to optimize consumer engagement and thus overall monetization.
Our Solution
We enable digital media owners to provide their users with an experience that is personalized and relevant to their interests while generating incremental revenue through highly engaging content recommendations and relevant advertisements. Our platform is informed by large, proprietary data sets. Our recommendation engine relies on advanced artificial intelligence technology and machine learning algorithms.

•Transparency builds trust and alignment.   By maintaining transparency on pricing, data collection and efficacy, we align our incentives with those of our partners and work to ensure their objectives are achieved, driving the long-term success of our business.
Our Offering for Media Partners
We provide media partners with an ‘operating system’ that helps them manage and grow their businesses. Our platform and products provide the data, scale, and technology capabilities to personalize the content experience, grow audiences, maximize user engagement and monetize content. We empower media partners, enabling them to innovate their user experience by continuously introducing new features, capabilities and technologies that help optimize content delivery through personalized recommendations. We aggregate advertiser demand on behalf of media partners, providing them with critical monetization. Media partners benefit from the combined scale of technology, data and users, which we derive from the large volume of partners and advertisers that use our platform.
Our product suite for media partners, Outbrain Engage, encompasses multiple key technologies, enabling media partners to: 
•Delight users through personalized feeds and data-driven recommendations.  Our platform synthesizes billions of data points, including context, user interests and behaviors to provide customized recommendations to users. Our Smartfeed product is a powerful solution for media partners to personalize content recommendation for users. The modular format of the feed enables media partners to customize the order, layout, and composition of content based on consumers’ context, interests and preferences. Our Smartlogic product dynamically adjusts both the arrangement and the formats of content delivered to a user within Smartfeed depending on the user’s preferences and our media partner key performance indicators (“KPIs”), ensuring a more personalized and engaging feed experience.
•Monetize content through customized, data-driven advertising.  We deliver critical revenue that media partners depend on to operate their business. Our platform and partner integrations support a wide range of ad formats that leverage unique data insights in order to maximize revenue. Our algorithms balance revenue yields with overall user experience and can be harnessed to support additional revenue initiatives. Outbrain typically provides media partners with close to a 100% fill rate of the ad inventory managed by Outbrain; we believe that Outbrain’s role as an end-to-end solution, working directly with both media owners and advertisers, provides an economic advantage for our partners. It is estimated that media owners typically keep 40-50% of ad spend after it has passed through the variety of ad tech and programmatic point solutions, compared to around 70% of spend from Outbrain’s advertisers being passed on to our media partners.
•Maximize user engagement.  Our solution enables media partners to engage and retain their audience, helping them achieve multiple business outcomes such as time spent with their content, growth of digital subscriptions, app downloads, podcast engagement and more. In addition, our proprietary optimization engine is an always-on testing and optimization solution that continuously enhances page layouts for maximum engagement and value.
•Manage their business.  Outbrain Engage provides media partners with a web-based dashboard enabling them to manage and control certain aspects of our platform including the content, formats, sources, frequency and categories of ads delivered on their properties. In addition, we provide precise advertiser and creative classification and filtering tools while strictly enforcing rigorous ad and content quality requirements. We operate at great scale, with hundreds of thousands of new ads uploaded to our platform daily. We have processes and technology to review ads before they go live on Amplify, our product suite for advertisers, either through our automated processes or manually, in a process designed to ensure compliance with our strict content guidelines (which are available publicly on our website). We reject, on average, over 20% of new ads submitted. Our extensive ad review processes and automated monitoring tools provide a further layer of quality control for media partners.
We have thousands of media partner arrangements. We document most of our media partner arrangements using standard contract terms, which are comprised of a partner enrollment form, completed by media partners seeking our services, that hyperlinks to our publicly available standard partner distribution terms. The partner enrollment form contains the commercial terms of our arrangements: term length (initial, auto-renewal and notice period), the specified percentage of the revenue earned from implementing our technology on the media partner pages, the payment terms, as well as any additional terms agreed upon by the parties. The hyperlinked standard partner distribution terms include terms related to the license and use of the platform and technology, limitations on use of similar technologies, and customary terms and conditions. Other media partner arrangements may also include a guaranteed minimum rate of payment if the media partner meets certain additional criteria, including the implementation of advertisements in defined placements.
In addition, certain media partner arrangements may have additional commercial terms such as variable revenue percentages based on page view volume or revenue, access to customized reporting, further detail around use or limitations of similar services, and additional termination rights. We also have arrangements with media partners on a programmatic basis such that the contract defines the mechanics to participate in the media partner’s real-time auction for access to media partner’s inventory, with neither party committing to provide or bid on inventory.
Our Offering for Advertisers
Our platform enables advertisers to have one-on-one interactions with consumers, at scale. We provide advertisers a powerful open web platform with significant reach and exclusive inventory, helping them connect with audiences on premium digital properties. Using Outbrain Amplify, our product suite for advertisers, we enable them to focus their campaigns on the users most likely to engage with their ads. Advertisers log into our platform directly to create campaigns, load or automatically generate creative assets, and manage their advertising activity on the open web, all while optimizing spend toward engagement and ROAS. 
Outbrain Amplify provides advertisers with:
•Seamless and non-intrusive ads.  We provide advertisers access to ad inventory that benefits from high user attention by delivering ads that are native to the user experience and are personalized based on our unique understanding of each user’s context and interests. We call our ads Smartads™ because they are component-based and dynamically match the look and feel of the content where they are placed. Our Smartads support a variety of formats, including text and image, video, interactive carousel, app install and other forms of direct response.
•Ads optimized for engagement.  Our deep and direct integration across the digital properties of thousands of media partners provides us with a wealth of proprietary data pertaining to user engagement and content consumption patterns. This enables us to deliver ads based on our user interest graph, as well as other unique data-driven tools and technologies. We believe that our direct integrations and exclusive partnerships are a differentiator when compared to most other online advertising solutions. Unlike other solutions, which often connect an advertiser to an available ad opportunity in a non-exclusive manner, typically mediated by other third-party platforms and technologies, our platform benefits from direct visibility into users’ overall engagement.
•Results—optimize and pay for performance.  Our platform enables advertisers to optimize to specific campaign goals, and buy on a Cost-per-Click basis, guaranteeing engagement and delivering other measurable business outcomes. We maintain transparent performance metrics, and advertisers are able to view progress, manage ongoing campaigns and maximize ROAS. Our autopilot feature enables advertisers to set their goals and KPIs and allows Amplify to automatically optimize bid prices and budget allocations to hit these goals. Our Conversion Bid Strategy (CBS) product automates and improves the optimization process, allowing advertisers to select varied ROAS or conversion goals while our product automatically optimizes their campaigns to maximize performance towards the desired outcomes. Advertisers and their agencies wishing to transact through programmatic channels can use Zemanta, our programmatic platform, as well as other third-party programmatic platforms.
•Quality.  We work with established media partners, employing rigorous selection criteria, onboarding standards, controls, processes, and ongoing monitoring. As a result, our platform provides predominantly exclusive access to engaged users in high quality content environments across many of the world’s most trusted media properties.
Our Personalized Feed Experience for Users—Smartfeed™
Smartfeed is our personalized feed solution that drives deeper discovery of content, products and services, longer sessions and better user engagement. Smartfeed powers the content feeds of thousands of digital media owners, combining highly engaging multimedia formats, such as text and image, or video, with a diverse range of experiences and dynamic optimizations, continuously improving a personalized user experience.
Within Smartfeed, our Smartlogic product dynamically adjusts both the arrangement and the formats of content delivered to a user, depending on the user’s preferences and our media partner’s KPIs, ensuring a more personalized and engaging feed experience. It leverages machine learning to personalize not just the content, but the entire feed composition from content experiences to the number and format of ads, ordering and more. 
Our Smartfeed technology supports a wide variety of ad creative formats, including: 
Our Strengths
•Mission-critical partner for digital media owners.  We provide digital media partners with mission-critical technology, an “operating system,” that is designed to increase user engagement and content monetization. The capabilities and revenue we provide enable many of our partners to sustain their businesses and deliver quality journalism, in some cases as they continue a long-term transition away from historic reliance on offline ad revenue. We are a trusted partner for some of the world’s most prestigious digital media owners such as Asahi Shimbun, CNN, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, MSN, Sky News and Sky Sports, and The Washington Post. The average tenure of our top 20 media partners, based on our 2021 revenue, is over seven years.
•Unique, at-scale platform for advertisers.  Through our vast and predominantly exclusive relationships with media partners, we provide advertisers with access to over a billion monthly unique users. The breadth of our audience reach enables advertisers to deliver at-scale campaigns and to optimize the performance of their advertising spend.
•Unique proprietary data and algorithms driving a virtuous cycle.  Our direct integrations across our partners’ properties provide us with a large volume of proprietary first-party engagement data, including context, user interest and behavioral signals. Leveraging our data, we continuously optimize our algorithms to improve CTR and ROAS. By delivering better results to advertisers, we are able to grow our business and our platform, which, in turn, helps us collect more data and further enhance our algorithms, driving better results for our partners, helping us further grow our platform and our business.
•Well positioned for a privacy-centric world.   By integrating directly with our media partners’ properties, we generate proprietary first-party data and are able to collect and infer valuable user related data and insights. With the upcoming discontinuation of third-party cookies and confusion about the efficacy of any new approaches, marketers are looking to reinstate their consumer vision. More than three quarters of advertisers claimed ‘robust first-party data’ is important when selecting video partners. In addition, our ability to use unique contextual signals enables us to deliver strong user engagement and advertiser ROAS without the need to rely solely on user-based targeting, typically enabled through user tracking technologies that may not be available in the future.
•History of successful innovation.   We pioneered our category and have been focused on innovation since our founding. To ensure seamless product innovation we operate as a continuous deployment engineering organization, releasing an average of over 300 code deployments daily. We plan to continue investing in our platform and its features.
•Scaled, profitable and diversified business.   We have grown our business rapidly while achieving profitability, demonstrating the power of our technology, the strength of our partner and advertiser relationships and the inherent operating leverage of our model. In 2021, we achieved over $1 billion in revenue, $240.3 million in gross profit, and $272.1 million in Ex-TAC Gross Profit, reflecting year over year growth of 32.4%, 45.6% and 40.0%, respectively. In 2021, net income was $11.0 million, or 4.6% of gross profit, compared to a net income of $4.4 million, or 2.6% of gross profit, in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $88.9 million, or 32.7% of Ex-TAC Gross Profit, in 2021 from $41.1 million, or 21.2% of Ex-TAC Gross Profit, in 2020. Our business is well diversified. In 2021 our top 
twenty digital media partners accounted for approximately 49% of our revenue, with the largest accounting for 11% of our revenue. During the same year, our top twenty advertisers accounted for approximately 23% of our revenue, with the largest accounting for approximately 3% of our revenue. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for definitions and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures, such as Ex-TAC Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Ex-TAC Gross Profit, to the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
•Team and culture.   Companies cannot effect the change they aspire to achieve without passionate, innovative employees. We rely on a global and diverse team of highly capable employees to collaborate, innovate, and execute our vision—to empower high quality journalism and content creation. Outbrain routinely conducts anonymous employee engagement surveys; according to the survey in mid-2021, which had an 86% employee participation rate, 90% of our employees responded that they would recommend Outbrain as a great place to work. 
Our Growth Strategies
We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of digital content consumption and digital advertising. We intend to continue investing in technology and innovation to improve our recommendation engine and product offering, support our efforts to grow relationships with existing and new media partners, and expand our advertiser footprint and share of wallet. We plan to pursue the following growth strategies: 
•Continuously improve user engagement.   Improving the quality of our recommendation engine has been an important driver of past growth and we expect it to remain a key driver of future growth. We believe that a great user experience drives engagement that compounds over time. Continued investment in our technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities drives a better user experience, resulting in better CTR predictions and, in turn, higher monetization yield and revenue. We believe that we can significantly grow our business solely by improving user engagement. 
•Grow our ad inventory. We have an extensive history of growing ad inventory by expanding our media partnerships and forming new ones. 
Existing partners.  We have a strong track record of growth through the continuous expansion of existing media partnerships, as we launched products, features and formats that improved user engagement and retention, grew audiences, and improved monetization. We plan to continue innovating as we seek to grow our ad inventory by implementing optimizations, creating new ad formats, seeking additional ad placements, and pursuing opportunities to manage a larger proportion of our media partners’ digital properties through both direct integrations and programmatic relationships. In addition, we plan to expand our partnerships with software and hardware providers, enabling us to offer personalized content feeds for browsers and mobile operating systems. 
New partners.  We plan to pursue new partnerships with media owners as well as integrations with programmatic platforms that will expand our reach to additional user segments, helping us grow our business. 
•Grow advertiser spend.   We plan to grow spend from existing, as well as new advertisers by pursuing the following initiatives: 
◦Further invest in our advertiser product suite.   In the past, improvements to our advertiser solutions have been a meaningful driver of growth for our business. We plan to continue investing in Amplify and Zemanta in order to deliver better tools and technologies for advertisers on our platform. 
◦Continuously improve ROAS.   We aim to deliver better results for advertisers through improved CTR, as well as automation in pricing and conversion optimization through our Conversion Bid Strategy product, helping us grow existing and new advertisers’ share of wallet. 
◦Grow brand spend.   We plan to expand our existing suite of solutions aimed at brand advertisers. We believe that we will be able to capture significant spend from new and existing advertisers by providing new capabilities, such as additional exclusive ad placements, new optimization solutions, and unique ad formats, amongst others. 
◦Grow the number of advertisers.   In addition to investments in our advertiser product and technology, we plan to invest in sales and marketing initiatives aimed at attracting new advertisers to our platform. We believe Zemanta’s programmatic offerings will continue to gain adoption amongst leading agencies and brands, and that new programmatic demand partners will enable us to continue to expand our advertiser footprint.
◦Drive adoption of high impact ad formats.   High impact ad formats such as video, content highlight reels, and interactive carousel represent a significant opportunity to improve monetization of existing inventory. We plan to expand our offerings and capabilities in order to drive continued adoption by advertisers of these formats, helping them reach more of their target audience and achieve their campaign goals, enabling us to grow our business. The addition of video ad formats to our platform and advertiser offering is evidence of the significant opportunity for growth and has already delivered strong returns. From 2018 to 2021, we grew video revenues from approximately 2% to approximately 8% of our annual revenue. 
On January 5, 2022, we completed the acquisition of video intelligence AG (“vi”), a Swiss-based contextual video technology company for digital media owners. Through our acquisition of vi in the first quarter of 2022, we expanded our video offering to new formats and environments, including In-Stream video ads and connected TV (CTV) environments.
◦Acquisitions and strategic partnerships.   We have a track record of successfully executing a number of acquisitions and partnerships, helping us efficiently expand our offerings, grow our business and grow our talent. In 2017, we acquired Zemanta, providing us with advanced programmatic capabilities. In 2018, we acquired AdNgin, an advanced user interface optimization platform. In January 2022, we acquired vi, providing us with an expanded video offering for advertisers and media owners. We intend to continue pursuing partnership and acquisition opportunities that will enhance our technology or market presence and deliver more value to our partners and advertisers. 
Our Competition
The digital advertising industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete for advertising dollars and media owner partnerships with advertising technology platforms such as Criteo, Magnite, PubMatic, Taboola, The Trade Desk, Viant and Xandr (Microsoft), as well as large consumer-facing digital platforms with advertising technology capabilities, such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Twitter. The key factors that enable us to compete effectively for inventory from digital media owners include:
•the ability to deliver competitive monetization and engagement on media partner properties;
•trust, transparency and long-term alignment; and
•differentiated feed technology.
The key factors that enable us to compete effectively for advertising dollars include: 
•delivering high ROAS through our ability to identify and engage relevant users; 
•massive audience reach; 
•quality of inventory; and
•comprehensive range of inventory types, advertising formats and campaign tools.
Our Technology
We have designed our platform to process real-time content and advertising transactions quickly and efficiently at a massive scale. Our platform delivers on average over 10 billion recommendations daily, in 20 languages. We designed our platform using a microservices-based architecture, which enables the rapid deployment of new features with high availability, reliability, and redundancy.
Our platform consists of the following key technology components:
•Infrastructure.   To support our business needs, we operate our own proprietary cloud infrastructure. Our global infrastructure includes over 7,000 servers, with storage capacity exceeding several petabytes. Our servers are located in three third-party data centers, on a co-location basis, in Secaucus, NJ, Sacramento, CA, and Chicago, IL. Each of our data centers is operated by a different vendor, in order to minimize the impact of any outage on our platform. While all three data centers actively serve recommendations to users, we are able to serve all of our traffic from two of the three data centers if needed. We utilize a global content delivery network (CDN), and dynamic acceleration, for additional performance optimization and redundancy.
Our infrastructure is designed such that we do not have any known single point of failure at any level. Within each data center, we have load-balanced servers on each layer of the system, so that a failure in one server or component will not impact performance or availability. Some of these clusters are dedicated to handling incoming traffic and delivering content, including web servers, caches and real-time database applications. Other clusters are devoted to the data analytics and algorithm modeling involved in creating content recommendations. The design also includes load balancers, firewalls and routers that connect the components and provide connections to the Internet. In particular, we use software specifically designed for processing large data sets to provide real-time data analysis, the results of which are then fed back to refresh and improve our recommendation algorithms. 
We monitor our system using several tools, both internal and external, to gauge our uptime and performance. We also use multiple layered security controls to protect our recommendation engine and our data assets, including software-based access controls for our source code and production systems, segregated networks for different components of our production systems and centralized production systems management. We believe that the failure of any individual component will not affect the overall availability of our platform, having maintained an uptime of 99.9% from 2018 to 2021.
•Data.   One of the key benefits of our platform is the management, analysis, and structuring of valuable user engagement and advertising data. 
◦Our data scale:   We gather billions of data events per minute delivering over 10 billion recommendations per day. On average, we collect in excess of 80 terabytes of data per day consisting of contextual signals, advertiser data, and user engagement data (typically clicks on recommendations). We leverage our data to improve our algorithms and prediction capabilities.
◦Our automated content index:   To operate our platform, we have created our automated content index, comprising over 2 billion content elements. Our technology automatically classifies and analyzes content at a rate of over 1,500,000 pages a day in 20 different languages. We index content through RSS feeds and JavaScript triggers to continuously identify new content and changes to existing content. Our automated index deconstructs content into base elements including titles, images and topics in order to recombine the elements into targeting data and formatted recommendations and ads.
•Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.   Our proprietary artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities enable us to harness the vast volume of data we collect in order to effectively match users to relevant content and ads based on our content index. Our algorithms make over 1,000 click predictions, on average, before selecting which recommendations to present on each page view. 
Our Data Flywheel
Sales and Marketing
We focus our sales and marketing efforts on supporting, advising, and training our partners and advertisers, helping them optimize their use of our platform. We employ in-market sales teams across our markets, helping us attract premium digital media owners and advertisers to our platform. In addition, we have developed and currently utilize online acquisition channels to attract new advertisers, who we are able to onboard and serve in an automated manner, using self-serve tools and technologies. 
Our sales teams educate prospective media owners, partners, and advertisers on the use, technical capabilities, and benefits of our platform. Our dedicated teams work with potential customers through the entire sale cycle, from initial contact to contract execution and implementation. Throughout the process, our teams provide guidance as to how our platform can optimize the value of a media partner’s audience or how an advertiser can reach relevant users. Additionally, following contract execution and implementation, our account management teams guide media partners on how additional platform deployment and optimizations can deliver incremental monetization. We engage advertisers and their agencies in order to educate them on how to increase reach and ROAS using our solutions. 
Our marketing team is focused on delivering strategies that drive efficient new partner and advertiser acquisition, enhancing our position as key industry thought leaders, supporting our sales teams, and increasing awareness of our brand.
Human Capital Resources
Much of our success can be directly attributed to our global team of technology, business, and data science experts who work out of our 17 locations worldwide. Outbrain comprises a diverse, intelligent and driven group of individuals who are passionate and excited to be leading the way in which users discover things online. 
Our culture and team are the most important asset in building and expanding our business. Our team identifies new problems to solve, builds solutions, optimizes and extends our infrastructure, and acquires and serves customers. We believe that strong and diverse teams deepen customer relationships, promote innovation, and increase productivity. Our Culture Manifesto, available publicly on the Outbrain website, is one of many important expressions of the values and principles that reflect how we behave, collectively and individually. 
Our people strategy revolves around creating employee experiences. We strive to foster deep employee engagement built upon personal development and achievement that is supported by continuous feedback, learning, and team building. As we continue growing our team, and become more diverse culturally and geographically, we want to make sure we retain a shared mission among the people that become part of our company. In particular, there are certain characteristics that we seek out in our employees:
•Intelligent and productive.   There are many great attributes companies can seek in the candidates they hire—academic degrees, deep industry expertise, hands-on work experience, etc. While these attributes are an important part of our screening process, we seek, above all else, a combination of smarts and a “get stuff done” attitude.
•Collaborative.   We love hiring and nurturing professionals who are great at their craft. At the same time, we are cognizant that we are ultimately playing a team sport and we therefore look for people who strive to be amazing team players. A self-described “Superstar” or “Ninja” focused on personal status is not likely to fit our team, even if they might be very good at their profession.
•Passionate.   People who have a passion for something typically have that spark in their eyes when they engage in the work they love. They bring their best self to work, possess the desire to improve and learn, and focus on opportunities rather than obstacles. Through their passion, they set the tone for the rest of the team and become excellent examples for everyone to follow.
We also strive to make Outbrain diverse at all levels of the company, and in all types of jobs. Our priority is to always hire and promote people based on qualifications and merit, and we believe that this approach does not conflict with the objectives of inclusion and empowerment. Our team consists of people from many different nationalities and cultures with different perspectives, opinions and ideas which we believe is undeniably powerful and ultimately drives shareholder value. We support employee-led employee resource groups ("ERGs"), which foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. We currently have four ERGs: OB Good, OB Green, OB WE and OB4Equality, focusing on social responsibility, environmental sustainability, women's empowerment, and diversity equity and inclusion, respectively, all of which are open to people of all backgrounds.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,016 employees and contractors, 53% of whom were male and 47% of whom were female. 43.3% of our workforce is located in Israel, 15.5% is located in the United States, and the remaining 41.2% is located in our other global offices. In March 2020, we transitioned to remote work, with selective offices returning on a hybrid basis where conditions related to Covid-19 permitted. Based on feedback from the organization, we plan to continue working based on a hybrid model, with employees working from both our office locations and their homes.
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal and state statutory and common law rights, foreign laws where applicable, and contractual restrictions. We seek to control access to our proprietary technology by entering into non-disclosure agreements with third parties and disclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors. 
We consider our trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights to be, in the aggregate, material to our business. In addition to our intellectual property rights, we also consider the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions to be contributors to our success. We believe our platform would be difficult, time consuming, and costly to replicate. We protect our competitive technology position through innovation and by continually developing new intellectual property. 
Outbrain has built an extensive intellectual property portfolio to date. This portfolio includes 18 granted U.S. utility patents, 35 granted U.S. design patents and 14 European registered community designs. 
Regulatory Environment
We are subject to privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and sharing of consumer data. Interest-based advertising, or the use of data to draw inferences about a consumer’s interests and deliver relevant advertising to that consumer, has come under increasing scrutiny by legislative bodies, regulatory bodies, self-regulatory bodies, privacy advocates, and academics in the United States and abroad. In particular, much of this scrutiny has focused on the use of cookies and other tracking technologies that collect or aggregate information regarding consumers’ online browsing and mobile app activity. Our Company, our media partners and advertisers rely upon large volumes of such data collected primarily through cookies and other tracking technologies. It is essential that we monitor legal requirements and other developments in this area, both domestically and globally, maintain a robust privacy and security compliance program, anticipate the evolution of regulations applicable to us and engage in responsible privacy practices, including providing consumers with notice of the types of data we collect, how we collect it, with whom we share it, how we use that data to provide our solutions and how consumers can exercise their rights and personalization choices. We typically collect IP addresses and device identifiers that are considered to be personal data or personal information under the privacy laws of some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of current or future data privacy legislation or regulation. The definition of personally identifiable information, personal information, or personal data varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve in ways that may require us to adapt our practices to comply with laws and regulations related to the collection, storage, use, and sharing of consumer data. As a result, our technology platform and business practices must be assessed regularly against a continuously evolving legal, regulatory, and technology landscape.
A growing set of privacy regulations have introduced complexity regarding the collection, use, and transmission of consumer data to the digital advertising ecosystem. We have implemented a number of technology innovations, process enhancements, and industry solutions in response to increased obligations, including adopting the advertising industry’s technical and policy solutions that form compliance standards. 
Additionally, compliance with our privacy policy, privacy notices and our general consumer data privacy and security practices are subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission, which may bring enforcement actions to challenge allegedly unfair and deceptive trade practices, including the violation of privacy policies and misrepresentations or material omissions therein.
Certain State Attorneys General in the United States may also bring enforcement actions based on applicable state laws or federal laws that permit state-level enforcement. California enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, along with related regulations (together, the “CCPA”), which became effective in 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California residents and increases the privacy and security obligations of businesses handling personal data. The CCPA is enforceable by the California Attorney General and there is also a private right of action relating to certain data security incidents. The CCPA generally requires covered businesses to, among other things, provide disclosures to California consumers and afford California consumers the ability to opt-out of the sharing of personal data between parties, a concept that is defined 
broadly, and behavioral advertising triggers such requirements under the CCPA. The CCPA or subsequent guidance on our business or operations may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Decreased availability and increased costs of information could adversely affect our ability to meet our advertisers’ requirements and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, starting in January 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which was voted into law in November 2020 and amends the CCPA, imposes additional data protection obligations on certain businesses doing business in California, including abiding by additional consumer rights and limiting the use and processing of personal data including sensitive data. In addition, the CPRA explicitly requires businesses to provide consumers with the right to opt-out of sharing of personal data with third parties for behavioral advertising. Accordingly, the CPRA could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The CCPA has led to “copycat” laws in other states across the country, such as in Virginia and Colorado, and likely in Connecticut, Florida, New York, Oklahoma, and Washington. This legislation may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions, and potential legal risk, require additional investment in resources to compliance programs, and could impact strategies and availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. Such new privacy laws add additional complexity, requirements, restrictions, and potential legal risk, require additional investment in resources such as compliance programs, and could impact trading strategies and availability of previously useful data.
Outside of the United States, our privacy and data practices are subject to regulation by data protection authorities and other regulators in the countries in which we do business. The use and transfer of personal data in member states of the European Union is currently governed under the GDPR, which grants additional data protection rights to consumers, such as deletion and portability, and generally prohibits the transfer of personal data of EU subjects outside of the EU, unless the party exporting the data from the EU implements a compliance mechanism designed to ensure that the receiving party will adequately protect such data. The GDPR establishes significant potential liabilities for certain data protection violations, which may result in fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of an enterprise’s global annual revenue. Despite GDPR purportedly harmonizing data protection laws across the European Union, continuously evolving interpretation and enforcement by member states requires regular review of the legal and regulatory landscape. The United Kingdom, previously part of the European Union and subject to the GDPR, may also amend its data protection regime, which could add more complexity to the regulatory landscape and our operations in Europe.
We previously relied upon the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework (the “Privacy Shield framework”) to transfer personal data of EU subjects to the United States. The Privacy Shield framework was declared invalid by the CJEU on July 16, 2020. In the same judgment, the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses, a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and a potential alternative to the Privacy Shield framework, both of which were used by Outbrain, but it made clear that reliance on the standard contractual clauses alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and cast doubt on their future use. The use of standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data specifically to the United States remains under review by a number of European data protection supervisory authorities.
Furthermore, the EU is currently in discussions to replace the ePrivacy Directive (commonly called the “Cookie Directive”) with the ePrivacy Regulation that governs the use of technologies that collect, access, and store consumer information and may create additional compliance burdens for us in Europe.
Further, other jurisdictions have proposed or enacted legislation that closely track the concepts, obligations, and consumer rights described in the GDPR, including Brazil’s General Data Protection Law, the Japanese APPI and Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act 2020. The laws that have passed are being enforced by local authorities. The enactment of new proposed laws is gaining momentum and adds additional complexity to our and our partners’ compliance programs.
Beyond laws and regulations, we are also members of self-regulatory bodies that impose additional requirements related to the collection, use, and disclosure of consumer data. We are members in good standing of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), an association dedicated to responsible data collection and its use for digital advertising. We adhere to the NAI Code of Conduct for Web and Mobile, along with the IAB Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, and the IAB Europe OBA Framework. We are also Trustworthy Accountability Group (“TAG”) Brand Safety Certified. We are participants of, and adhere to, the Self-Regulatory Principles set forth by the Digital Advertising Alliance and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance.
Under the requirements of these self-regulatory bodies, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice via our privacy policies about our use of cookies and other tracking technologies to collect consumer data, our use of consumer data to deliver interest-based ads, and consumers’ opt-out choices. We also allow consumers to opt-out from the use of data we collect for purposes of interest-based advertising through mechanisms described in our privacy policies available on our website. Some of these self-regulatory bodies have the ability to review or sanction members or participants, which could result in penalties and cause reputational harm. Additionally, some of these bodies might refer violations of their requirements to the Federal Trade Commission or other regulators.
For additional information regarding the current regulatory environment and how it may impact us, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” under “Risks Relating to Legal or Regulatory Matters” included in this Report.
Security
Being a trusted partner is a key value for us and, as such, cyber security is an ongoing commitment. Our dedicated cyber security team has implemented industry best practices and standards including, but not limited to, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27032, Cloud Security Alliance Star level 1, and PCI-DSS SAQ A-EP, SOC 2 data centers. 
Our products are designed with security and privacy at the forefront. We maintain tight controls over the personal data we collect, retaining it in firewalled and secured databases with strictly limited and controlled access rights, to ensure it is secure while utilizing advanced monitoring over our environment. All traffic to and between our data centers is encrypted, along with all sensitive configurations, while our users and customers have their passwords hashed. 
Secure advertising is a building block of user trust. In order to provide secure ads, we integrated an advanced industry leading third-party technology to scan live ads looking for potential security violations either in the ads themselves or on the pages to which they directly link. Combined with internally developed capabilities and our content review process we are tackling both malicious ads and the bad actors behind them. 
We constantly strive to understand what we have yet to discover by running an exhaustive security testing framework, including scanning all internal and external assets for vulnerabilities, utilizing multiple third-party security testing teams every year, and running a bug bounty program with more than 300 security researchers. 
Providing a clean, non-fraudulent premium network for publishers, advertisers and consumers is a top priority at Outbrain. Our dedicated anti-fraud team monitors our platform to identify and investigate unusual web traffic patterns. We detect, block and prevent fraudulent web traffic by using both internal and external third-party TAG Anti-Fraud certified solutions. We have been a TAG-verified member since 2018. We are also adopting the Media Rating Council Invalid Traffic Detection and Filtration Standards in our internal fraud detection technological ecosystem.
