OVERVIEW
We are a late stage development biopharmaceutical company, with ongoing registration directed trials, committed to advancing new medicines for patients battling cancer. Our pipeline is focused on novel anticancer agents that inhibit critical signaling pathways in cancer that promote cancer cell survival and tumor growth, particularly RAF/MEK inhibition and FAK inhibition.
Our most advanced product candidates, VS-6766 and defactinib, are being investigated in both preclinical and clinical studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including, low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer, uveal melanoma, and endometrial cancer. We believe that VS-6766 may be beneficial as a therapeutic as a single agent or when used together in combination with defactinib, other agents, other pathway inhibitors or other current and emerging standard of care treatments in cancers that do not adequately respond to currently available therapies.
VS-6766 is an orally available first-in-class unique small molecule RAF/MEK clamp. In contrast to other MEK inhibitors commercially available and in development, VS-6766 is a dual RAF/MEK clamp that blocks both MEK kinase activity and the ability of RAF to phosphorylate MEK. MEK-only inhibitors (e.g. PD0325901) paradoxically induce MEK phosphorylation (pMEK) by relieving extracellular-signal-regulated-kinase (ERK)-dependent feedback inhibition of RAF which may limit their efficacy. By inhibiting RAF-mediated phosphorylation of MEK, VS-6766 has the advantage of not inducing pMEK. This unique mechanism of VS-6766 enables more effective inhibition of ERK signaling and may confer enhanced therapeutic activity against ERK-dependent, RAS or BRAF mutant tumors.
VS-6766 has been shown to inhibit signaling and proliferation of tumor cell lines with a variety of mitogen-activated pathway kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations including Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (HRAS), or B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutations, among others. VS-6766 has also been shown to synergize with agents targeting the MAPK pathway including G12C inhibitors in KRAS mutant NSCLC and CRC in preclinical models and enhances the anti-tumor effects of anti-PD-1 in KRAS mutant NSCLC mouse models. VS-6766 has shown compelling synergy with defactinib in preclinical models. 
Defactinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of FAK and proline-rich tyrosine kinase (PYK2) that is currently being evaluated as a potential combination therapy for various solid tumors. FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the protein tyrosine kinase-2 (PTK-2) gene that is involved in cellular adhesion and, in cancer, metastatic capability. Defactinib targets malignant cells both directly and through modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Defactinib has received orphan drug designation in ovarian cancer in the United States, the European Union, and Australia. Preclinical research by our scientists and collaborators at world-renowned research institutions has described the effect of FAK inhibition as enhancing immune response by decreasing immuno-suppressive cells, increasing cytotoxic T cells, and reducing stromal density, which allows tumor-killing immune cells to enter the tumor. 
The combination of VS-6766 and defactinib has been found to be clinically active in patients with KRAS mutant tumors and received breakthrough designation from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of all patients with recurrent LGSOC, regardless of KRAS status after one or more prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy.
In an ongoing investigator-initiated Phase 1/2 study (the FRAME study), the combination of VS-6766 and defactinib is being evaluated in patients with recurrent LGSOC, KRAS mutant NSCLC, KRAS-G12V mutant NSCLC, CRC, pancreatic cancer, and KRAS mutant endometrial cancer. Based on the LGSOC and KRAS-G12V

NSCLC cohorts of the FRAME study, we have initiated our registration directed trials entitled RAF and MEK Program (RAMP) 201 and 202 discussed in further detail below. 
Updated data from the FRAME study presented at the European Society of Medicine Congress in September 2021, demonstrated an ORR of 46% (11 of 24) among the evaluable patients with LGSOC (n=24). Among the patients with KRAS mutant LGSOC (n=11), the ORR was 64% (7 of 11). Among the patients with KRAS wild type LGSOC (n=9), the ORR was 44% (4 of 9). Of the evaluable patients, 10 (42%) received previous MEK inhibitor therapy. The median progression-free survival across all patients was 23.0 months (95% CI: 10.6- not reached). As of the April 2021 data cutoff date, 13 of 24 patients (54%) remained on study.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we commenced registration-directed trials investigating VS-6766 as a monotherapy and in combination with defactinib. The registration-directed trials are entitled RAMP 201 and 202. RAMP 201 is an adaptive two-part multicenter, parallel cohort, randomized, open label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VS-6766 alone and in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC. RAMP 202 study is a Phase 2, adaptive two-part multicenter, parallel cohort, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VS-6766 alone and in combination with defactinib in patients with KRAS G12V mutant NSCLC, following treatment with a platinum-based regimen and immune checkpoint inhibitor. Additionally, the combination of VS-6766 with defactinib is being evaluated in several exploratory cohorts including KRAS non-G12V and BRAF (V600E and non-V600E) mutant NSCLC. Based on preclinical rationale, we have added BRAF mutant cohorts (V600E and non-V600E) to the RAMP 202 study in order to efficiently evaluate VS-6766 with defactinib in BRAF-mutant NSCLC. Both studies are discussed in greater detail below. 
In September 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Amgen, Inc. (Amgen) to evaluate the combination of VS-6766 with Amgen’s KRAS-G12C inhibitor LUMAKRASTM (sotorasib) in a Phase 1/2 trial entitled RAMP 203. The Phase 1/2 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of VS-6766 in combination with LUMAKRASTM in patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC who have not been previously treated with a KRAS G12C inhibitor, as well as in patients who have progressed on a KRAS-G12C inhibitor. The study will therefore investigate the potential benefits of a more complete vertical blockade of the RAS pathway with the combination of VS-6766 with LUMAKRASTM (G12C inhibition) in KRAS G12C-mutant locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
In November 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. (Mirati) to evaluate the combination of Mirati’s investigational KRAS-G12C inhibitor adagrasib with VS-6766 in KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC. The primary objective of this multi-center, single-arm, open-label Phase 1/2 trial entitled RAMP 204 is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose for the combination of adagrasib and VS-6766 in patients with KRAS-G12C mutant NSCLC. The study will also investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the combination in patients who have progressed on a KRAS-G12C inhibitor. The trial will build on preclinical data showing a deeper blockade of ERK pathway signaling resulting in enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with the combination of adagrasib and VS-6766 relative to either agent alone.
In addition, VS-6766 and defactinib are currently being investigated in combination with immunotherapeutic and other agents through investigator sponsored trials (ISTs).

OUR FOCUS
We are focused on the development and commercialization of anticancer kinase inhibitors for optimized efficacy and safety – primarily as orally available drugs and drug candidates that are designed to treat various forms of cancer. Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. The American Cancer Society estimated that in the United States in 2021, almost 1.9 million new cases of cancer were diagnosed and more than 600,000 people died from the disease. Current treatments for cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, cell therapy, and targeted therapy. Notwithstanding years of intensive research and clinical use, these current treatments often fail to cure cancer. For example, conventional chemotherapy works by stopping tumor growth by disrupting the cell cycle leading to cell death. Chemotherapies are effective at killing cancer cells because cancer cells generally grow more rapidly than normal cells. However, chemotherapies also target fast-growing normal cells of the body, such as blood cells, hair follicles, and the cells lining the mouth, stomach, and intestines. As a result, they have a range of side effects and although the treatments may succeed at initially decreasing tumor burden, they ultimately fail to kill all the cancer cells and/or to effectively disrupt the tumor microenvironment (TME), potentially resulting in eventual disease progression.
Accordingly, cancer remains one of the world’s most serious health problems and is the second most common cause of death in the United States after heart disease. For example, the U.S. annual incidence, based on 2021 estimates from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (NCI; SEER), is that during the year there were approximately, 21,410 new cases of ovarian cancer, 235,760 new cases of lung cancer, 149,500 new cases of colorectal cancer, and 60,430 new cases of pancreatic cancer. 
With the application of new technologies and key discoveries, we believe that we are now entering an era of cancer research characterized by a more sophisticated understanding of the biology of cancer. We believe that the potential of oral, targeted therapies, along with the rapidly advancing field of immunotherapy, or using the body’s immune system to fight cancer, present the opportunity to develop more effective cancer treatments.
We leverage our expertise in translational research and deep understanding of cancer treatment pathways as well as strategic partnerships to identify, develop and deliver effective options to address unmet needs. We believe the best way for us to help patients living with cancer is by advancing newly emerging mechanisms of the disease and developing novel therapies that target these mechanisms.
Despite significant advances in the treatment of cancer, unmet needs persist. RAS has long been one of the most elusive cancer-causing proteins. RAS mutant tumors are present in about 30% of all human cancers, have historically presented a difficult treatment challenge, and are often associated with significantly worse prognosis. Since the discovery of RAS almost four decades ago, researchers have persistently tried, and failed, to develop therapies that effectively block the cancer-promoting effects of RAS mutation, including KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and HRAS mutations. Challenges associated with identifying new treatment options for these types of cancers include resistance to single agents, identifying tolerable combination regimens with MEK inhibitors, and new RAS inhibitors in development addressing only a minority of all RAS mutated cancers.
Our focus is targeting cancer cells both directly as well as indirectly by way of the tumor microenvironment.
Low Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (LGSOC)
LGSOC is a slow-growing cancer with a high mortality rate. It is estimated that 70% of LGSOC tumors are driven by mutations in the RAS pathway, including an estimated 30% of those that are KRAS mutant. The remaining KRAS wild-type patients include those with mutations in NRAS, or BRAF. There are an estimated 6,000 patients in the United States and 80,000 worldwide living with this disease. Approximately half of those diagnosed are in their 20s-40s. LGSOC has a median survival rate of 10 years, with 85% of patients experiencing recurrence and enduring severe pain and complications as the disease progresses. Despite low response rates to chemotherapy, it continues to be the standard of care for this disease. Most prior research has focused on high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). However, LGSOC is clinically histologically and molecularly unique from HGSOC with limited treatments available.

Currently, VS-6766 is being evaluated (i) in combination with defactinib and as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with recurrent LGSOC in a Phase 2 registration directed study entitled RAMP 201 and (ii) in combination with defactinib for patients with advanced LGSOC in the FRAME study.



Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and worldwide. Approximately 15% of lung cancers are small cell lung cancer, approximately 55% are adenocarcinomas, approximately 20% are squamous carcinomas, and about 5% are large cell carcinomas with the remainder being mixed or rare histologies. Approximately 80-85% of lung cancers are NSCLCs, comprising of adenocarcinomas, squamous carcinomas, and large cell carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas most frequently (>50%) have molecular alterations that can be targeted with oral therapies. The most frequent molecular alterations are mutations in the KRAS gene (about 25% of adenocarcinomas) of which KRAS G12c is most common (14%) and G12V second most frequent (7%). Studies suggest that these types of KRAS mutations differ in clinical characteristics and response to traditional treatments such as chemotherapy. Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors are in development for KRAS G12c mutations of which sotorasib is currently approved. There are no drugs other than VS-6766 being developed for G12V mutations. Sotorasib has relatively low response rates and short times to progression so a number of agents are being combined with the G12C inhibitors including VS-6766. BRAF mutations occur in 2-3 % of lung adenocarcinomas and activate similar downstream pathways including RAF and MEK as KRAS mutations. 
Currently, there is a high unmet need in the second-line treatment of KRAS and BRAF mutant NSCLC as evidenced by the low response rates and short survival times. Currently, VS-6766 is being evaluated (i) in combination with defactinib and as a monotherapy for treatment of patients with recurrent KRAS G12V mutant NSCLC in a registration directed study entitled RAMP 202, (ii) in combination with defactinib for the treatment of patients with a recurrent non-G12V KRAS mutant and BRAF mutant NSCLC in a signal finding cohort of RAMP 202, (iii) in combination with defactinib for the treatment of patients with advanced KRAS mutant NSCLC and advanced KRAS G12V mutant NSCLC in the FRAME study, and (iv) in combination with everolimus for treatment of patients with NSCLC in an IST. In addition, in September 2021 we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement to evaluate VS-6766 in combination with Amgen’s KRAS-G12C inhibitor LUMAKRASTM (sotorasib) in a Phase 1/2 trial in patients with KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC entitled RAMP 203 and in November 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement to evaluate VS-6766 in combination with Mirati’s investigation KRAS G12C inhibitor adagrasib in a Phase 1/2 trial in patients with KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC entitled RAMP 204.
Colorectal Cancer (CRC)
CRC, also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). One in 23 men and one in 25 women will be diagnosed with CRC in their lifetime. CRC is the second leading cause of cancer death among men and women combined in the United States. The NCI estimates that the number of new incidences of CRC was 37.8 per 100,000 men and women per year based on 2014-2018 cases and the five-year relative survival rate from 2011 to 2017 for patients with CRC was approximately 65%. The individual likelihood of survival depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person's overall health. 
Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery, while cancer that has spread widely is usually not curable, with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms. Currently, VS-6766 is being evaluated in combination with defactinib for the treatment of patients with advanced CRC in the FRAME study.
Pancreatic Cancer
In 2021, the NCI estimated that pancreatic cancer was the eleventh most common cancer diagnosed in the United States and that the disease represented the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the country. Pancreatic cancer often has a poor prognosis, even when diagnosed early. Pancreatic cancer typically spreads rapidly and is seldom detected in its early stages, which is a major reason why it is a leading cause of cancer death. Signs and symptoms may not appear until pancreatic cancer is so advanced that complete surgical removal is not possible. 

7




Pancreatic cancer is one of the few cancers where survival has not improved significantly during the past 40 years. The NCI estimates that the number of new incidences of pancreatic cancer was 13.2 per 100,000 men and women per year based on 2014-2018 cases. Pancreatic cancer has a very high mortality rate with approximately 89% of patients dying within five years of their initial diagnosis based on the five-year relative survival rate from 2011 to 2017. The median age for diagnosis is 70 with the disease affecting males slightly more than females. KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer represents approximately 98% of pancreatic cancer diagnoses. 
The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is extremely poor as shown by the survival rate, which indicates the need for new treatments. Chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus radiation is offered to patients whose tumors are unable to be removed surgically. Immuno-oncology agents have not demonstrated a significant improvement in treatment outcome for patients with pancreatic cancer. The limited impact of chemotherapies and immunotherapies to improve the outcome may be due to the dense stroma that is prevalent in pancreatic tumors and the TME. Currently, VS-6766 is being evaluated in combination with defactinib for the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in the FRAME study.
Uveal Melanoma
Uveal melanoma, also known as ocular melanoma, is the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults. It is a disease in which cancer (malignant) cells are found in part of the eye called the uvea. The uvea includes the iris, the ciliary body, and the choroid layer. The iris opens and closes to change the amount of light entering the eye. The ciliary body changes the shape of the lens inside the eye to allow the eye to focus. The choroid layer is next to the retina, the part of the eye that makes a picture. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2021, there were an estimated 3,320 new cases of eye cancer (mainly melanoma) in the United States and the five year survival rate for eye melanoma is approximately 81% based on patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2016. Uveal melanoma has a peak rate of diagnosis around 70 years old.
Uveal melanoma may have no early signs or symptoms, and it is sometimes found during eye exams. As the tumor grows symptoms may include blurred vision, spots that drift in field of vision or flashes of lights, dark spot on the iris, change in the size or change or pupil or a change in position of the eyeball in eye socket. Uveal melanoma has a high risk of migrating from the eye to other sites in the body, and, therefore, treatment is aggressive to try to prevent its spread. Oncologists may initially try watchful waiting if the tumor shows no sign of growing or if the cancer is in the only eye with useful treatment. When treatment is required, surgery is the most common approach for uveal melanoma. Other treatments include radiation therapy, photocoagulation, also known as light coagulation, and thermotherapy. Currently, VS-6766 is being evaluated in combination with defactinib for the treatment of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in an IST.
Endometrial Cancer
Endometrial cancer, also known as uterine cancer, is a cancer of the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus. The uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ in a woman’s pelvis in which a fetus grows after conception. It is the most common type of cancer that affects the female reproductive organs. Endometrial cancer mainly affects women after menopause, with a median age of diagnosis of 63. The NCI estimates that the number of new incidences of uterine cancer was 28.1 per 100,000 women per year based on 2014-2018 cases and that the five-year relative survival rate from 2011 to 2017 for patients with endometrial cancer was approximately 81%. KRAS mutant endometrial cancer represents approximately 21% of endometrial cancer diagnoses.
The current treatment of endometrial cancer depends on the stage and the specific pathology type of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Surgery is generally considered for this disease. In early stages, minimal invasive surgery may be the only treatment required. In later stages, more involved and extensive surgeries to remove the disease outside the uterus and cervix may be required, in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Currently VS-6766 is being evaluated in combination with defactinib for the treatment of patients with KRAS mutant endometrial cancer in the FRAME study.

OUR STRATEGY
With VS-6766 and defactinib, we seek to utilize a multi-faceted approach to treat cancer by directly targeting the cancer cells, enhancing anti-tumor immunity, and modulating the local tumor microenvironment. Our goal is to build a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel drugs that use a multi-faceted approach to improving outcomes for patients with cancer. 
Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

● | Establishing VS-6766 as the backbone therapy for RAS pathway-driven tumors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assessing synergy of VS-6766 with other agents in preclinical models to prioritize for clinical development. It is becoming well established that blockade of multiple nodes in the ERK pathway is necessary for maximal depth and duration of anti-tumor response. We are assessing combinations of VS-6766 with other key agents targeting both the vertical RAS pathway (e.g., KRAS G12C and SHP2 inhibitors), as well as agents targeting parallel pathways (e.g., mTOR inhibitors). These studies may lead to discussions with other companies and clinical investigators with the objective of assessing high priority combinations in the clinic.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing to develop and explore VS-6766 alone and in combination with defactinib and execute on the registration-directed studies RAMP 201 and RAMP 202. RAMP 201 is investigating VS-6766 as monotherapy and in combination with defactinib for treatment of patients with LGSOC and RAMP 202 is investigating VS-6766 as a monotherapy and in combination with defactinib for treatment of patients with KRAS and BRAF mutant NSCLC. VS-6766 is also being investigated in combination with defactinib in an IST entitled FRAME in patients with recurrent LGSOC, KRAS mutant NSCLC, KRAS-G12V mutant NSCLC, CRC, pancreatic cancer, and KRAS mutant endometrial cancer. Furthermore, VS-6766 is being investigated in combination with defactinib for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding the indications in which VS-6766 may be used alone and in combination with other agents. We have entered into clinical collaboration agreements with both Amgen and Mirati to evaluate VS-6766 in combination with Amgen’s G12C inhibitor LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) in a trial entitled RAMP 203 and Mirati’s G12C inhibitor adagrasib in patients with KRAS G12C NSCLC in a trial entitled RAMP 204. Furthermore, VS-6766 is being investigated in combination with everolimus for patients with KRAS mutant NSCLC in an IST. Additionally, preclinical studies are in progress to prioritize additional cancer indications and approaches to expand the potential clinical development of our product candidates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Considering the acquisition or in-licensing of rights to additional agents. We may pursue the acquisition or in-license of rights to additional agents from third parties that may supplement our internal programs and allow us to initiate clinical development of a diverse pipeline of agents more quickly.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may seek third-party collaborators for the eventual commercialization of our product candidates both in the U.S and around the world.

The status of our development programs in the table above represents the ongoing phase of development and does not correspond to the completion of a particular phase. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status, timing, and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect our drug development efforts are discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
VS-6766 and defactinib
VS-6766 is an investigational oral first-in-class unique small molecule RAF/MEK clamp. In contrast to other MEK inhibitors commercially available and in development, VS-6766 is a dual RAF/MEK clamp that blocks both MEK kinase activity and the ability of RAF to phosphorylate MEK. MEK-only inhibitors (e.g., PD0325901) paradoxically induce MEK phosphorylation (pMEK) by relieving extracellular-signal-regulated-kinase (ERK)-dependent feedback inhibition of RAF which may limit their efficacy. By inhibiting RAF-mediated phosphorylation of MEK, VS-6766 has the advantage of not inducing pMEK. This unique mechanism of VS-6766 enables more effective inhibition of ERK signaling and may confer enhanced therapeutic activity against ERK-dependent, RAS, or BRAF mutant tumors.
Defactinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of FAK and proline-rich tyrosine kinase (PYK2) that is currently being evaluated as a potential combination therapy for various solid tumors. FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the protein tyrosine kinase-2 (PTK-2) gene that is involved in cellular adhesion and, in cancer, metastatic capability. Defactinib targets malignant cells both directly and through modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Defactinib has received orphan drug designation in ovarian cancer in the United States, European Union, and Australia. Preclinical research by our scientists and collaborators at world-renowned research

institutions has described the effect of FAK inhibition to enhance immune response by decreasing immuno-suppressive cells, increasing cytotoxic T cells, and reducing stromal density, which allows tumor-killing immune cells to enter the tumor. 
The combination of VS-6766 and defactinib has received breakthrough designation from the FDA for the treatment of all patients with recurrent LGSOC, regardless of KRAS status after one or more prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy.
VS-6766 and defactinib are clinically active against RAS mutant cancers.
Phase 1/2 Study (FRAME) investigating the Combination of VS-6766 and Defactinib in Patients with KRAS Mutant Cancers and Subsequent Analyses
The FRAME study is an open-label, investigator-initiated study that is designed to assess safety, dose response and preliminary efficacy of the VS-6766/defactinib combination in patients with KRAS mutant solid tumors, including LGSOC (including KRAS wild type), KRAS mutant NSCLC, KRAS G12V mutant NSCLC, CRC, pancreatic cancer, and KRAS mutant endometrial cancer. The FRAME study is being led by Dr. Udai Banerji and is being conducted in the United Kingdom. In this study, VS-6766 was administered using a twice-weekly dose escalation schedule and was administered three out of every four weeks. Defactinib was administered using a twice-daily dose escalation schedule, also three out of every four weeks. Dose levels were assessed in three cohorts: cohort 1 (VS-6766 3.2mg, defactinib 200mg); cohort 2a (VS-6766 4mg, defactinib 200mg); and cohort 2b (VS-6766 3.2mg, defactinib 400mg). The recommended Phase 2 dose was determined to be VS-6766 3.2mg, defactinib 200mg.
Updated Phase 1/2 FRAME Study Results in Patients with LGSOC (September 2021)
At the September 2021 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, updated data from the LGSOC cohort of the ongoing, investigatory sponsored Phase 1/2 FRAME study were presented. The results showed encouraging response rates and progression-free survival (PFS).
Among the evaluable patients with LGSOC (n=24), the overall response rate (ORR) was 46% (11 of 24). Among the patients with KRAS mutant LGSOC (n=11), the ORR was 64% (7 of 11). Among the patients with KRAS wild type LGSOC (n=9), the ORR was 44% (4 of 9). Of the evaluable patients, 10 (42%) received previous MEK inhibitor therapy.
The estimated median PFS (mPFS) across all patients was 23.0 months (95% CI: 10.6- not reached). As of the April 2021 data cutoff date, 13 of 24 patients (54%) remained on study.
For context, for other therapies studied in recurrent LGSOC, response rates have been between 6% and 26% and mPFS was between 7.2 and 13.0 months.
In the FRAME study, the most common Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were creatine kinase elevation (12%), rash (8%), diarrhea (4%), mouth ulcer/mucositis/glossitis (4%), and hyperbilirubinemia (4%), with only one discontinuation due to adverse events as of the data cutoff.
These updated data suggest that the novel, intermittent dosing schedule used in the FRAME study continues to show encouraging clinical activity in patients with recurrent LGSOC, including in patients previously treated with a MEK inhibitor.
Phase II study (known as RAMP (RAF and MEK Program) 201 Study) Registration-Directed Trial of VS-6766 and Defactinib in Recurrent LGSOC
The RAMP 201 Study that was initiated in November 2020 is a registration-directed clinical trial of VS-6766 and defactinib, in patients with recurrent LGSOC. 

11




The RAMP 201 Study is an adaptive two-part multicenter, parallel cohort, randomized, open label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VS-6766 alone and in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC. The first part of the study will determine the optimal regimen of either VS-6766 monotherapy or in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent KRAS mutated and KRAS wild type LGSOC randomized 1:1 in each treatment arm. The determination of which regimen to take forward into the expansion phase of the trial, which will enroll both KRAS mutated and KRAS wild type LGSOC, will be made based on objective response rate data, safety data and duration of response. The expansion phase of the study will examine efficacy and safety parameters of the regimen selected. Trial enrollment is underway in the United States and Europe. In January 2022, it was reported that target enrollment in the selection phase was completed and enrollment continues in the expansion phase for both treatment arms, KRAS mutated and KRAS wild type LGSOC (including both for VS-6766 alone and in combination with defactinib).

Phase II Study (known as RAMP (RAF and MEK Program) 202 Study) Registration-Directed Trial of VS-6766 and Defactinib in Previously Treated KRAS Mutant NSCLC
The RAMP 202 Study that was initiated in December 2020 is a registration-directed clinical trial of VS-6766 and defactinib, in patients with KRAS G12V mutant NSCLC. Additionally, the combination of VS-6766 with defactinib is being evaluated in several exploratory cohorts including KRAS non-G12V and BRAF (V600E and non-V600E) mutant NSCLC. Based on preclinical rationale, we have added BRAF mutant cohorts (V600E and non-V600E) to the RAMP 202 study in order to efficiently evaluate VS-6766 with defactinib in BRAF-mutant NSCLC. 
The RAMP 202 study is a Phase 2, adaptive two-part multicenter, parallel cohort, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VS-6766 alone and in combination with defactinib in patients with KRAS and BRAF mutant NSCLC, following treatment with a platinum-based regimen and immune checkpoint inhibitor. The first part of the study will determine the optimal regimen of either VS-6766 monotherapy or in combination with defactinib in patients with KRAS G12V NSCLC. The second phase of the study (expansion phase) will examine efficacy and safety parameters of the most effective regimen in patients with KRAS G12V NSCLC.
Phase II Study of VS-6766 Combined with Defactinib in Patients with Metastatic Uveal Melanoma
The Phase 2 IST was initiated in January 2021 and is an open-label, single arm, investigator-initiated study that is designed to assess potential efficacy, survival benefit and safety profile of the VS-6766/defactinib combination in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. The Phase 2 study is being led by Dr. Takami Sato and is a single-institution study being conducted at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. In this study, VS-6766 is being administered at 3.2 mg twice-weekly with defactinib at 200 mg twice daily administered three out of every four weeks. This recommended Phase 2 dose for the combination is based on the FRAME study.
Phase 1/2 Trial (known as RAMP (RAF and MEK Program) 203 Study) of VS-6766 in combination with Amgen’s LUMAKRAS ™ (sotorasib) in patients with KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC
In September 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Amgen to evaluate the combination of VS-6766 with Amgen’s KRAS G12C inhibitor LUMAKRASTM (sotorasib) in a Phase 1/2 trial entitled RAMP 203. The Phase 1/2 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of VS-6766 in combination with LUMAKRASTM in patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC who have not been previously treated with a KRAS G12C inhibitor as well as in patients who have progressed on a KRAS G12C inhibitor. The study will therefore investigate the potential benefits of a more complete vertical blockade of the RAS pathway with the combination of VS-6766 with LUMAKRASTM (G12C inhibition) in KRAS G12C-mutant locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
Phase 1/2 Trial (known as RAMP (RAF and MEK Program) 204 Study) of VS-6766 in combination with Mirati’s adagrasib in patients with KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC
In November 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement to evaluate the combination of Mirati’s investigation KRAS G12C inhibitor adagrasib with VS-6766 in patients with KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC. The primary objective of this multi-center, single-arm, open-label Phase 1/2 trial entitled RAMP 204 is to determine 

12




the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose for the combination of adagrasib and VS-6766 in patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC. The study will also investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the combination in patients who have progressed on a KRAS-G12C inhibitor. The trial will build on preclinical data showing deeper blockade of ERK pathway signaling resulting in enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with the combination of adagrasib and VS-6766 relative to either agent alone.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of treatment and patient selection created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention.
Patents
Our patent portfolio includes issued and pending applications worldwide. These patent applications fall into three categories: (1) RAF/MEK inhibition program; (2) FAK inhibition program; and (3) other programs.
RAF/MEK inhibition program
We have exclusively licensed a portfolio of four patent families owned by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Chugai).

Patent Term
The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
The term of a United States patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one United States patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug, and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency.
LICENSES AND COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS
Secura 
On August 10, 2020, we and Secura Bio, Inc. (Secura) signed an Asset Purchase Agreement (Secura APA) and on September 30, 2020, the transaction closed.
Pursuant to the Secura APA, we sold to Secura our exclusive worldwide license for the research, development, commercialization, and manufacture in oncology indications of products containing duvelisib. The sale included certain intellectual property related to duvelisib in oncology indications, certain existing duvelisib inventory, claims and rights under certain contracts pertaining to duvelisib. Pursuant to the Secura APA, Secura assumed all operational and financial responsibility for activities that were part of the duvelisib oncology program, including all commercialization efforts related to duvelisib in the United States and Europe, as well as our ongoing duvelisib clinical trials.

In connection with the Secura APA, we and Secura entered into a transition services agreement (Secura TSA). Under the terms of the Secura TSA, we provided certain support functions at Secura’s direction for a term of less than one year from the date of execution. Services performed were paid at a mutually agreed upon rate.
Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
On January 7, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Chugai (the Chugai Agreement) whereby Chugai granted us an exclusive worldwide license for the development, commercialization, and manufacture of products containing VS-6766.
Under the terms of the Chugai Agreement, we received an exclusive right to develop and commercialize products containing VS-6766 at our own cost and expense. In February 2020, we paid Chugai a non-refundable payment of $3.0 million. We are further obligated to pay Chugai double-digit royalties on net sales of products containing VS-6766, subject to reduction in certain circumstances. Chugai also obtained opt back rights to develop and commercialize VS-6766 (a) in the European Union, which option may be exercised through the date we submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for a product which contains VS-6766 as the sole active pharmaceutical ingredient and (b) in Japan and Taiwan, which option may be exercised through the date we receive marketing authorization from the FDA for a product which contains VS-6766 as the sole active pharmaceutical ingredient. As consideration for executing either option, Chugai would have to make a payment to us calculated on the Company’s development costs to date. Chugai and we have made customary representations and warranties and have agreed to certain customary covenants, including confidentiality and indemnification.
Unless earlier terminated, the Chugai Agreement will expire upon the fulfillment of our royalty obligations to Chugai for the sale of any products containing the VS-6766, which royalty obligations expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, upon the last to occur, in each specific country, of (a) expiration of valid patent claims covering such product or (b) 12 years from the first commercial sale of such product in such country. 
We may terminate the Chugai Agreement upon 180 days’ written notice. Subject to certain limitations, Chugai may terminate the Chugai Agreement upon written notice if we challenge any patent licensed by Chugai to us under the Chugai Agreement. Either party may terminate the license agreement in its entirety with 120 days’ written notice for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure the breach. Either party may also terminate the Chugai Agreement in its entirety upon certain insolvency events involving the other party.
Pfizer Inc.
On July 11, 2012, we entered into a license agreement (the Pfizer Agreement) with Pfizer under which Pfizer granted us worldwide, exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing certain of Pfizer’s inhibitors of FAK, including defactinib, for all therapeutic, diagnostic and prophylactic uses in humans. We have the right to grant sublicenses under the foregoing licensed rights, subject to certain restrictions. We are solely responsible, at our own expense, for the clinical development of these products, which is to be conducted in accordance with an agreed-upon development plan. We are also responsible for all manufacturing and commercialization activities at our own expense. Pfizer provided us with an initial quantity of clinical supplies of one of the products for an agreed upon price.
Upon entering into the Pfizer Agreement, we made a one-time cash payment to Pfizer in the amount of $1.5 million and issued 192,012 shares of our common stock. Pfizer is also eligible to receive up to $2.0 million in developmental milestones and up to an additional $125.0 million based on the successful attainment of regulatory and commercial sales milestones. Pfizer is also eligible to receive high single to mid-double-digit royalties on future net sales of the products. Our royalty obligations with respect to each product in each country begin on the date of first commercial sale of the product in that country, and end on the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of the product in that country or the date of expiration or abandonment of the last claim contained in any issued patent or patent application licensed by Pfizer to us that covers the product in that country.
The Pfizer Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all our royalty obligations to Pfizer, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. So long as we are not in breach of the Pfizer 

16




Agreement, we have the right to terminate the license agreement at will on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, or in its entirety, upon 90 days written notice to Pfizer. Either party has the right to terminate the Pfizer Agreement in connection with an insolvency event involving the other party or a material breach of the Pfizer Agreement by the other party that remains uncured for a specified period of time. If the Pfizer Agreement is terminated by either party for any reason, worldwide rights to the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of the products revert back to Pfizer.
COMPETITION
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, side effects, convenience, price, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. There are many generic products currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and targeted drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. To the extent our product candidates are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to existing drug or other therapies, our product candidates will not be competitive with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of adverse events, and none of them are successful in treating all patients. As a result, the level of morbidity and mortality from cancer remains high.
In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late stage clinical development to treat cancer. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience, and other 

17




benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval.

Oncology
In addition to companies that have inhibitors addressing our targets of interest, our competition also includes hundreds of private and publicly traded companies that operate in the area of oncology but have therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. The oncology market in general is highly competitive, with over 1,000 molecules currently in clinical development.
MANUFACTURING
We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. We currently work with one contract manufacturing organization (CMO) for the manufacture of VS-6766 drug product, one CMO for the production of VS-6766 drug substance, and one CMO for VS-6766 drug packaging/labeling. For defactinib, we currently have one CMO for the manufacture of drug product, one CMO for the production of drug substance, and one CMO for drug packaging /labeling. We have development agreements in place with these CMOs and we obtain drug substance, drug product and packaging/labeling services from these CMOs on a purchase order basis. We may elect to pursue relationships with other CMOs for manufacturing of drug product, drug substance, and packaging/labeling for later-stage clinical 

19




trials, commercialization or for risk management. We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We have personnel with pharmaceutical development and manufacturing experience who are responsible for the relationships with our CMOs.
All of our drug candidates are organic compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. We select compounds not only on the basis of their potential efficacy and safety, but also for their ease of synthesis and the reasonable cost of their starting materials. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at third-party CMOs.

APPLICABLE LAWS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
United States drug approval process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (IND) application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (GCP) and other clinical-trial related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA and payment of user fees for FDA review of NDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20





● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical studies
Before testing any product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective thirty days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a NDA or, in certain circumstances, post-approval.

21




Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, scheduled in 2022 to exceed $3.1 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees, based on the number of approved products. These fees are typically adjusted annually. User fee statutory authority expires every five years. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act was re-authorized for an additional five years in 2017 until 2022. Fee waivers are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for an orphan drug application.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months after accepting the application for filing, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months after accepting the application for filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan drug designation.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to 

22




develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If the FDA issues a complete response letter, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval, which are designed to expedite or facilitate the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs and biologics to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
Fast Track Designation. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that the product is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment, and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request.
In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Breakthrough Designation. A drug may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The breakthrough therapy designation provides all the benefits of the fast track program, including the eligibility for rolling review. The FDA may take certain administrative actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to aid sponsors in designing the clinical trials. 

23




Although breakthrough designation does not affect the regulatory standards for approval, the frequent interactions with the FDA may facilitate a more efficient development program. In addition, the breakthrough designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification. 
Priority Review. Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for priority review, or review within a six-month time frame, compared to the ten-month time frame for a standard review, from the time a complete application is accepted for filing. Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) are eligible for priority review if they provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease.
Accelerated Approval. Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of one or more Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Orphan drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
Abbreviated New Drug Applications
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.

24




The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

● | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the NDA or patent holder’s receipt of the Paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity period, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA for the conditions of use covered by the exclusivity, but FDA requires as a condition of approval new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, federal law also provides that periods of patent and non-patent marketing exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for a drug may be extended by six months if the NDA sponsor conducts pediatric studies identified by the FDA in a written request. For written requests issued by the FDA after September 27, 2007, the date of enactment of the FDAAA, the FDA must grant pediatric exclusivity no later than nine months prior to the date of expiration of patent or non-patent exclusivity in order for the six-month pediatric extension to apply to that exclusivity period.
Combination Therapy 
Combination therapy is a treatment modality that involves the use of two or more drugs to be used in combination to treat a disease or condition. If those drugs are combined in one dosage form, such as one pill, that is known as a fixed dose combination product and it is reviewed pursuant to the FDA’s Combination Rule at 21 CFR 300.50. The Rule provides that two or more drugs may be combined in a single dosage form when each component contributes to the claimed effects and the dosage of each component (amount, frequency, duration) is such that the combination is safe and effective for a significant patient population requiring such concurrent therapy as defined in the labeling for the drug. 
But not all combination therapy falls under the category of a fixed dose combination. For example, the FDA recognizes that two drugs in separate dosage forms and in separate packaging, that otherwise might be administered as monotherapy for an indication, also may be used in combination for the same indication. In 2013, the FDA issued 

25




guidance to assist sponsors that were developing the range of combination therapies that fall outside the category of fixed dose combinations. That guidance provides recommendations and advice on such topics as: (1) assessment at the outset whether two or more therapies are appropriate for use in combination; (2) guiding principles for nonclinical and clinical development of the combination; (3) options for regulatory pathways to seek marketing approval of the combination; and (4) post-marketing safety monitoring and reporting obligations. Given the wide range of potential combination therapy variations, the FDA indicated it intends to assess each potential combination on a case-by case basis and encouraged sponsors to engage in early and regular consultation with the relevant review division at the agency throughout the development process for its proposed combination.
Combination products
The FDA regulates combinations of products that cross FDA centers, such as drug, biologic or medical device components that are physically, chemically or otherwise combined into a single entity, as a combination product. The FDA center with primary jurisdiction for the combination product will take the lead in the premarket review of the product, with the other center consulting or collaborating with the lead center.
The FDA’s Office of Combination Products (OCP) determines which center will have primary jurisdiction for the combination product based on the combination product’s “primary mode of action.” A mode of action is the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action. The primary mode of action is the mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product, or the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product.
Often it is difficult for the OCP to determine with reasonable certainty the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. In those difficult cases, the OCP will consider consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions, or which center has the most expertise to evaluate the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product.
A sponsor may use a voluntary formal process, known as a Request for Designation, when the product classification is unclear or in dispute, to obtain a binding decision as to which center will regulate the combination product. If the sponsor objects to that decision, it may request that the agency reconsider that decision.
Other regulatory requirements
Any drug manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

26




Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Additional provisions
Physician drug samples
As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians, as well as prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations.
Foreign regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Regardless of our current FDA approval or any future FDA approvals we may obtain for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of new drug products. Sales of product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered 

27




by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. We may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
Within the United States, FDA-approved drugs could potentially be covered by various government health benefit programs as well as purchased by government agencies. The participation in such programs or the sale of products to such agencies is subject to regulation. The marketability of any of our approved products may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. 
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, participating manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. 
Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals aged 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Oral drugs may be covered under Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. Under the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program, manufacturers with marketed brand name drugs are required to provide a 70% discount the negotiated price for on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.
Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the Public Health Service (PHS) pharmaceutical pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation. 
To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices 

28




charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
The marketability of products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, there is an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for a product, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

New legislation and regulations
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the United States Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. For example, in December 2016, Congress enacted and President Obama signed into law the 21st Century Cures Act that amends a number of sections of the FDCA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.





In the United States, federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, healthcare, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Healthcare Reform Act, which expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs as well as the imposition of annual fees on manufacturers of branded pharmaceuticals. There have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the Healthcare Reform Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Healthcare Reform Act. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision,

Beyond the Healthcare Reform Act, there have been ongoing health care reform efforts. Some recent healthcare reform efforts have sought to address certain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an expansion of telehealth coverage under Medicare and accelerated or advanced Medicare payments to healthcare providers. Other reform efforts affect pricing or payment for drug products. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program has been subject to statutory and regulatory changes and the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap increased from 50% to 70%. Additional reform efforts are likely. The Biden administration has focused on reforms that would address the high cost of drugs. In response to an Executive Order from President Biden, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services issued a comprehensive plan for addressing high drug prices that describes a number of legislative approaches and identifies administrative tools to address the high cost of drugs. In addition, Democrats included drug pricing reform provisions reflecting elements of the plan in a broader proposed spending package in late 2021 - such as capping Medicare Part D patients out-of-pocket costs; establishing penalties for drug prices that increase faster than inflation in Medicare; and authorizing the federal government to negotiate prices on certain, select high cost drugs under Medicare Parts B and D.
Healthcare reform efforts have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. For example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. Pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026.
Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been efforts at the federal level to implement measures to regulate drug pricing or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. As another example, legislation passed in 2019 revised how certain prices reported by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated and legislation enacted in 2021 eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024.
Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Health Care Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state healthcare reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results. Drug development is a complex endeavor which requires deep expertise and experience across a broad array of disciplines.
