Our business plan is owning, leasing and/or operating senior living residences that provide seniors with a supportive, home life setting with care and services, including activities of daily living, life enrichment and health and wellness in certain cities in China. We also plan to operate a network carrier, providing scheduled air transportation to passengers, travel destination services to leisure travelers.
 
The Senior Living Industry
 
Through our newly acquired and wholly-owned subsidiary, Shanghai Hongfu Health management Ltd., we purchased senior living facilities in April 2018, launched a senior living residences business, which, hosts to mostly men and women over the age of 50. We intend to expand the business of owning, leasing and/or operating senior living residences that will provide seniors with supportive, home life setting with care and services, including activities of daily living, life enrichment and health and wellness in China.
 
The senior living industry encompasses a broad spectrum of senior living service and care options, which include independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing care. Our primary focus will be on the independent living services. Independent living is designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers where they receive services such as housekeeping, meals and activities, but are not reliant on assistance with activities of daily living (for example, bathing, eating and dressing), although we may offer these services through contracts with third parties.
 
Our operating philosophy is to provide services and care which meet the individual needs of its residents, and to enhance their physical and mental well-being, thereby allowing them to live longer and to “age in place.” These facilities will offer, on a 24-hour basis, personal, supportive and home health care services appropriate for their residents in a home-like setting, which allow residents to maintain their independence and quality of life. We predict that the average of the residents at our facilities will be between 55 and 70.
 
Our primary focus will be in China, where we intend to grow and become a leader in senior living facilities. We also will seek to develop or acquire facilities and manage or cooperate with existing facilities as well. We believe that by concentrating or “clustering” our facilities in target areas with desirable demographics, can increase the efficiency of our management resources and achieve broad economies of scale.
 
The long-term care industry encompasses a wide continuum of services and residential arrangements for elderly senior citizens. Skilled nursing facilities provide the highest level of care and are designed for elderly senior citizens who need chronic nursing and medical attention and are not able to live on their own. Further, skilled nursing facilities tend to be one of the most expensive alternatives while providing elderly senior citizens with limited independence and a diminished quality of life. On the other end of the continuum is home-based care, which typically is provided in an individual’s private residence. While this alternative allows the elderly individual to “age in place” in his or her home and, in certain instances, can provide most of the services available at a skilled nursing facility, it does not foster any sense of community or the ability to participate in group activities.

Assisted living facilities generally are designed to fill the gap in the middle of this continuum. Assisted living facilities have been described by the Assisted Living Federation of America (“ALFA”) as providing a special combination of housing and personal, supportive and home health care services designed to respond to the individual needs of those who need, or desire help with their activities of daily living, including personal care and household management. Services in an assisted living facility are generally available 24 hours a day to meet the scheduled and unscheduled needs of residents, thereby promoting maximum dignity and independence.
 
The assisted living industry is highly fragmented in China. At present, the industry is characterized by participants who operate only a limited number of facilities and who frequently can offer only basic assistance with a limited number of activities of daily living. We intend to be characterized by the following: (i) the ability to offer premium accommodations and a comprehensive bundle of standard services for a single inclusive monthly fee; (ii) sophisticated, professional management structures and highly trained employees; (iii) a cost-efficient, user-specific prototype facility; and (iv) experience in providing home health care services.
 
Our facilities will provide services and care which are designed to meet the individual needs of its residents, enhance their physical and mental well-being and promote a supportive, independent and home-like setting. Most of our facilities will be primarily designed as premium facilities at which residents receive a comprehensive, bundled package of standard services for a single monthly fee.
 
We will strive to combine in our facilities the best aspects of independent living with the protection and safety of assisted living, with trained staff members who provide 24-hour care and monitoring of every resident. The senior living facilities will be designed and decorated to have a home-like atmosphere. Residents will be encouraged to furnish their rooms with personal items they have collected during their lifetime. Our senior living facilities differ from skilled nursing facilities in that our senior living facilities will not provide the more extensive, and costly, nursing and medical care found in nursing homes.
 
Aviation and Travel
 
In less than two decades China has grown from travel minnows to the world’s more powerful outbound market. According to China Tourism Academy, Chinese travelers made a total of 140 million outbound trips in 2018, up 13.5 percent from the previous year’s 129 million. They have spent more than $120 billion, compared to $100 billion in 2017. China has become a main contributor to the global tourism industry. The China outbound Tourism Research Institute predicts that overseas trips by the Chinese residents will reach more than 400 million by 2030.
 
In April 2019, we entered into a Business Project Investment Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) through our wholly owned subsidiary with Palau Asia-Pacific International Aviation and Travel Agency consisting of Palau Asia Pacific Air Management Limited, Global Tourism Management Limited and Global (Guangzhou) Tourism Service Co., Ltd. (collectively the “Project Company”) pursuant to which we will acquire 51% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Project Company for $8,000,000, representing 49% of the Project Company’s dividend distribution, voting rights and liquidation interest of assets.
 
The Project Company currently has 2 scheduled air lines from Macao to Palau, where there is a series of islands in West Pacific Rim and Macao to Cambodia. Palau is relatively unknown destination for Chinese travelers. We control marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. Our mission is to help Chinese leisure travelers experience Palau and to became a travel company that will provide one stop for all by providing passenger airlines, hotel reservations services and other excursion activity booking services on Palau. We have completed an initial payment of $3,000,000 of the total $8,000,000 purchase price with remaining payments of $2,000,000 and $3,000,00 due on June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019, respectively. However, the acquisition was subject to continuing due diligence, negotiation and customary closing conditions, including completion of an audit. The process of due diligence and audit are still on going. Therefore, additional payments have been postponed until a satisfactory audit can be delivered and other due diligence has been completed. We cannot be assured that the transaction will be completed as intended.
