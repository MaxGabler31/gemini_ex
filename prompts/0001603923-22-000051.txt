Our primary objective is to create and build value through sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation in our product lines from the disciplined use of capital and a strong customer focus.
Our customers’ objectives are continually evolving and are currently focused on disciplined capital and operational expenditures, generating positive cash flow, reducing emissions, participating in the energy transition, and enhancing safety. Weatherford has aligned its technology development and operations around these objectives and expanded its role as a market leading provider of solutions that assists our customers in addressing their key operational challenges not just in conventional reservoirs but also in the following:
•Mature Fields: rejuvenating aging assets through optimizing lift efficiency, restoring wellbore integrity, accelerating reservoir recovery, and permanently abandoning wells when they are no longer economic to produce;
•Unconventionals: enabling customers to solve reservoir challenges and maximize production by drilling faster, deeper, safer and cheaper and combating production declines through accurate reservoir evaluation, efficient well construction, effective stimulation, and production optimization;
•Offshore: supporting customers sustain high-margin, long-term production with a focus on reducing rig time, enhancing safety and reliability, and increasing well integrity through the optimization of well placement and construction;
•Digitalization and Automation: leveraging our core competencies and significant presence at well sites to capture, analyze and present information for our customers to enable better decision making by leveraging the internet of things, multiple data sources, advanced analytics, and cloud computing across our many solutions.
We have driven this solution-based focus across our organization through a commitment to improving safety and service quality, embedding a returns-focused mindset in our organization, and developing and commercializing new technologies that add value to our customers’ operations.
Markets

Demand for our industry’s services and products depends in part upon commodity prices, number of oil and gas rigs and wells drilled, depth and drilling conditions of wells, number of well completions, age of existing wells, reservoir depletion, regulatory environment and the level of workover activity worldwide.
Technology is critical to the energy services marketplace as a result of the maturity of the world’s oil and natural gas reservoirs, the acceleration of production decline rates and the focus on complex well designs, including deepwater prospects. Customers continue to seek, test and use production-enabling technologies at an increasing rate. We invest substantial resources into building our technology offerings, which enable our customers to find and produce oil and natural gas more efficiently. Our products and services enable our customers to increase production rates while reducing their costs of drilling and production.
Reportable Segments
The Company's chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), our chief executive officer, regularly reviews information to make operating decisions, allocate resources and assess performance of the business. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the CODM changed the information regularly reviewed to be aligned with how we offer our services and technologies in relation to the well life cycle and we have realigned our reportable segments to reflect the change. We now have three reportable segments: (1) Drilling and Evaluation (2) Well Construction and Completions, and (3) Production and Intervention. Previously we had two geographic based reportable segments, Western Hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere.

We maintain world-class technology and training centers throughout the world. Additionally, we have research, development and engineering facilities focused on developing new technologies and improving existing products and services to meet customer demands for improved drilling performance, well integrity, and enhanced reservoir productivity, with emphasis on safety and the environment. Weatherford has significant expertise, trade secrets, intellectual property and know-how with respect to manufacturing our equipment and providing our services. As many areas of our business rely on patents and proprietary technology, we seek and ensure patent protection both inside and outside the U.S. for products and methods that we believe to have commercial significance. Although in the aggregate our patents are important to the manufacturing and marketing of many of our products and services, we do not believe that the expiration of any one of our patents would have a materially adverse effect on our business. 
Seasonality
The widespread geographical locations of our operations serve to mitigate the overall impact of the seasonal nature of our business in any particular geographic region. Weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the level of demand for our products and services. Spring months in Canada and winter months in the North Sea and Russia can affect our operations negatively. Additionally, heavy rains, hurricanes, unusual extreme freezes or other climate changes may impact our results. Unpredictable or unusually harsh weather conditions could lengthen the periods of reduced activity and have a detrimental impact on our results of operations. In addition, customer spending patterns for our products and services may result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each calendar year as our customers seek to fully utilize their annual budgets. 
Federal Regulation and Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally relating to the energy industry in general and the environment in particular. Our 2021 expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations were not material, and we currently do not expect the cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations for 2022 to be material.
We have obligations and expect to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures, as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Among those obligations, are the current requirements imposed by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) at the former Universal Compression facility in Midland, Texas. At this location we are performing a TCEQ-approved Remedial Action Plan (“RAP”) to address contaminated ground water. The performance of the RAP and related expenses are scheduled to be performed over a ten to twenty-year period and, may cost as much as $6 million, all of which is recorded as an undiscounted obligation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. We continuously monitor and strive to maintain compliance with changes in laws and regulations that impact our business.
