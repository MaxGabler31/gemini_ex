ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company Overview
 
InnerScope Hearing Technologies, Inc. (“InnerScope” or the “Company”) is a Nevada Corporation incorporated June 15, 2012, with its principal place of business in Roseville, California.
 
On June 20, 2012, InnerScope acquired InnerScope Advertising Agency, LLC (“ILLC”), a commonly owned entity, to provide advertising/marketing services to the hearing device industry in accordance with an Acquisition and Plan of Share Exchange with ILLC.
 
On November 1, 2013, InnerScope acquired Intela-Hear, LLC (“Intela-Hear”), a commonly owned entity, with an Acquisition and Plan of Share Exchange with Intela-Hear.
 
On August 25, 2017, the Company changed its name to InnerScope Hearing Technologies, Inc. to better reflect the Company's current direction as a hearing health technology company that manufactures, develops, distributes, and sells numerous innovative hearing health-related products, hearing treatments, and hearing solutions direct to consumer (DTC) with a scalable business model. The Company began offering its own line of FDA (Food and Drug Administration) registered Hearing Aids and its “Hearable”, and “Wearable” Personal Sound Amplifier Products (PSAPs). On July 5, 2018, the Company signed a supplier agreement as a direct shipped vendor ("DSV") for Walmart.com. The Company has been accepted as a Walmart.com USA, LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.) supplier and will sell its FDA-Registered Hearing Aids and its PSAP to Walmart.com as the retailer for their Direct-To-Consumer online retail sale.
 
The Company is a manufacturer and a distributor/retailer of Direct-to-Consumer ("DTC") FDA (Food and Drug Administration) registered hearing aids, personal sound amplifier products (PSAPs), hearing-related treatment therapies, and doctor-formulated dietary hearing supplements (“Hearing Products”). The Company's mission is to improve the quality of life of the 70 million people in North America and the 1.5 billion people worldwide who suffer from hearing impairment and/or hearing-related issues. The management team of InnerScope is applying decades of industry experience and believes it is well-positioned with its innovative in-store point-of-sale Free Self-Check Hearing Screening Kiosks ("Hearing Kiosks") to directly benefit when the Over-the-Counter (OTC) Hearing Aid Act (the "OTC Hearing Aid Law") (see below “Proposed Rule for OTC Category for Hearing Aids”) becomes enacted (expected in 4th quarter of 2022) (the OTC Hearing Aid Law allows OTC hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing losses to be sold in retail stores without a prescription or having to see a professional). The Hearing Kiosk is designed for the tens of millions of Americans with undetected/untreated mild-to-moderate hearing losses to treat themselves with the Company's easy, convenient, and affordable hearing products.
 
On September 10, 2018, the Company acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Kathy L Amos Audiology (“Amos Audiology”) in exchange for 340,352 shares of common stock (the “Acquisition”). Amos Audiology provides retail hearing aid sales and audiological services in the East Bay area of San Francisco.

We are dedicated to serving the retail hearing aid dispensing community and developing a program to contribute to various hearing aid focused charities.
 
InnerScope is an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.
 
InnerScope will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest occurrence of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of at least $1billion (as indexed for inflation), (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering, (3)  the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt and (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”).

InnerScope also qualifies as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
 
Our authorized capital stock currently consists of 14,975,000,000 shares of common stock, and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our common stock is listed on The OTCQB under the symbol “INND.”
 
Our principal corporate headquarters is located at 2151 Professional Drive, Second Floor, Roseville, CA. 95661. Our telephone number is (916) 218-4100. Our website address is www.innd.com.

Company’s Business Model
 
The Company's Hearing Products and its business model allow breaking through the persistent barriers that prevent access to effective hearing solutions. For example, the Company's recent acquisition of iHear Medical Inc., a DTC cloud-based hearing solution provider, gives access to over 40 patents and an FDA-registered manufacturing and R&D facility. In addition, the Company has acquired HearingAssist, an established leader in the direct-to-consumer hearing aid market with a customer base of over 400,000. These acquisitions, combined with a partnership with Atlazo Inc., a semiconductor innovator for next-generation AI smart devices, will allow the Company to take the lead position in the direct-to-consumer hearing solutions market by selling innovated proprietary advanced hearing products through Walmart and other major Big Box retailers.
 
The Company's full line of FDA-Registered Hearing Aids, PSAPs and Hearing Health products (“Hearing Products”) are currently available through multiple retail/wholesale channels: Walmart, Walmart.com, Walmart Canada, RiteAid.com, BestBuy.com, Amazon.com, Giant Eagle, Hy-Vee, Hartig Drug, Food City, and Cardinal Health dba RGH Enterprises Inc., which provides the Company's products to FSAStore.com, HSAStore.com, and WellDeservedHealth.com. In addition, the Company's Hearing Products will soon be available with more major retailers and pharmacy chains for in-store and online purchases.
 
Competition
 
We have numerous direct, indirect and partial competitors, many of which have valuable industry relationships and access to greater resources than we do. There is no assurance that we will be able to provide services that will be competitive in the marketplace, and even if competitive, that we will be able to earn a profit.
 
The internet is fast becoming a major factor in the distribution of hearing aids. In the U.S. numerous companies are on the internet advertising hearing aids at inexpensive prices. We compete directly with these internet companies which are similar to our business model, and to include Listen Lively, Audicus, and Eargo. In addition, the hearing device industry is controlled by 5 global manufacturers. These manufacturers are GN Store Nord, Sonova, Starkey Hearing Technologies, William Demant and WS Audiology, all of which have established products and substantially greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing and development resources than we possess. We also compete against traditional brick and mortar retail hearing clinics which primarily sells the 5 global manufacturers products.
 
Intellectual Property
 With our asset purchase of iHear Medical Inc. we acquired access rights and license to over 40 U.S. patents for hearing aid technology. This includes 100% ownership to the only FDA-Cleared in-home hearing test, called the iHearTest. We also have numerous copyrights, trademarks, and inventions assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We have two provisional patents filed that may not result in issued patents. We cannot be certain that any of the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights in these countries as fully as in the United States.
 Government Regulation.
 We are subject to a limited variety of local, state, and federal regulations. Some of our products for example are registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), which regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, design, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) also regulates the advertising of our products in the United States. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training, and other practices to government scrutiny.
 
While we believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable regulations, there can be no assurances that from time-to-time unintentional violations of such regulations will not occur. We are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulation applied to businesses, such as payroll taxes on the state and federal levels. Our current business requires that we comply with state corporate filings, city or county business license and the necessary business liability insurance. The requirements of these regulations are minimal and do not cause any undue burden.

However, internet access and online services are not subject to direct regulation in the United States. Changes in the laws and regulations relating to the telecommunications and media industry, however, could impact our business. For example, the Federal Communications Commission could begin to regulate the Internet and online service industry, which could result in increased costs for us. The laws and regulations applicable to the Internet and to our services are evolving and unclear and could damage our business. There are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to, or commerce on, the Internet. Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted, covering issues such as user privacy, defamation, pricing, taxation, content regulation, quality of products and services, and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Such legislation could expose us to substantial liability as well as dampen the growth in use of the Internet, decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications and commercial medium, or require us to incur significant expenses in complying with any new regulations.
 
Regulation by the FDA
 
The FDA classifies hearing aids hearing aids as medical devices. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), as well as FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, device safety, premarket clearance and approval, establishment registration and device listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, recalls and field safety corrective actions, and post-market surveillance, including complaint handling and medical device reporting of adverse events.
 
We currently market and in compliance with the FDA regulations for our hearing aid products.
 
Proposed Rule for OTC Category for Hearing Aids
 
The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (“FDARA”), which was signed into law on August 18, 2017 (the “OTC Hearing Aid Act”) created a new category of over-the-counter (“OTC”) hearing aids that are intended to be available without supervision, prescription, or other order, involvement or intervention of a licensed practitioner. The language in FDARA is not self-implementing, which means that the OTC hearing aid category does not exist until there is effective regulation. On October 20, 2021, the FDA published a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish new regulatory categories for OTC and prescription hearing aids, among other things (the “Proposed Rule”). Under FDARA, the OTC hearing aid controls that are the subject of the rulemaking, if finalized, would preempt any state or local requirement specifically related to hearing products that would restrict or interfere with commercial activity involving OTC hearing aids. The comment period on the Proposed Rule, in which we participated in support of the Proposed Rule, ended on January 18, 2022, after which the FDA will review the comments. It is not clear whether the FDA will publish a final rule (the “Final Rule”), and whether the Final Rule will differ significantly from the Proposed Rule. However, if the FDA publishes a Final Rule, it would become effective 60 days after publication.
 Under the Proposed Rule, devices that require 510(k) clearance to be compliant with the rule requirements would need to be cleared by the effective date of the Final Rule in order to continue to be marketed. For all other currently marketed devices, the proposed compliance date is 180 days after the effective date of the Final Rule (240 days after the publication of the Final Rule). Hearing aids under existing regulations at 21 CFR 874.330 and 874.3305, both of which are exempt from 510(k) premarket review.

All of these financings were private transactions with accredited investors pursuant to Regulation D of Rule 506 or other exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
