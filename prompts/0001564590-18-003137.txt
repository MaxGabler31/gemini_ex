Item 1.  Business 
Overview 
 SpartanNash Company (together with its subsidiaries, “SpartanNash” or the “Company”) is a Fortune 350 company whose core businesses include distributing grocery products to independent grocery retailers (“independent retailers”), national retailers, food service distributors, its corporate owned retail stores, and United States (“U.S.”) military commissaries and exchanges. SpartanNash serves customer locations in 47 states and the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Italy, Bahrain, Djibouti and Egypt.  Through its Military segment, SpartanNash is a leading distributor of grocery products to military commissaries in the United States. The Company’s Retail segment operates neighborhood supermarkets that emphasize value beyond price, affordable wellness, commitment to local products and, as demonstrated throughout the organization, caring for their community and environment. The Company operates three reportable business segments: Food Distribution, Military and Retail. 
 The Company’s fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to December 31. The following discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ending or ended December 29, 2018 ("2018"), December 30, 2017 (“2017” or “current year”), December 31, 2016 (“2016” or “prior year”) and January 2, 2016 (“2015”), all of which include 52 weeks, and January 3, 2015 (“2014”), which included 53 weeks. All fiscal quarters are 12 weeks, except for the Company’s first quarter, which is 16 weeks and will generally include the Easter holiday. The fourth quarter includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and depending on the fiscal year end, may include the New Year’s holiday.
 Established in 1917 as a cooperative grocery distributor, Spartan Stores Inc. (“Spartan Stores”) converted to a for-profit business corporation in 1973. In January 1999, Spartan Stores began to acquire retail supermarkets in its focused geographic regions. In August 2000, Spartan Stores common stock became listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “SPTN.” On November 19, 2013, Spartan Stores merged with Nash-Finch Company (“Nash-Finch”) and the combined company was named SpartanNash Company. Unless the context otherwise requires, the use of the terms “SpartanNash,” and the “Company” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to the surviving corporation SpartanNash Company and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries.

On January 6, 2017, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Caito Foods Service (“Caito”) and Blue Ribbon Transport (“BRT”). Caito is a leading supplier of fresh fruit and vegetables as well as value-added fresh-cut fruits and vegetables and prepared meals to retailers and food service distributors across 21 states in the Southeast, Midwest and Eastern United States. BRT offers temperature-controlled distribution and logistics services throughout North America. The acquisition strengthened the Company’s fresh product offerings and value-added services, such as freshly-prepared centerplate and side dish categories, and also complements the Company’s existing supply chain network.
 The Company’s differentiated business model of Food Distribution, Military and Retail operations utilizes the complementary nature of each segment and enhances the ability of the Company’s independent retailers to compete in the grocery industry long-term. The model produces operational efficiencies, helps stimulate distribution product demand, and provides sharper visibility and broader business growth options. In addition, the diversification from Food Distribution, Military and Retail provides added flexibility to pursue the best long-term growth opportunities in each segment. 
 SpartanNash’s long-term goal is to create value for the Company's shareholders, retailers, and customers. To support these strategies, a well differentiated product offering in its Food Distribution, Military, and Retail segments has been established, as well as, the following key management priorities and strategies:

Food Distribution Segment 
 The Company’s Food Distribution segment uses a multi-channel sales approach to distribute grocery products to independent retailers, national retailers, food service distributors, e-commerce providers, and the Company’s corporate owned retail stores. Total net sales from the Company’s Food Distribution segment, including sales to corporate owned retail stores that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, were approximately $4.9 billion for 2017. As of the end of 2017, the Company believes it is the sixth largest wholesale distributor, in terms of annual revenue, to supermarkets in the United States. 
 Customers. The Company’s Food Distribution segment supplies grocery products to a diverse group of approximately 2,100 independent retailers with operations ranging from a single store to supermarket chains with over 20 stores, food service distributors and the Company’s corporate owned retail stores. As of December 30, 2017, the Company operates in 47 states by leveraging a platform of 19 distribution centers servicing the Food Distribution and Military segments, with the greatest sales concentration predominantly in the Midwest and South regions. This extensive geographic reach drives economies of scale and provides opportunities for independent retailers to purchase products at competitive prices in order to compete in the grocery industry long-term. 
 Through its Food Distribution segment, the Company also services national retailers, including Dollar General. Sales to Dollar General are made to more than 14,000 of its retail locations, with sales representing 14.0%, 11.2%, and 10.7% of consolidated net sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company’s Food Distribution customer base is diverse, and no other single customer exceeded 3% of consolidated net sales in any of the years presented.
 The Company’s ten largest Food Distribution customers (excluding corporate owned retail stores) accounted for approximately 52.0% of total Food Distribution net sales for 2017. Approximately 83% of Food Distribution net sales for 2017 are covered under supply agreements with independent retailers. 
 Products. The Company’s Food Distribution segment provides a selection of approximately 60,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) of nationally branded and private brand grocery products (see “Marketing and Merchandising – Private Brands”) and perishable food products, including dry groceries, produce, dairy products, meat, delicatessen items, bakery goods, frozen food, seafood, floral products, general merchandise, beverages, tobacco products, health and beauty care products and pharmacy. With the acquisition of Caito, the product offering also includes fresh protein-based foods, prepared meals, and value-added products such as fresh-cut fruits and vegetables and prepared salads. These product offerings, along with best in class services, allow independent retailers the opportunity to support the majority of their operations with a single supplier. Meeting consumers’ needs will continue to be SpartanNash’s priority as it continues to leverage its complementary business model of Food Distribution, Military and Retail operations. 
 Valued-Added Services. The Company provides a comprehensive menu of valued-added services designed to assist retailers in becoming more profitable, efficient, competitive, and informed. The Company’s service departments are strategic partners who fill the gaps when time and resources are limited for the independent customers. From real estate and site surveys to a full spectrum of merchandising and marketing solutions, independent retailers can find the support they need to effectively operate their businesses. The Company provides over 100 distinct value-added services, including the following: 
 
 
● Retail Development and Consulting | ● Consumer Research 
--------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------
● Merchandising | ● Product Reclamation 
● Marketing and Advertising Solutions | ● Inventory Support

Military Segment 
 The Company’s Military segment contracts with manufacturers and brokers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products, including dry groceries, beverages, meat, and frozen foods, primarily to U.S. military commissaries and exchanges. The Company’s Military segment, together with its partner, CPFD, represents the only worldwide delivery solution for providing grocery products to DeCA.
 The Company is also the DeCA exclusive worldwide supplier of private brand grocery and related products to U.S. military commissaries. In accordance with its contract with DeCA, the Company procures the grocery and related products from various manufacturers and upon receiving customer orders from DeCA, either delivers the products to the U.S. military commissaries itself or engages CPFD to deliver the products on its behalf. There are approximately 450 SKUs of private brand products currently in the DeCA system as of December 30, 2017, and the Company anticipates up to 1,400 SKUs will be added under the program in 2018.
 The distributed grocery products are delivered to over 160 military commissaries and over 440 exchanges located in more than 45 states across the United States, and the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Italy, Bahrain, Djibouti and Egypt. The Company’s distribution centers are strategically located among the largest concentration of military bases in the areas the Company serves and near Atlantic ports used to ship grocery products to overseas commissaries and exchanges. The Company’s Military segment has an outstanding reputation as a distributor focused on U.S. military commissaries and exchanges, based in large measure on its excellent service metrics, which include fill rate, on-time delivery and shipping accuracy.
 DeCA operates a chain of 237 commissaries on U.S. military installations across the world that sells approximately $4.8 billion of grocery products annually. DeCA contracts with manufacturers to obtain grocery products for the commissary system. Manufacturers either deliver the products to the commissaries themselves or, more commonly, contract with distributors such as SpartanNash to deliver the products. Manufacturers must authorize the distributors as their official representatives to DeCA, and the distributors must adhere to DeCA’s frequent delivery system (“FDS”) procedures governing matters such as product identification, ordering and processing, information exchange and resolution of discrepancies. The Company obtains distribution contracts with manufacturers through competitive bidding processes and direct negotiations. 
 As of December 30, 2017, the Company has approximately 250 distribution contracts representing approximately 600 manufacturers that supply products to the DeCA commissary system and various exchange systems. Generally, larger contracts or those subject to a request-for-proposal process have definitive durations, whereas smaller contracts generally have indefinite terms; and all contract types allow for termination by either party without cause upon 30 days prior written notice to the other party. The contracts typically specify which commissaries and exchanges to supply on behalf of the manufacturer, the manufacturer’s products to be supplied, service and delivery requirements, and pricing and payment terms. The Company’s ten largest manufacturer customers represented approximately 45.6% of the Company’s Military segment sales for 2017. 
 As commissaries need to be restocked, DeCA identifies the manufacturer with which an order is to be placed, determines which distributor is the manufacturer’s official representative for a particular commissary or exchange location, and then places a product order with that distributor under the auspices of DeCA’s master contract with the applicable manufacturer. The distributor selects that product from its existing inventory, delivers it to the commissary or commissaries designated by DeCA, and bills the manufacturer for the product shipped. The manufacturer then bills DeCA under the terms of its master contract. Overseas commissaries are serviced in a similar fashion, except that a distributor’s responsibility is to deliver products as and when needed to the port designated by DeCA, which in turn bears the responsibility for shipping the product to the applicable commissary or overseas warehouse. Due to the unique terms of this arrangement, working capital requirements are significant.
 After the Company ships a particular manufacturer’s products to commissaries in response to an order from DeCA, the Company invoices the manufacturer for the product price plus a drayage fee that is typically based on a percentage of the purchase price, but may in some cases be based on a dollar amount per case or pound of product sold. The Company’s order handling and invoicing activities are facilitated by procurement and billing systems developed specifically for the Military business, which address the unique aspects of its business, and provide the Company’s manufacturer customers with a web-based, interactive means of accessing critical order, inventory and delivery information.

Retail Segment 
 As of December 30, 2017, the Company operates 145 corporate owned retail stores in nine states, predominantly in the Midwest region primarily under the banners of Family Fare Supermarkets, D&W Fresh Market, VG’s Grocery, Dan’s Supermarket and Family Fresh Market. Retail banners and numbers of stores are more fully detailed in Item 2, “Properties,” of this report. The Company’s corporate owned retail stores range in size from approximately 14,000 to 90,000 total square feet, or on average, approximately 42,000 total square feet per store.
 The Company’s neighborhood market strategy distinguishes its corporate owned retail stores from supercenters and limited assortment stores by focusing on value beyond price, affordable wellness, commitment to local products, and caring for the community and environment. The Company’s strategy is also focused on increasing customer satisfaction through quality service and convenience, and in the second quarter of 2017, the Company introduced Fast Lane, its new online ordering and curbside pick-up service. The Company now offers the service in approximately 40 corporate owned retail stores and anticipates rolling it out to up to 30 stores in 2018. The Company also began piloting home delivery services in the fourth quarter of 2017 to further improve convenience and service for its customers.
 The Company’s corporate owned retail stores offer nationally branded and private brand grocery products (see “Marketing and Merchandising – Private Brands”), as well as perishable food products including dry groceries, produce, dairy products, meat, delicatessen items, bakery goods, frozen food, seafood, floral products, general merchandise, beverages, tobacco products and health and beauty care products. Private brand grocery products typically generate higher retail margins while also improving customer loyalty by offering quality products at affordable prices.
 As of December 30, 2017, the Company offers pharmacy services in 87 of its corporate owned retail stores (of which 76 of the pharmacies are owned), and operates one free-standing pharmacy location. The Company believes the pharmacy service offering in its corporate owned retail stores is an important part of the consumer experience. In its Michigan pharmacies and a number of its pharmacies in Minnesota and Nebraska, the Company offers free medications (antibiotics, diabetic medications and prenatal vitamins) along with generic drugs for $4 and $10, and meal planning solutions for preventative health and education for its customers. 
 As of December 30, 2017, the Company operates 31 fuel centers primarily at its corporate owned retail stores operating predominantly under the banners Family Fare Quick Stop and D&W Quick Stop. These fuel centers offer refueling facilities and in the adjacent convenience store, a limited variety of popular consumable products. The Company’s prototypical Quick Stop stores are approximately 1,100 square feet in size. 
 The Company’s corporate owned retail stores are primarily the result of acquisitions prior to June 2015, including the merger with Nash-Finch in November 2013. The following chart details the changes in the number of corporate owned retail stores over the last five fiscal years, including the transition year ended December 28, 2013:
 
 
 | 2013 | | 2014 | | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 
-------------------------------------------+------+-----+------+-----+------+------+------+----
Number of stores at beginning of year | | 101 | | 172 | | 162 | | 163 | 157
Stores acquired or constructed during year | | 78 | | 1 | | 7 | | — | — 
Stores closed or sold during year | | 7 | | 11 | | 6 | | 6 | 12 
Number of stores at end of year | | 172 | | 162 | | 163 | | 157 | 145

 During 2017, the Company completed five major remodels and also opened one new fuel center. In connection with the remodeling efforts, the Company converted three corporate owned retail stores to the Family Fare Supermarkets banner. The Company expects to continue making targeted capital investments during 2018 through remodels at select corporate owned retail stores and, if opportunities arise, by either opening additional fuel centers or entering into partnerships with existing fuel operations. The Company will continue to evaluate its store base and expects to close or sell five to seven stores in 2018 depending on circumstances and opportunities.

Supply Chain Network
 The Company continues to integrate its supply chain organization to optimize the network, increase asset utilization and leverage programs that will drive more value for its retailers, customers, and shareholders. The Company continually reviews the optimization of its network and, through doing so, has added Food Distribution operations to several facilities which were previously dedicated solely to the Military segment. The Company consolidated one warehouse during the year and may close, open, or acquire warehouses in the future depending on needs and opportunities. The Company also made significant progress in integrating the Caito and BRT operations by rolling out Caito products to other warehouses and customers and by integrating BRT with its managed freight function to gain efficiencies and reduce costs, as well as drive growth in the brokerage business by maximizing backhaul opportunities and meeting supplier needs. 
 The Company’s distribution network is comprised of 19 distribution centers, which are utilized to service the Food Distribution and Military segments. The distribution centers provide for approximately 8.7 million total square feet of warehouse space. The Company has new and ongoing initiatives to improve the efficiency of its supply chain through innovation, investments in technology and automation.
 The Company operates a fleet of approximately 500 over-the-road tractors, 450 dry vans, and 1,000 refrigerated trailers. Through routing optimization systems, the Company carefully manages the more than 64 million miles driven by its fleet and third party carriers annually servicing military commissaries, exchanges, independent retailers, national retailers and corporate owned retail stores. During 2017, the Company substantially completed the uniform branding of all of its tractors with the SpartanNash logo and tagline “Taking Food Places.” In addition, the Company continues to add lift gates to its existing fleet in order to better service a more diverse group of customers.
 Reporting Segment Financial Data and Products 
 Refer to the segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the Company’s sales by type of similar products and services. All of the Company’s sales and assets are in the United States of America. Consolidated net sales include the net sales of its Food Distribution business, which exclude sales to corporate owned retail stores, the net sales of its Military segment, and the net sales of its corporate owned retail store and fuel centers in its Retail segment.
Discontinued Operations 
 Certain of the Company’s Food Distribution and Retail operations have been recorded as discontinued operations. Discontinued operations consist of certain locations that have been closed or sold. 
Marketing and Merchandising 
 General. The Company continues to align its marketing and merchandising strategies with current consumer behaviors by delivering initiatives centered on personalization, value beyond price, affordable wellness, local focus and social responsibility – all designed to deliver a superior shopping experience for customers. During 2017, the Company refreshed its brand positioning for Family Fare, its primary Retail banner, to incorporate these areas of focus. These strategies seek to use consumer data and insights to deliver products, promotions, content and experiences to satisfy the consumer’s needs. 
 The Company believes that data from its “yes” loyalty program gives it competitive insight into consumer shopping behavior. This gives the Company the flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing conditions by making tactical and more effective adjustments to its marketing and merchandising programs. As investments are made to remodel and/or rebanner various stores, the Company continues to roll out the “yes” program to expand its knowledge of its customers and to provide its loyalty rewards in additional markets.
 The Company’s investment to further strengthen its knowledge of the consumer has continued to drive process improvements in several areas: creation of a robust self-serve data tool that enables category managers to make consumer centric merchandising and marketing decisions; continuous refinement of Key Value Items (“KVI”) analyses that align pricing for the most price sensitive items with the most price sensitive customer segments; the development of a customer strategy that will be used to guide its internal business processes and go-to market strategy; and the evolution of its customer segmentation that takes it beyond the purchase and transactional behavior to lifestyle. These initiatives better position the Company to deliver a shopping experience that constantly responds to the ever-changing needs of its consumers.

The Company has been building tools and capabilities to enable relevant, personalized content across its marketing channels and focusing on expanding its digital, social and mobile capabilities. New mobile apps specific to each Retail banner were recently launched, providing consumers with the ability to view store ads, create shopping lists, shop via Fast Lane, clip coupons, and join virtual shopping clubs, all from their mobile device. This will help the Company further build longer-term customer loyalty through convenience and value, maintain efficient marketing spend and increase return on investment, improve its sales growth opportunities, and further strengthen its business position. As the Company continues to build these capabilities, along with its other strategies, the Company will continue to share its marketing and merchandising learnings and best practices across its wholesale customer base.
 In addition to sharing the expertise gained in its Retail operations, the Company differentiates itself from its competitors by offering a full set of value added support services to its Food Distribution customers. These services, which are further described above, help the independent retailers to operate and compete effectively, and many of them are not offered by the Company’s competition.
 As the Company works to better differentiate its Retail stores and roll out its refreshed brand positioning, the Company is selectively adding products and services to better meet customers’ changing needs. For instance, the Company is adding full service meat and seafood departments which include many items handmade in store, and has added produce preparation services, smokehouses, expanded beer and wine selections, and other offerings to certain stores to enhance the customers’ experience. The Company has been adding signage and improved displays in departments such as pet products, laundry, and snacks in order to improve foot traffic in these aisles and drive sales. The Company continues to add fuel centers and Starbucks Coffee or Caribou Coffee shops in certain corporate owned retail stores, and also provides consumers with fuel purchase discounts at fuel centers through its corporate owned retail stores or by partnering with third party fuel centers.
 As consumers increasingly emphasize affordable wellness, the Company believes that it can be a provider and resource for products and services that will support their needs. In 2017, the Company continued to expand its offerings and partnerships and undertook the following key initiatives. First, the Company continued to expand its “Living Well” product offerings through in-line merchandising concepts. Second, the Company established partnerships with health systems and providers to provide wellness specialists-led store tours to help educate consumers to make healthier food choices. Third, the Company increased its retail product offering and assortment for organic, gluten-free, meat-free, non-GMO products and other healthier food options. Finally, the Company offers a best in class pharmacy program, including $4 and $10 generics and free diabetic and prenatal prescriptions.
 In support of its commitment to local products and caring for the community and environment, the Company is proud to work with local farmers and vendors to provide locally grown produce and products in many of its stores. The Company offers a significant selection of local products in many of its stores, well in excess of most of its competitors’ offerings. In some of its stores the Company collects items from customers for recycling, and the Company has been recognized as a best in class recycler of its own waste. Also, in an effort to reduce costs and reduce its environmental footprint, the Company has many initiatives to reduce energy usage, including the installation of energy efficient lighting and refrigeration in its stores.
 Private Brands. SpartanNash provides a best in class private brand program, offering a full line of proprietary and licensed private brands in its corporate owned retail stores and its independent retailer customers, as well as partnering with DeCA in the design and launch of its military private brands. SpartanNash believes that its private brand offerings are some of its most valuable strategic assets, demonstrated through customer loyalty and profitability. The Company continues to invest in improvements to its private brands by offering quality, value, and assortment, and believes the success of its private brands to be of vital importance. The Company’s products have been frequently recognized for excellence in packaging design and product development.
 The Company continues to enhance its private brand programs for both independent customers and corporate owned retail stores, and in 2017, launched its Our Family® private brand into its Michigan stores. The transition from the Spartan™ brand to Our Family® provides the Company with a system-wide, national brand equivalent or better quality program, as well as allows the Company to streamline its supply chain to deliver a larger variety of product offerings at a lower cost to consumers. The transition to Our Family® as the Company’s primary private brand is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018. Also in 2017, the Company began incorporating its own fresh-cut fruits and vegetables into the Open Acres™ private brand, which supports the Company’s living well offering. Additionally, Eternal Oceans™ was launched as the Company’s sustainability initiative for seafood within the Open Acres™ brand. SpartanNash also launched a product declaration “free from” initiative, with a goal of assigning brand specific bullets alerting consumers of certain undesirable ingredients that have been eliminated, creating a “cleaner” product offering. The Company expects this program to continue throughout 2018 and become core to the Company’s product development principles in all future development. The Company plans to introduce approximately 350 additional new items in 2018 throughout its private brand portfolio, which includes the rollout of the Good to Go™ meal solutions program. 
 SpartanNash currently markets and distributes private brand items primarily under the following brands: Our Family® (national brand equivalent or better grocery products); Open Acres™ (fresh products); Top Care (health and beauty care); Tippy Toes (baby); Full Circle™ (organic and wellness); Culinary Tours™ (premium quality foods); PAWS Premium (pet supplies); and Valu Time (value). SpartanNash is also the exclusive worldwide distributor of DeCA’s private brands, Freedom’s Choice® and Home Base®.

Competition 
 The Company’s Food Distribution, Military and Retail segments operate in a highly competitive industry, which typically results in low profit margins for the industry as a whole. The Company competes with, among others, regional and national grocery distributors, large chain stores that have integrated wholesale and retail operations, mass merchandisers, e-commerce providers, deep discount retailers, limited assortment stores and wholesale membership clubs, many of whom have greater resources than the Company. The Company also faces competition from rapidly growing alternative retail channels, such as dollar stores, discount supermarket chains, Internet-based retailers and meal-delivery services.
 Food Distribution competes directly with a number of traditional and specialty grocery wholesalers and retailers that maintain or develop self-distribution systems for the business of independent grocery retailers. In addition, the Company’s independent customers face intense competition from supercenters, deep discounters, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, and e-commerce providers. The Company partners with its customers to help them compete effectively. The primary competitive factors in the Food Distribution business include price, service, product quality, variety and other value-added services. The Company believes its overall service level, which is defined as actual units shipped divided by actual units ordered, is among industry leaders in terms of performance. 
 The Company is one of ten or fewer distributors in the United States with annual sales to the DeCA commissary system in excess of $100 million that distributes products via the frequent delivery system. The remaining distributors that supply DeCA tend to be smaller regional and local providers. In addition, manufacturers contract with others to deliver certain products, such as baking supplies, produce, delicatessen items, soft drinks and snack items, directly to DeCA commissaries and service exchanges. Because of the narrow margins in this industry, it is of critical importance for distributors to achieve economies of scale, which is typically a function of the density or concentration of military bases within the geographic area(s) a distributor serves. As a result, no single distributor in this industry, by itself, has a nationwide presence. Rather, distributors tend to concentrate on specific regions, or areas within specific regions, where they can achieve critical mass and utilize warehouse and distribution facilities efficiently. In addition, distributors that operate larger non-military specific distribution businesses tend to compete for DeCA commissary business in areas where such business would enable them to more efficiently utilize the capacity of their existing distribution centers. The Company believes the principal competitive factors among distributors within this industry are customer service, price, operating efficiencies, reputation with DeCA and location of distribution centers. The Company believes its competitive position is strong with respect to all of these factors within the geographic areas where it competes.
 Despite the ongoing commissary sales challenges, the Company has been working diligently to realize opportunities and has expanded vendor relationships to new military bases and continues to roll out the Company’s private brand product offerings. The Company believes that the private brand offering, when fully executed, will drive more traffic and business into the commissaries as a whole. By providing a combination of national and private brand products, the commissaries are offering one-stop shopping for military customers, which should benefit all of the constituents of the DeCA system.
 The principal competitive factors in the retail grocery business include the location and image of the store; the price, quality and variety of the perishable products; and the quality, convenience and consistency of service. In addition to competing with traditional grocery stores, the Company competes with supercenters, deep discounters, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, and e-commerce providers. The Company believes it has developed and implemented strategies and processes that allow it to be competitive in its Retail segment by providing convenience, customer experience, and the assortment consumers want. The Company monitors planned competitor store openings and uses established proactive strategies to respond to new competition both before and after the competitive store opening. Strategies to react to competition vary based on many factors, such as the competitor’s format, strengths, weaknesses, pricing and sales focus. During the past three fiscal years, nine competitor supercenters opened in geographic areas in which the Company currently operates corporate owned retail stores with four additional openings expected to occur during 2018. As a result of these openings, the Company believes the majority of its supermarkets compete with one or more supercenters. The Company is also responding to growing competition from online and non-traditional retailers by adding new options and services such as Fast Lane, its new online ordering and curbside pick-up service, as well as home delivery.
 Seasonality 
 In certain geographic areas, the Company’s sales and operating performance varies with seasonality. Many stores are dependent on tourism, and therefore, are most affected by seasons and weather patterns, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of snowfall during the winter months and the range of temperature during the summer months. All fiscal quarters are 12 weeks, except for the Company’s first quarter, which is 16 weeks and will generally include the Easter holiday. The fourth quarter includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and depending on the fiscal year end, may include the New Year’s holiday.
 -9-

Suppliers 
 The Company purchases products from a large number of national, regional and local suppliers of name brand and private brand merchandise.

 Supply Chain. During 2017, the Company continued to implement the standard order management system, which is expected to be completed in 2018. Standardization of the inventory management, distribution pricing and invoicing system was also initiated in 2017 with an anticipated completion date of 2019. The Company completed the implementation of a new environmental integrity monitoring system for the transportation fleet, implemented technology support associated with Food Safety Modernization Act requirements and has successfully converted more than half of the Company’s independent customers to state-of-the-art Business-to-Business technology. 
 Retail Systems. The Company implemented Fast Lane, a click-and-collect grocery ordering system, in approximately 40 corporate owned retail stores and is currently testing delivery in two locations. Fast Lane will continue to be deployed in additional stores in 2018. The Company enhanced its electronic payment system to support chip and pin/signature cards in all retail locations and also implemented a new back-end processing system. The Company also completed technology support for new Nutrition Labeling requirements, and is in the final testing phase of a major upgrade to its digital mobile application for customer use. The Company began the testing of a major upgrade and replacement of the computer-assisted ordering system used in the corporate retail locations, and also initiated preparations for testing a 2018 pilot of a major upgrade to the Point-of-Sale software.
 Administrative Systems and Infrastructure. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company completed the consolidation of the accounts receivable system from the Nash-Finch merger. Additionally, the general ledger, fixed asset systems, EDI processing, payroll, labor management and human resources systems were standardized as part of the Caito integration. Additional upgrades to the infrastructure in the primary and back up data centers were also completed to improve the flexibility of disaster recovery and non-stop processing.
