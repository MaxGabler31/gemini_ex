ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

Overview
Kontoor Brands, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, "Kontoor," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") is a global lifestyle apparel company, with a portfolio led by two of the world’s most iconic consumer brands: Wrangler® and Lee®. We completed a spin-off transaction from VF Corporation ("VF" or "former parent") on May 22, 2019 (the "Separation") and began to trade as a standalone public company (NYSE: KTB) on May 23, 2019.
The Company designs, produces, procures, markets and distributes apparel primarily under the brand names Wrangler® and Lee®. The Company’s products are sold in the United States (“U.S.”) through mass merchants, specialty stores, mid-tier and traditional department stores, company-operated stores and online. The Company’s products are also sold internationally, primarily in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions, through department, specialty, company-operated, concession retail and independently-operated partnership stores and online. 
Kontoor is headquartered in the U.S. with a presence in over 70 countries. Our primary brands, Wrangler® and Lee®, benefit from heritages spanning over 200 combined years and together with our other brands accounted for approximately 152 million units of apparel sold in 2021. We sell our products primarily through our established wholesale and expanding digital ecosystems, supplemented through our branded brick & mortar locations. We benefit from strong relationships with many of our customers who we believe depend on our ability to reliably and timely replenish our high-volume products.
We focus on continuously improving the most important elements of our products, which include fit, fabric, finish and overall construction, while continuing to provide our products to consumers at attractive price points. We leverage innovation and design advancements as well as our unique brand heritages to create products that meet our consumers' needs.

The Company operates and reports using a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. For presentation purposes herein, all references to periods ended December 2021, December 2020 and December 2019 correspond to the 52-week fiscal year ended January 1, 2022, the 53-week fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 and the 52-week fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, respectively. 
Impact of COVID-19 and Other Recent Developments
The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic continues to impact global economic conditions, as well as the Company's operations. COVID-19 had a meaningful negative impact on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations during 2020, as revenues declined and we reduced spending in light of COVID-19 uncertainty. Although we continued to experience disruption and volatility, our revenues nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, reflecting the lesser impact of COVID-19 and the strength and resiliency of our customers and brands. Accordingly, our comparisons between 2021 and 2020 were significantly impacted by the lower revenues and expenses in 2020. 
We continue to monitor safety protocols and health precautions as we operate our facilities. The Company’s offices are open where permitted by local restrictions and deemed appropriate by management, but many associates continue to work remotely. The Company’s manufacturing plants and distribution centers around the world are currently operating, and we have continued to experience retail store closures and reduced traffic in various countries during 2021. 
 We continue to experience delays in product and raw material availability due largely to global supply chain disruptions, driven in part by port congestion and transportation delays. We are working with our customers to minimize any impact, and have incurred transitory costs, including air freight to expedite shipments to meet customer demand, primarily during the second half of 2021.
The ultimate economic impact of the pandemic remains fluid, and there continue to be periods of COVID-19 resurgence in various parts of the world. While we anticipate the potential for additional periods of disruption and volatility during 2022, we believe that we are appropriately positioned to successfully manage through any associated operational challenges resulting from a prolonged COVID-19 operating environment.

Our Competitive Strengths
•Iconic Brands With Significant Global Scale
The Wrangler® and Lee® brands are steeped in rich heritage and authenticity, with 75 years and 133 years of history, respectively, and have an established global presence in the apparel market. Products bearing our brands are sold in more than 70 countries, and we believe they have strong consumer connectivity worldwide. We market our brands and products to highlight their differentiated position and product attributes. We sit at the center of cultural moments and cater broadly to customers through our licensed collaborations, such as Yellowstone, Billabong, Pendleton, Forbidden City, The Hundreds, Keith Haring, Bob Marley, Stranger Things and Rick and Morty, among others. We strive to maximize our consumer reach by leveraging each brand’s best practices to drive growth across product categories and expand our overall net revenues and earnings profile.
•Deep Relationships With Leading Global Brick & Mortar and E-Commerce Retailers
We have developed long-term relationships with many leading global brick & mortar and e-commerce retailers, including Amazon, Kohl’s, Target and Walmart, whom we believe rely on our iconic brands, leading product quality and value, and innovation to address evolving consumer needs in our product categories. We foster close and long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers, having partnered with each of our top three brick & mortar wholesale customers for over 30 years and with Amazon for over 15 years. Our rich global heritage across both the Wrangler® and Lee® brands also supports strong positions in growing markets, such as in the U.S. Western specialty channel and with leading retailers in China. By fostering these relationships, we have become an important vendor for many of our customers and have built leading category positions, which in turn supports the availability of our brands to consumers and our ability to introduce new products and categories. We also endeavor to provide sophisticated logistics, planning, and merchandising expertise to support our customers, which we believe enables a level of insight that builds more integrated customer relationships. 
2 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2021 Form 10-K


•Integrated Supply Chain Built to Support Volume and Replenishment
We are continually refining our supply chain to maximize efficiency and reinforce our reputation of reliability with our customers. Through our vertically integrated supply chain, we manufacture, source and distribute a significant quantity of high-volume apparel products that are frequently replenished by our retail partners. Our product procurement and distribution strategies, combined with our internal manufacturing facilities and retail floor space management programs, create increased operating flexibility. Our supply chain is built to support large volumes and to meet customer needs while balancing cost and operational requirements. Our internal manufacturing facilities are all located in the Western Hemisphere where their proximity to our primary markets enables us to deliver inventory in a consistent and timely manner. We also have established global third-party sourcing and distribution networks that we leverage across product categories and various regions. We currently have three sample development centers located in North Carolina, South China and Bangladesh. We believe our flexible and balanced approach to manufacturing and distribution allows us to better manage our production needs and to support expanded digital distribution. Additionally, we expect that our investment and implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, completed in mid-2021, will deliver global cost savings, reduce complexity in our supply chain, create better inventory management and improve our speed in the market. 
•Highly Experienced Management Team and Board of Directors
We have a highly experienced senior management team that continuously demonstrates an unwavering commitment to our employees, our shareholders and our business. Drawing on the management team’s deep industry knowledge and diverse perspectives, they have helped navigate our business through unprecedented challenges spurred by a global pandemic, while simultaneously evolving our purpose-led strategies with agility and flexibility. In 2019, we appointed the first ever Global Design Heads for both the Wrangler® and Lee® brands, and in 2020, we hired our first Global Digital Head. As we embark on a transformational period focused on catalyzing growth for our global brands, we believe our management team and Board of Directors will continue to drive the success of our company. 
•Resilient Business Model That Delivers Consistent Results
Although COVID-19 had a meaningful negative impact on our business, cash flows and results of operations in 2020, and continues to impact global economic conditions, our business has historically generated consistent margins and strong cash flows due to our global reach, leading market positions, deep customer relationships, and the vertical integration of our supply chain. We believe we offer high product value and quality to our consumers, who respond to our value proposition by consistently purchasing our products over time. Our strong margin profile combined with our diligent approach to operational excellence and capital management have produced meaningful cash flows. We believe our consistent financial results will provide us with the opportunity to consistently invest in our business and deploy a multi-faceted capital allocation strategy. 
Our Strategies
Our management team continues to focus on the long-term strategic initiatives we introduced after separation as a standalone public company. 
During Horizon 1, or the first 18-24 months as a standalone public company, we established a healthier foundation for profitable growth. This was supported by streamlining our global operations, migrating to a new technology platform, enhancing gross margin through improving quality of sales and de-levering our balance sheet.
At our Investor Day in 2021, we introduced our Horizon 2 multi-year strategic vision, Catalyzing Growth. Over the next three years, we will be sharply focused on driving brand growth and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders including our consumers, customers, shareholders, suppliers and the communities where we do business around the world. We are focused on the following four areas that we believe will catalyze profitable revenue growth in the future:
•Enhance and Accelerate Our Core U.S. Wholesale Business
We are focused on continuing to enhance the global strength of our brands, improve operating efficiency and increase the overall demand for our products. Within our largest market and channel, we are pursuing strategies to support and grow market share in existing distribution with leading retailers, drive business opportunities in new channels, such as premium, specialty and sporting goods, as well as accelerate complementary categories.
•Diversify Our Product Mix Through Category Extensions, Including Outdoor, Workwear and T-shirts
We continue to enhance our existing product assortment, broaden our product offering and expand into adjacent product categories, with a focus on outdoor, workwear and t-shirts. Within outdoor, we are bringing to market new product innovation platforms such as the Wrangler® outdoor collection, All Terrain GearTM, as well as the recently announced Wrangler® AnglerTM collection. Within workwear, we are leveraging our strong brand equity and innovation platforms to enter new markets and categories. And in t‑shirts, we are focusing our efforts across logo, lifestyle and licensed/collaboration content. Successful execution of our product expansion strategies should broaden the appeal of our brands and products to new consumers and ultimately drive the overall net revenues of the business.

•Expand Our Reach Around the Globe, Prioritizing Opportunities Within the China and Europe Regions
We continue to pursue opportunities to expand the distribution of our products with new and existing customers internationally. Leveraging our leading market position with Lee® in the China region, we launched our Wrangler® brand on a digital platform in China in December 2020. We have expanded this collection and our marketing efforts in 2021, and opened our first retail store in China during November 2021. In Europe, we intend to refine our strategy to become more consumer-centric in addressing how and where our customers want to purchase our products, beginning with our new e-commerce sites launched in 2020, as well as numerous opportunities to expand points of distribution. Wrangler®, which is currently approximately 90% U.S. domestic, has many international growth opportunities, particularly in China and Europe.
•Elevate Our Direct Connection With Consumers Through Channel Expansion, Focused on Evolving the Company’s Direct-to-consumer and Digital Ecosystem
We expect to leverage our leading brand positions to increase our digital penetration with our own e‑commerce websites as well as major global retail partners, as we continue to evolve our digital ecosystem. We are making progress towards these objectives through amplified investments in advanced data analytics capabilities and unlocking new value through our global ERP infrastructure.
In support of these long-term growth opportunities, we are stepping up our investment in accretive enablers:
•Product & design - transforming the brands in the marketplace with elevated global designs
•Innovation - exploring next-generation technologies to continue to propel the Wrangler® and Lee® brands
•Supply chain - driving future productivity gains and improved service and agility with supply partners
•Talent & culture - promoting an inclusive, growth-minded, high-performing culture
•Demand creation - activating the brands through new marketing and creative expressions

•Other
Other primarily includes other revenue sources, including sales and licensing of Rock & Republic® apparel. Rock & Republic® is a premium apparel brand and is marketed to consumers as a modern and active lifestyle brand. We distribute the brand in the U.S. and Canada by leveraging our retail and e-commerce relationships. Other also included sales of third-party branded merchandise at VF Outlet stores through the first quarter of 2021. 
Distribution Channels and Customers
Our distribution channels include U.S. Wholesale, Non-U.S. Wholesale, Direct-to-Consumer and Other.
•U.S. Wholesale
The U.S. Wholesale channel is our largest distribution channel and accounted for approximately 69% of our net revenues in 2021. Within this channel, our Wrangler® and Lee® branded products are marketed and sold by mass and mid-tier retailers, specialty stores including western specialty retail, department stores and retailer-owned and third-party e-commerce sites. This channel also includes revenues related to Rock & Republic® products sold in the U.S. A portion of our U.S. Wholesale net revenue is attributable to digital sales from our wholesale partners’ websites, third-party e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, and other pure-play digital retailers. Third-party e-commerce platforms and pure-play digital retailers are a growing and important portion of this channel.
Our mass merchant customers include national retailers such as Target and Walmart, as well as various regional retail partners. Our mid-tier and traditional department store customers include national retailers such as Kohl’s and Nordstrom as well as other retail partners. The specialty store channel, which includes revenue from Wrangler® Riggs Workwear® and Wrangler® Western branded products, consists primarily of national accounts such as Boot Barn and Tractor Supply Company as well as upscale modern specialty stores.
We foster close and longstanding relationships with our wholesale customers, having partnered with each of our top three brick & mortar wholesale customers for over 30 years. In addition, we engage in an active dialogue with many of our key wholesale customers and receive proprietary insights about how our products are performing on a timely basis. Our brands’ top U.S. Wholesale customers include Amazon, Kohl’s, Target and Walmart. Sales to Walmart as a percentage of total revenues were approximately 34% in 2021, 38% in 2020 and 34% in 2019.
In addition, a small portion of sales in our U.S. Wholesale channel are from domestic licensing arrangements where we receive royalties based on a percentage of the licensed products’ net revenues. Most of the agreements provide for a minimum royalty requirement. See “Licensing Arrangements” herein for more information.
•Non-U.S. Wholesale
The Non-U.S. Wholesale channel represents the majority of our international business and accounted for approximately 20% of our net revenues in 2021. The majority of the Wrangler® and Lee® international product business is located in EMEA and APAC, where we sell our products directly to our department store and specialty store wholesale customers, and indirectly through our distribution and license relationships. This channel also includes revenues related to Rock & Republic® products sold in Canada. In Canada and Mexico, our products are marketed through mass merchants, department stores and specialty stores. Additionally, our Non-U.S. Wholesale channel includes non-U.S. sales on digital platforms operated by our wholesale customers, as well as sales in partnership stores located across EMEA, APAC and South America. Partnership stores are owned and operated by our licensees, distributors and other independent parties. They are retail locations selling our Wrangler® and Lee® branded products that have the appearance of Kontoor-operated stores, and as such represent an important vehicle for presenting our brands to international consumers. Similar to the U.S. Wholesale channel, we use proprietary insights from our wholesale customers to strategically refine our products and adjust our go-to-market approach.
Geographically, our net revenue in EMEA is concentrated in developed markets such as France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Scandinavia, Spain and the United Kingdom. We access the APAC market primarily through our business in China. Canada is the largest international market for Wrangler® branded products, while China is the largest international market for Lee® branded products.
In addition, a small portion of sales in our Non-U.S. Wholesale channel are from international licensing arrangements where we receive royalties based on a percentage of the licensed products’ net revenues. Most of the agreements provide for a minimum royalty requirement. See “Licensing Arrangements” herein for more information.
•Direct-to-Consumer
Our Direct-to-Consumer channel accounted for approximately 11% of our net revenues in 2021 and represents the distribution of our products via our Wrangler® and Lee® branded full-price stores and Company-operated outlet stores globally, as well as digital sales generated globally from our own websites, including www.wrangler.com and www.lee.com, and concession retail locations internationally. 
5 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K


The Direct-to-Consumer channel allows us to achieve the fullest expression of our brands by displaying our product lines in a manner that supports the brands’ positioning, providing an in-store and online user experience that enables us to address the needs and preferences of our consumers. 
As of January 1, 2022, we had 25 Company-operated full-price Wrangler® and Lee® branded retail stores, which are located in Asia, Europe and the U.S. They include both mono-brand stores, which exclusively carry either Wrangler® or Lee® branded products, and dual-brand stores, which carry both Wrangler® and Lee® branded products. We also had 55 Company-operated outlet and clearance centers as of January 1, 2022, primarily our Lee Wrangler OutletTM and Lee Wrangler Clearance CenterTM retail stores located in the U.S., as well as locations in Europe, Mexico and Asia. 
As of January 1, 2022, we had 217 concession retail stores in Europe and Asia. Under a typical concession arrangement, we have a dedicated sales area and pay a concession fee for use of the space based on a percentage of retail sales. The concession model provides dedicated sales areas for our brands and helps differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products, generally without incurring the full overhead of opening a separate store.
We continue to prioritize serving our customers through digital platforms that enhance the user experience and drive customer interaction in digital and physical environments. Digitally-enabled transactions generated from our own websites represent a growing portion of our net revenues, and help elevate the connection consumers have with our brands. Wrangler® and Lee® branded products are currently available through our own websites in 15 countries.
•Other
Other included sales of third-party branded merchandise at VF Outlet stores through the first quarter of 2021. The Other channel accounted for less than 1% of our net revenues in 2021.
Licensing Arrangements
We seek to maximize our brands’ market penetration and consumer reach by entering into licensing agreements with independent parties. Pursuant to these licensing agreements, we typically grant our licensing partner an exclusive or non-exclusive license to use one or more of our brands in connection with specific licensed categories of products in specific geographic regions. Our licensing partners leverage the strength of our brands and our customer relationships to sell products in their licensed categories and geographic regions. We currently have licensing agreements in categories including jeanswear, casual apparel, belts, footwear, small leather goods, headwear, socks, home décor, luggage, bags, watches, eyewear and cold weather accessories.
We retain oversight and approvals of the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products to help maintain our brand and product quality standards. License agreements are for fixed terms of typically two to five years. Each licensee pays royalties based on its sales of licensed products, with the majority of agreements requiring a minimum royalty payment. Licensing net revenue was $26.6 million in 2021.
Design, Product Development and Innovation 
Our devotion to creative excellence in design, product development and innovation is the foundation of our product strategy. We focus our extensive experience and know-how to create the unique combination of world-class value, quality and styling for our consumers. We operate a multi-site approach for design and product development, with supporting functions in the U.S., Belgium and Hong Kong. These creative teams collaborate globally with the merchandising, marketing, planning, consumer insights and executive teams to ensure product delivers against brand positioning, consumer needs and cost requirements. We have two primary selling seasons, Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter, although some product lines are offered more frequently.
In addition to our global design and product development functions, we operate an innovation center in Greensboro, North Carolina. Research for advanced fiber and fabric technology takes place in our dedicated material science lab. Research and development for garment construction, laser processing and wash finishing advancement takes place in our design center. These locations are staffed with dedicated scientists, engineers and designers who leverage our consumer insights to create new designs and manufacturing and material technologies. Our innovation network is integral to our design approach and our long-term growth as it allows us to deliver products and experiences to meet our consumer needs. 
Manufacturing, Sourcing and Distribution
Our global supply chain organization is responsible for the operational planning, manufacturing, sourcing and distribution of products to our customers. We believe we have developed a high degree of expertise in managing the complexities associated with a global supply chain that produced or sourced approximately 151 million units of apparel in 2021. Our supply chain employs a centralized leadership model with localized regional expertise. Within our internal manufacturing facilities, we innovate and design proprietary equipment to drive our production output and capabilities. We focus on engineering and efficiency, which we believe provides an ongoing competitive advantage in our internal manufacturing facilities. We leverage our manufacturing expertise in our sourcing operations, where we have developed longstanding relationships with third-party contract manufacturers and distributors. We believe this manufacturing and sourcing approach, coupled with strategic inventory and retail floor space management programs with many of our major retail customers, gives us operational flexibility as we continue to expand our distribution. 
6 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2021 Form 10-K


 We continue to experience delays in product and raw material availability due largely to global supply chain disruptions, driven in part by port congestion and transportation delays. We are working with our customers to minimize any impact, and have incurred transitory costs, including air freight to expedite shipments to meet customer demand, primarily during the second half of 2021.
•Sourcing and Manufacturing
We believe the combination of our internal manufacturing and contract manufacturing across different geographic regions provides a well-balanced, flexible approach to product procurement. Within our own manufacturing facilities, we purchase raw materials from numerous U.S. and international suppliers to meet our production needs. Raw materials include products made from cotton, polyester, spandex and lycra blends, as well as thread and trim (such as product identification, buttons, zippers and snaps). Fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are typically set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases. No single supplier represents more than 10% of our total cost of goods sold. We operate global sourcing hubs, which are responsible for managing contract manufacturing and procurement of product, including supplier oversight, product quality assurance, sustainability within the supply chain, responsible sourcing, and transportation and shipping functions.
We operate ten manufacturing facilities, comprised of seven owned facilities in Mexico and three leased facilities in Nicaragua. We also source products from approximately 200 contract manufacturing facilities in 19 countries. During 2021, approximately 35% of our units were manufactured in our internal manufacturing facilities, and approximately 65% were sourced from contract manufacturers. Products obtained from contractors in the Western Hemisphere frequently have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in Asia. However, internal manufacturing combined with contracting in the Western Hemisphere gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and allows for enhanced inventory management in the U.S. market. In making decisions about the location of manufacturing operations and suppliers, we consider several factors including the raw material source, the market the product will be sold in, production lead times, duties and tariffs, product cost, product complexity and the ability to pursue upside demand. Additionally, we continually monitor risks and developments related to duties, tariffs, quotas and other factors and we often manufacture and source products from countries with tariff preferences and free trade agreements.
•Distribution
Products are shipped from our contract manufacturers and internal manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the world. We directly operate our domestic distribution centers and we carefully select third-party logistic providers as needed in certain regions. All of our distribution centers are strategically located to provide speed and service to our consumers at the most efficient cost possible. Additionally, our established long-term third-party distribution relationships ensure maximum capacity, connectivity, responsiveness and overall service coverage around the globe. In international markets where we do not have brick & mortar or wholesale operations, our products are marketed through our distributors, as well as agents, licensees and branded partnership stores.
Inventory Management 
Inventory management is key to the cash flows and operating results of our business. We manage our inventory levels based on existing orders, anticipated sales and the delivery requirements of our customers, which requires close coordination with our customers. For new product introductions, which often require large initial launch shipments, we may commence production before receiving orders for those products. Key areas of focus include added discipline around the purchasing of product, inventory optimization and channel placement, as well as better planning and execution in disposition of excess inventory through our various channels. Our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand, while improving our inventory efficiency over the long-term through the recent implementation of the Company's global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system and inventory optimization tools. 
Advertising and Customer Support
Our advertising and marketing efforts focus on differentiating our brands’ positioning and highlighting our product qualities. We are focused on creating globally unified brand messages with appropriate regional nuances in order to maximize our brand recognition, and drive brand demand from initial end consumer awareness to long-term loyalty. By utilizing global heads of marketing, we will continue to develop integrated, multi-channel marketing strategies designed to effectively reach the target consumers of each of our brands. We pursue this strategy through our use of a variety of media channels and other public endorsements, including traditional media such as television, print and radio, as well as digital media channels such as display, online video, social media, live streaming, paid search and influencers. We leverage marketing analytics to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending, and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments. Our strategy also includes collaborating with new brands and developing new advertising campaigns that drive consumer awareness and brand equity.
We also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media, radio and television. We generally provide advertising support to our wholesale customers in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products. Our websites, www.wrangler.com, www.lee.com and corresponding regional websites, enhance consumer understanding of our brands and help consumers find and buy our products. We employ a support team for each brand that is responsible for customer service at the consumer level as well as a sales force that manages our customer relationships.

Seasonality
Absent the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and timing shifts due to our ERP implementation in 2021, our operating results are generally subject to some variability due to seasonality, with net revenues typically being slightly higher during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. This limited variation results primarily from the differences in seasonal influences on revenues between our Wrangler® and Lee® segments. With changes in our mix of business and the growth of our direct-to-consumer operations, historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends. Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital typically increases early in the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Cash provided by operating activities is usually substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements.
Competition 
The apparel industry is highly competitive, highly fragmented and characterized by low barriers to entry with many local, regional and global competitors. We compete in the apparel and accessories sector by leveraging our brands, scale and ability to develop high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices that meet consumer needs.
Our primary branded competitors are large, globally focused apparel companies that also participate in a variety of categories, including, but not limited to, athletic wear, denim, exclusive or private labels, casual lifestyle apparel, outerwear and workwear. A select list of key competitors includes Calvin Klein, Carhartt, Diesel, Guess, Levi’s, Tommy Hilfiger and Uniqlo. Additionally, we see a large and growing offering from private label apparel created for retailers such as Amazon, Target and Walmart.
Intellectual Property
Trademarks, trade names, patents and domain names, as well as related logos, designs and graphics, provide substantial value in the development and marketing of our products, and are important to our continued success. We have registered our intellectual property in the U.S. and in other countries where our products are manufactured and/or sold. In particular, our trademark portfolio consists of over 7,500 trademark registrations and applications in the U.S. and other countries around the world, including U.S. and foreign trademark registrations for our two key brands, Wrangler® and Lee®. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, in general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable provided that the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. Typically, trademark registrations can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We also place high importance on product innovation and design, and a number of these innovations and designs are the subject of patents. However, we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.
 Human Capital
We understand that our greatest asset is our global employee base. As of January 1, 2022, we had approximately 14,000 employees worldwide. Geographically, approximately 1,000 employees are located in APAC, approximately 600 are located in EMEA, approximately 9,900 are located in Latin America and Mexico, and approximately 2,800 are located in the U.S. In international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by trade sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be good.
Supported by a leadership team with deep experience in nurturing vibrant brands that break new ground and inspire consumer loyalty, our employees bring a sense of pride in our rich heritage and an entrepreneurial spirit towards creating our future. Together, they are dedicated to creating quality apparel that is woven with care, style and sensitivity to our planet. This dedicated collaboration is at the core foundation of trust that drives our company’s high-performance culture and our business success. 
•Growth Culture
We are dedicated to putting our purpose, mission and values at the forefront of everything we do. They serve as our north star, guiding us on our journey and in our decisions to make a positive impact on the world and each other. 
In 2021, we aligned our cultural aspirations and our purpose, mission and values to our new growth strategy as we entered into Kontoor’s growth horizon. We will continue to expand our existing approach to embed our purpose, mission and values across all of our talent processes that enable each employee to live by the core behavioral elements of our values.
•Inclusion, Diversity and Equity
We continue to focus on the impact we can make as a company, and our strategic priorities are reflected in the Inclusion & Diversity Progress Report we published in 2021, focusing on Workplace Belonging, Workforce Diversity, Marketplace Equity and Sustainability & Accountability. We’ve done important work with our brands, conducting a comprehensive marketing audit to establish a baseline of inclusion measures, which are now part of every consumer touchpoint.
As we work to grow our understanding of how to engage through an Inclusion & Diversity lens, Kontoor offers employees tools that incorporate Inclusion & Diversity into our learning culture and philosophy. The Cultural Foundations program, available to all employees through Workday, includes a “Creating an Inclusive Environment” course designed to build greater knowledge about how

to contribute to the development of a truly inclusive workplace. During 2021, the Company introduced a new feedback tool, based in our values, which reports that 90% of feedback providers (employees who have elected to participate) indicate their managers value diversity. We also added a platform offering micro-learning opportunities, which reports that 31% of all content accessed by users is focused on Inclusion & Diversity.
Our employees continue to contribute to building a community where everyone can feel valued. Our many varied Employee Resource Groups have sponsored events throughout the last year, educating and connecting us, including a lunch and learn for Juneteenth, and belonging opportunities designed to connect colleagues in a virtual work world. We hosted forums to foster dialogue, reflection and understanding one year after the racial injustice occurrences of 2020. 
•Workplace Health & Safety
We prioritize the health, safety and fair treatment of our employees and those who help produce our products. We take the health, safety and well-being of individuals seriously and are committed to only working with supply chain partners who uphold our same standards. In addition to our policies and standards, we often work with contract supplier factories to go beyond worker health and safety to provide opportunities to their surrounding communities like BSR’s HERproject™, a collaborative initiative that strives to empower low-income women working in global supply chains.
Our commitment to safety was evident in the actions and steps we swiftly took in our response to COVID-19, which continued throughout 2021. We established a COVID-19 cross-functional task force that aligned our efforts and decisions on our response and have expanded the mental health resources available to employees globally. 
Social Responsibility, Community Outreach and Sustainability
We are a purpose-led organization and are committed to environmental sustainability, labor welfare and community development, not only because today’s consumers demand the highest standards from the brands they utilize, but because we believe these values are consistent with what our brands represent and are the right thing to do to enhance global welfare. Corporate sustainability and responsibility is an important priority for the Company and the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is responsible for promoting the exercise of responsible corporate citizenship and monitoring adherence to Kontoor’s standards. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews and evaluates our strategies, programs, policies and practices relating to environmental, social and governance issues and impacts to support the sustainable and responsible growth of our business. Kontoor believes that in order to grow as a Company, it has a responsibility to help improve the well-being of its communities. Kontoor articulates its commitments to corporate sustainability and responsibility in its Code of Conduct which can be found on our website at www.kontoorbrands.com. 
The Company issued its 2020 Sustainability Report, our second annual sustainability report, in December 2021, which is our first report prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI") and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") standards. Our sustainability strategy is built on innovation, design and sustainable performance, underscoring our commitment to inspire people to live with passion and confidence. We believe that sustainability translates to the dynamic process of continual improvement for people, for our product and for the planet. The report outlines key elements of Kontoor’s sustainability strategy such as embedding circularity into our products, seeking to reduce waste during manufacturing and launching initiatives that can increase traceability in our products from origin to finished goods. The report also reviews progress in advancing several important initiatives. These include the expansion of our Indigood® program in March 2021, which will help us reach our goal of saving 10 billion liters of water by 2025, and the advancement of industry partnerships.
