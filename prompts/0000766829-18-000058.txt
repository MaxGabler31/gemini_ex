General Development of Business
SJW Corp. was incorporated in California on February 8, 1985. On November 15, 2016, SJW Corp. changed its state of incorporation from the state of California to the state of Delaware and changed its name to SJW Group. SJW Group is a holding company with three subsidiaries:

• | San Jose Water Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Group, with its headquarters located at 110 West Taylor Street in San Jose, California 95110, was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1866. As part of a reorganization on February 8, 1985, San Jose Water Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp. and subsequently SJW Group on November 15, 2016. San Jose Water Company is a public utility in the business of providing water service to approximately 230,000 connections that serve a population of approximately one million people in an area comprising approximately 139 square miles in the metropolitan San Jose, California area. 


• | SJWTX, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Group, was incorporated in the State of Texas in 2005. SJWTX, Inc. is doing business as Canyon Lake Water Service Company (“CLWSC”). CLWSC is a public utility in the business of providing water service to approximately 14,000 connections that serve approximately 42,000 people. CLWSC’s service area comprises more than 244 square miles in western Comal County and southern Blanco County in the growing region between San Antonio and Austin, Texas. SJWTX, Inc. has a 25% interest in Acequia Water Supply Corporation (“Acequia”). The water supply corporation has been determined to be a variable interest entity within the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, “Consolidation” with SJWTX, Inc. as the primary beneficiary. As a result, Acequia has been consolidated with SJWTX, Inc. 


• | SJW Land Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Group, was incorporated in 1985. SJW Land Company owns undeveloped land and operates commercial buildings in Tennessee. SJW Land also has a 70% limited partnership interest in 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P. The partnership owned a commercial building in California which was sold by the partnership on April 6, 2017. See Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of the sales transaction. 

Texas Water Alliance Limited (“TWA”), was previously a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Group undertaking activities necessary to develop a water supply project in Texas. On February 22, 2016, SJW Group entered into an agreement with the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority (“GBRA”), pursuant to which SJW Group agreed to sell all of its equity interests in TWA for $31.0 million in cash (the “TWA Agreement”). The transaction closed with GBRA on November 16, 2017. See Note 13 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of the sales transaction.
Together, San Jose Water Company, CLWSC and TWA, up to the date of sale, are referred to as “Water Utility Services.”
SJW Land Company and its consolidated variable interest entity, 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P., which operates commercial building rentals, are collectively referred to as “Real Estate Services.”

Regulation and Rates
San Jose Water Company’s rates, service and other matters affecting its business are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”).
Generally, there are three types of rate adjustments that affect San Jose Water Company’s revenue collection: general rate adjustments, cost of capital adjustments, and offset rate adjustments. General rate adjustments are authorized in general rate case decisions, which usually authorize an initial rate adjustment followed by two annual escalation adjustments. General rate applications are normally filed and processed during the last year covered by the most recent general rate case as required by the CPUC in order to avoid any gaps in regulatory decisions on general rate adjustments.
Cost of capital adjustments are rate adjustments resulting from the CPUC’s usual tri-annual establishment of a reasonable rate of return for San Jose Water Company’s capital investments.
The purpose of an offset rate adjustment is to compensate utilities for changes in specific pre-authorized offsettable capital investments or expenses, primarily for purchased water, groundwater extraction, purchased power and pensions. Pursuant to Section 792.5 of the California Public Utilities Code, a balancing account must be maintained for each expense item for which such revenue offsets have been authorized. Memorandum accounts track revenue impacts due to catastrophic events, certain unforeseen water quality expenses related to new federal and state water quality standards, energy efficiency, water conservation, water tariffs and other approved activities or as directed by the CPUC such as the memorandum account for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the “Tax Act”). The purpose of a balancing and memorandum account is to track the under-collection or over-collection associated with such expense changes.
On February 25, 2016, the CPUC passed Resolution W-5074 which affirmed San Jose Water Company’s Water Shortage Contingency Plan in Schedule 14.1 with water allocations and drought surcharges. Schedule 14.1 is the tariff that includes the drought allocations and drought surcharges in effect for residential customers and for dedicated landscape services. San Jose Water Company originally implemented Schedule 14.1 in June 2015 in response to the Governor’s Executive Order B-29-15, and orders by the State Water Board and the CPUC. San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letters 491 and 493 on June 24, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, with the CPUC to revise the Tariff Rule 14.1. The applicable tariffs were revised to reflect Santa Clara Valley Water District (“SCVWD”) conservation standard of a 20% reduction from 2013 usage levels. With these advice letters, San Jose Water Company proposed to ease the existing drought allocations and existing drought rules. San Jose Water Company’s requested changes were approved by the CPUC with an effective date of July 1, 2016. Subsequently, with the improved water supply outlook, the allocation and drought surcharge program was suspended effective February 1, 2017.
On November 15, 2016, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 498 with the CPUC requesting a revenue increase of $13.2 million, or 3.8%, for the 2017 escalation year included in the 2015 General Rate Case.  This request was approved and the new rates became effective on January 1, 2017. 
On January 6, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 501 with the CPUC requesting authorization to implement a sales reconciliation mechanism to better conform to water forecasts authorized in the last general rate case to recorded consumption for the period of October 2015 through September 2016. The CPUC has ordered all Class A and B water utilities that have a five percent or greater divergence between authorized and actual sales during declared drought years to consider requesting a sales reconciliation mechanism to better conform to sale forecasts authorized in the last general rate case to recorded consumption. On May 3, 2017, the CPUC rejected the filing citing the end of the drought and the improved California water supply conditions. On May 10, 2017, San Jose Water Company formally requested the CPUC’s review of the rejection. The request was rejected by the CPUC on January 11, 2018, due to the improved water supply conditions.
San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 505 on January 27, 2017 with the CPUC to suspend its allocation program and all drought surcharges in Schedule 14.1, Water Shortage Contingency Plan with Staged Mandatory Reductions and Drought Surcharges.  However, Schedule 14.1, and all of the water use restrictions defined therein, remain in effect in light of the call for continued conservation by the SCVWD and the State Water Resources Control Board.  The allocations and drought surcharges were suspended effective February 1, 2017. 
On February 17, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 506 with the CPUC requesting authorization to increase its revenue requirement by $5.3 million via a rate base offset for calendar year 2016 plant additions related to the Montevina Water Treatment Plant upgrade project. The bill for a residential customer using 15 CCF per month will increase by $1.52, or 1.5% per month. The advice letter was approved and new rates became effective March 20, 2017.
As required by the CPUC, on April 3, 2017 San Jose Water Company filed an application requesting authority to increase its authorized Cost of Capital for the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. The cost of capital determination is a triannual regulatory process in which the CPUC determines a regulated water utility's cost of long-term debt and common stock and the components of its authorized capital structure. If approved by the CPUC as originally filed, San Jose Water Company’s annual revenues would have increased by approximately $7.6 million or about 2.1% in 2018. On February 6, 2018, the CPUC issued a proposed decision in the proceeding. The proposed decision provides for a reduction to San Jose Water Company’s authorized return on equity from 9.43% to 8.30% and its overall return on rate base from 8.09% to 
 4

7.19%. The proposal is subject to change until a final CPUC decision is determined at the full CPUC meeting currently scheduled for March 22, 2018. If the proposal is approved without change, the reduction in authorized revenue requirement would be approximately $10 million for 2018 which could have a material adverse impact on SJW Group’s net income.
On May 2, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 508 with the CPUC to reinstate surcharges to recover the remaining $1.0 million balance from the 2014 Mandatory Conservation Revenue Adjustment Memorandum Account (“MCRAMA”) and to recover the remaining $2.2 million balance from the 2015 WCMA. The under-collections will be recovered via surcharges of $0.08 per CCF and $0.1441 per CCF on the existing quantity rate for the 2014 MCRAMA and the 2015 WCMA, respectively. This request was approved on June 1, 2017. San Jose Water Company anticipates collection of the remaining amounts in less than 12 months.
On May 26, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 509 with the CPUC requesting authorization to increase revenues by $12.4 million, or approximately 3.46%. The increase is intended to offset the increases to purchased potable water, purchased ground water, and purchased recycled water charges implemented by San Jose Water Company’s water wholesaler effective July 1, 2017. This request was approved on June 26, 2017.
On June 6, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 510 with the CPUC requesting authorization to issue a surcredit totaling $1.8 million to refund service charge rate changes as a result of a change in billing practice effective January 1, 2017.  The refund period covers prorated service charge rate changes that occurred from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2016. On August 11, 2017, the CPUC rejected Advice Letter No. 510 citing the formal complaint filed by some customers and served to San Jose Water Company by the CPUC over the same issue. A pre-hearing conference was held on the formal complaint on September 12, 2017, where the parties agreed to suspend the proceeding.
On September 29, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 512 with the CPUC requesting authorization to re-implement a surcharge to recover the under-collected balance of $11.5 million remaining from the 2012 General Rate Case true-up due to the delayed 2012 General Rate Case Application decision. Actual sales were substantially lower than the CPUC authorized sales estimate used to calculate the surcharge amount over the three-year recovery period. San Jose Water Company is seeking to recover the remaining under-collected balance. This request was withdrawn on January 5, 2018, and the recovery of the remaining under-collected balance was requested as part of our 2018 General Rate Case Application.
On November 15, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 513/513A with the CPUC requesting a revenue increase of $15.7 million, or 4.22%, for the 2018 escalation year included in the 2015 General Rate Case. This request was approved and the new rates became effective on January 1, 2018.
On November 29, 2017, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 514 with the CPUC requesting to adjust the Utilities Reimbursement Account User Fees as directed by CPUC Resolution M-4832. The reimbursement fee was reduced from 1.44% to 1.40%. This request was approved and the new fee became effective on January 1, 2018.
San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 515 on December 28, 2017 with the CPUC requesting authorization to establish the 2018 Tax Accounting Memorandum Account. This memorandum account will capture any changes to revenue requirement resulting from the impact of the Tax Act bill signed into law December 22, 2017. This request became effective on January 1, 2018.
On January 4, 2018, San Jose Water Company filed General Rate Case Application No. 18-01-004 requesting authority for an increase of revenue of $34.3 million, or 9.76%, in 2019, $14.2 million, or 3.70%, in 2020 and $20.6 million, or 5.17%, in 2021. The application also includes requests to recover $20.7 million from balancing and memorandum accounts, the establishment of a Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism and Sales Reconciliation Mechanism, and a shift to greater revenue collection in the service charge. The application is a year-long review process and the new rates, if approved, are expected to be effective January 1, 2019.
CLWSC is subject to the economic regulation of the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (“PUCT”). The PUCT authorize rate increases after the filing of an Application for a Rate/Tariff Change. Rate cases may be filed as they become necessary, provided there is no current rate case outstanding. Further, rate cases may not be filed more frequently than once every 12 months.

See Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for information regarding SJW Group’s business segments.
Description of Business
General
The principal business of Water Utility Services consists of the production, purchase, storage, purification, distribution, wholesale, and retail sale of water. San Jose Water Company provides water services to approximately 230,000 connections 
 5

that serve approximately one million people residing in portions of the cities of San Jose and Cupertino and in the cities of Campbell, Monte Sereno, Saratoga and the Town of Los Gatos, and adjacent unincorporated territories, all in the County of Santa Clara in the State of California. San Jose Water Company distributes water to customers in accordance with accepted water utility methods. CLWSC provides water service to approximately 14,000 connections that serve approximately 42,000 people in a service area comprising more than 244 square miles in the growing region between San Antonio and Austin, Texas. TWA had water lease arrangements with certain landowners in Gonzales County, Texas. TWA’s groundwater production and transportation permits were approved by the groundwater district in Gonzales County in January of 2013. On February 22, 2016, SJW Group entered into an agreement with GBRA, pursuant to which SJW Group agreed to sell all of its equity interests in TWA to GBRA. On November 16, 2017, the transaction closed and TWA is no longer part of the Water Utility Services following the closing. SJW Land Company owns an undeveloped real estate property, commercial and warehouse properties in Tennessee and holds a 70% limited partnership interest in 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P. 
San Jose Water Company also provides non-tariffed services under agreements with municipalities and other utilities. These non-tariffed services include water system operations, maintenance agreements and antenna site leases.
In October 1997, San Jose Water Company commenced operation of the City of Cupertino municipal water system under the terms of a 25-year lease. The system is adjacent to the San Jose Water Company service area and has approximately 4,600 service connections. Under the terms of the lease, San Jose Water Company paid an upfront $6.8 million concession fee to the City of Cupertino that is being amortized over the contract term. San Jose Water Company assumed responsibility for all maintenance and operating costs of the system, while receiving all payments for water service.
Among other things, operating results from the water business fluctuate according to the demand for water, which is often influenced by seasonal conditions, such as impact of drought, summer temperatures or the amount and timing of precipitation in Water Utility Services’ service areas. Revenue, production expenses and income are affected by changes in water sales and the availability of surface water supply. Overhead costs, such as payroll and benefits, depreciation, interest on long-term debt, and property taxes, remain fairly constant despite variations in the amount of water sold. As a result, earnings are highest in the higher demand, warm summer months and lowest in the lower demand, cool winter months.
Water Supply
San Jose Water Company’s water supply consists of groundwater from wells, surface water from watershed run-off and diversion, reclaimed water, and imported water purchased from the SCVWD under the terms of a master contract with SCVWD expiring in 2051. Purchased water provides approximately 40% to 50% of San Jose Water Company’s annual production. San Jose Water Company pumps approximately 40% to 50% of its water supply from the underground basin and pays a groundwater extraction charge to SCVWD. Surface supply, which during a normal rainfall year satisfies about 6% to 8% of San Jose Water Company’s annual water supply needs, provides approximately 1% of its water supply in a dry year and approximately 14% in a wet year. In dry years, the decrease in water from surface run-off and diversion and the corresponding increase in purchased and pumped water, increases production expenses substantially.
The pumps and motors at San Jose Water Company’s groundwater production facilities are propelled by electric power. San Jose Water Company has installed standby power generators at 33 of its strategic water production sites and manages a fleet of 21 portable generators deployed throughout the distribution system for power outages at remaining pumping facilities. In addition, the commercial office and operations control centers are outfitted with standby power equipment that allow critical distribution and customer service operations to continue during a power outage. SCVWD has informed San Jose Water Company that its filter plants, which deliver purchased water to San Jose Water Company, are also equipped with standby generators. In the event of a power outage, San Jose Water Company believes it will be able to prevent an interruption of service to customers for a limited period by pumping water using generator power and by using purchased water from SCVWD.
In 2017, the level of water in the Santa Clara Valley groundwater basin, which is managed by the SCVWD, experienced an increase due to: (1) a reduction in groundwater pumping by various water retailers in the region, and (2) a substantial increase in groundwater recharge efforts on the part of the SCVWD. As reported by the SCVWD at the end of 2017, the groundwater level in the Santa Clara Plain was 7 feet higher compared to the same time in 2016, and 27 feet higher than the five-year average. The total groundwater storage at the end of 2017 was within the lower range of Stage 1 (Normal) of the SCVWD’s Water Shortage Contingency Plan. On January 1, 2018, SCVWD’s 10 reservoirs were 27% full with 45,478 acre-feet of water in storage. As of December 31, 2017, San Jose Water Company’s Lake Elsman were 89.9% full with 5,533 acre-feet of water, approximately 227.8% of the five-year seasonal average. In addition, the rainfall at San Jose Water Company’s Lake Elsman was measured at 8.64 inches for the period from July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, which is 49.5% of the five-year average. Local surface water is a less costly source of water than groundwater or purchased water and its availability significantly impacts San Jose Water Company’s results of operations. A retrofit project at San Jose Water Company’s Montevina Water Treatment Plant is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2018 and will begin full operations of treating local surface water. San Jose Water Company believes that its various sources of water supply will be sufficient to meet customer demand in 2018.

In response to the severe drought in California in 2015 and 2016, SCVWD announced a call for 30% conservation and restrictions on outdoor watering of ornamental landscapes two days a week through June 30, 2016. While the drought condition improved in late 2016 and 2017, the SCVWD reduced its conservation target from 30% to 20% and also increased the number of outdoor watering days from two to three effective July 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017. On January 24, 2017, the SCVWD announced that they were maintaining their call for 20% conservation and restrictions on outdoor watering for ornamental landscapes to no more than three days a week effective February 1, 2017.
In 2015, San Jose Water Company was authorized by the CPUC to activate Stage 3 of Tariff Rule 14.1 which is a water shortage contingency plan with mandatory water usage reductions and drought surcharges resulting from usage above customer allocations. Tariff Rule 14.1 focuses primarily on restrictions of outdoor watering which accounts for 50% of a typical customer’s water usage. Effective July 1, 2016, San Jose Water Company implemented its CPUC approved water shortage contingency plan with mandatory water usage reductions and drought surcharges to reflect the SCVWD’s call for 20% conservation. The drought surcharges were not recorded as revenue. Rather, they were recorded in a regulatory liability account authorized by the CPUC to track lost revenues resulting from conservation. The amount recorded in the surcharge account was being used to offset future rate increases that would otherwise be necessary to recover lost revenue due to drought conservation efforts. San Jose Water Company suspended its allocation and drought surcharge program provided for in Schedule 14.1, Water Shortage Contingency Plan with Staged Mandatory Reductions and Drought Surcharges on February 1, 2017. On June 13, 2017, the SCVWD adopted Resolution 17-43 to encourage making water conservation a way of life in California through recommendations on watering schedules and a call for customers to achieve a 20% reduction in water use as compared to 2013. In addition to the SCVWD’s resolution, the mandatory water use restrictions set forth by the State Water Resources Control Board’s Emergency Regulations remain in effect. San Jose Water Company is continually working to maintain compliance with the various drought rules and regulations and is also working with local governments as well as the SCVWD to communicate consistent messages to the public about use restrictions and related matters associated with the recent drought. 
California also faces long-term water supply challenges. San Jose Water Company actively works with SCVWD to meet the challenges by continuing to educate customers on responsible water use practices and conducting long-range water supply planning.
SJW Group and San Jose Water Company provide additional information on their websites relating to customer water usage. The websites are accessible at www.sjwater.com and www.sjwgroup.com. SJW Group intends to update the websites as appropriate during the period in which the water shortage contingency plan of SCVWD remains in effect. The information on our websites is not incorporated by reference to or part of this report.
CLWSC’s water supply consists of groundwater from wells and purchased treated and raw water from the GBRA. CLWSC has long-term agreements with the GBRA, which expire in 2037, 2040, 2044 and 2050. The agreements, which are take-or-pay contracts, provide CLWSC with an aggregate of 6,900 acre-feet of water per year from Canyon Lake at prices that may be adjusted periodically by GBRA.
Please also see further discussion under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Franchises
Franchises granted by local jurisdictions permit Water Utility Services to construct, maintain, and operate water distribution systems within the streets and other public properties of a given jurisdiction. San Jose Water Company holds the necessary franchises to provide water in portions of the cities of San Jose and Cupertino and in the cities of Campbell, Monte Sereno and Saratoga, the Town of Los Gatos and the unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County. None of the franchises have a termination date, other than the franchise for the unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County, which terminates in 2020.
CLWSC holds the franchises for water and wastewater services to the City of Bulverde and the City of Spring Branch, which terminates in 2029 and 2036, respectively. The unincorporated areas that CLWSC serves in Comal and Blanco Counties do not require water service providers to obtain franchises.
Seasonal Factors
Water sales are seasonal in nature and influenced by weather conditions. The timing of precipitation and climatic conditions can cause seasonal water consumption by customers to vary significantly. Demand for water is generally lower during the cooler and rainy winter months. Demand increases in the spring when the temperature rises and rain diminishes.
Competition
San Jose Water Company and CLWSC are public utilities regulated by the CPUC and PUCT, respectively, and operate within a service area approved by the regulators. The statutory laws provide that no other investor-owned public utility may operate in the public utilities’ service areas without first obtaining from the regulator a certificate of public convenience and 
 7

necessity. Past experience shows such a certificate will be issued only after demonstrating that service in such area is inadequate.
California law also provides that whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend utility service to the service area of a privately-owned public utility, like San Jose Water Company, such an act constitutes the taking of property and is conditioned upon payment of just compensation to the private utility.
Under the California law, municipalities, water districts and other public agencies have been authorized to engage in the ownership and operation of water systems. Such agencies are empowered to condemn properties operated by privately-owned public utilities upon payment of just compensation and are further authorized to issue bonds (including revenue bonds) for the purpose of acquiring or constructing water systems. To the company’s knowledge, no municipality, water district or other public agency has pending any proceeding to condemn any part of its water systems.
Environmental Matters
Water Utility Services’ produces potable water in accordance with all applicable county, state and federal environmental rules and regulations. Additionally, public utilities are subject to environmental regulation by various other state and local governmental authorities.
Water Utility Services is currently in compliance with all of the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (the “EPA”) surface water treatment performance standards, drinking water standards for disinfection by-products and primary maximum contaminant levels. These standards have been adopted and are enforced by the California State Water Board, Division of Drinking Water and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for San Jose Water Company and CLWSC, respectively.
Other state and local environmental regulations apply to our Water Utility Services’ operations and facilities. These regulations relate primarily to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and discharges to the environment. In 2008, as part of routine replacement of infrastructure, San Jose Water Company identified legacy equipment containing elemental mercury which was released into the surrounding soil. San Jose Water Company has determined the release posed no risk of contamination to the water supply, notified the appropriate authorities and remediated the affected area. San Jose Water Company also identified 10 other potentially affected sites. Eight of these sites have been remediated and San Jose Water Company is continuing its assessment of the remaining sites in conjunction with its infrastructure replacement program. SJW Group believes there will be no material financial impact related to this matter. In 2016, San Jose Water Company began performing hazardous materials site assessments and remediation prior to the construction phase of capital projects. The site assessments are performed to remove any legacy materials and to obtain site closures from the Santa Clara County Department of Environmental Health under its Voluntary Cleanup Program.
San Jose Water Company is a permittee under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit (“NPDES”) for drinking water system discharges to Waters of the United States (“WOTUS”). An unplanned non-compliant discharge under the NPDES permit took place on September 10, 2017. The event has been reported to the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Control Board and San Jose Water Company has been notified that enforcement action has been pursued by the agency. Although this matter has not been resolved, San Jose Water Company believes that that there will be no material financial impact related to this matter.
San Jose Water Company is currently in compliance with all state and local regulations governing hazardous materials, point and non-point source discharges and the warning provisions of the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986. Please also see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, SJW Group had 411 full-time employees, of whom 368 were San Jose Water Company employees and 43 were CLWSC employees. At San Jose Water Company, 134 were executive, administrative or supervisory personnel, and 234 were members of unions. On December 1, 2016 and November 8, 2016, San Jose Water Company reached three-year collective bargaining agreements with the Utility Workers of America, representing the majority of all employees, and the International Union of Operating Engineers, representing certain employees in the engineering department, respectively, covering the period from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019. The agreements include a 3.5% wage increase in 2017, 3% in 2018 and 4% in 2019 for union workers. As of December 31, 2017, CLWSC had 43 employees, of whom 9 were exempt and 34 were non-exempt employees. Non-exempt employees are subject to overtime but are not represented by a union.
