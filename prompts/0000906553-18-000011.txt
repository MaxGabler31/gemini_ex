ITEM 1.    Business
Overview 
Boyd Gaming Corporation (the "Company," the "Registrant," "Boyd Gaming," "we" or "us") is a multi-jurisdictional gaming company that has been in operation since 1975. Headquartered in Las Vegas, we have 24 wholly owned gaming entertainment properties in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana and Mississippi.
Our primary areas of focus are: (i) ensuring our existing operations are managed as efficiently as possible and remain positioned for growth, including our strategic investing in non-gaming amenities; (ii) improving our capital structure and strengthening our balance sheet, including paying down debt, improving operations and diversifying our asset base; and (iii) successfully implementing our growth strategy, which is built on identifying development opportunities and acquiring assets that are a good strategic fit and provide an appropriate return to our shareholders. 
Over the past several years, we have undertaken several programs aimed at reducing our cost structure in an effort to manage our properties' operations under tightened revenue trends. We have established a more efficient business model that we believe is helping us realize improved results, and we believe we have an opportunity to realize additional cost savings by leveraging our size and scale. We have strategically reinvested in our non-gaming amenities, including hotel rooms and restaurants, via a multi-year program that has now been completed to better capitalize on customers' evolving spending behaviors. We continue to manage our cost and expense structure to adjust to current business volumes and to generate strong and stable cash flows.
During 2017, we completed several transactions that improved our long-term financial position and strengthened our balance sheet. During first quarter 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 2 and Refinancing Amendment to our credit agreement which combined the Term B-1 Loan and Term B-2 Loan into the Refinancing Term B Loans. Since first quarter 2017, we have paid $85.0 million in prepayments on our Refinancing Term B Loans. On May 2, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had reaffirmed the Company's existing share repurchase program and authorized the reinstatement of the Company’s cash dividend program. Starting in second quarter 2017, the Company repurchased 1.2 million shares. The Company declared quarterly dividends of $0.05 per share on May 2, 2017, September 6, 2017 and December 7, 2017.
We continually work to position our Company for greater success by strengthening our existing operations and growing through capital investment and other strategic initiatives. An example is our recent strategic initiative to enhance our non-gaming amenities at properties across the country that is designed to ensure our properties remain competitive and compelling to customers across generations. This initiative began in 2014 and continued into 2017, a period during which we invested over $100 million in these amenities. We have redesigned and enhanced approximately 3,100 hotel rooms at our properties across the country. We also introduced new food and beverage concepts across the Company, including Alder & Birch, Copper Whisk, Ondori, Bailiwick and the French Market Buffet at The Orleans, California Noodle House at the California, the Filament Bar at Fremont and the Filament Meetery & Eatery at Diamond Jo Dubuque, the Spotted Horse and Fast & Lucy’s Pub at Evangeline Downs, Angry Butcher and Big Mess BBQ at Sam's Town Las Vegas and Brigg’s Oyster Company at Suncoast. 
On December 18, 2017, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with Penn National Gaming, Inc. (the "Penn National Purchase Agreement"), to acquire the operations of four properties, which include Ameristar St. Charles and Ameristar Kansas City, both in Missouri, Belterra Casino Resort in Florence, Indiana, and Belterra Park in Cincinnati, Ohio, for total cash consideration of $575.0 million (the "Penn National Purchase"). As part of the transaction, we will enter into a master lease agreement with Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. ("GLPI"), which owns the real estate of Ameristar St. Charles, Ameristar Kansas City and Belterra Casino Resort. GLPI has entered into an agreement to purchase the real estate of Belterra Park from Penn National, and Belterra Park’s real estate will be leased to us as part of our master lease agreement with GLPI. The terms of our lease agreement will be substantially similar to Pinnacle’s current master lease with GLPI.
On December 20, 2017, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with Valley Forge Convention Center Partners, L.P. (the "Valley Forge Merger Agreement"), to acquire Valley Forge Casino Resort in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, for total cash consideration of $280.5 million (the "Valley Forge Merger").
The purchase price in each acquisition is subject to adjustment based on cash, working capital and indebtedness at closing. The completion of each acquisition is subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. In addition, the Penn National Purchase is also contingent upon the successful completion of Penn National’s proposed acquisition of Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. Both acquisitions are currently expected to close in the second half of 2018.
We believe that the following factors have contributed to our success in the past and are central to our success in the future:
1


• | nine of our Las Vegas properties are well-positioned to capitalize on the attractive Las Vegas locals market;


• | our three downtown Las Vegas properties focus a majority of their marketing programs on, and derive a majority of their revenues from, a unique niche - Hawaiian customers;


• | our operations are geographically diversified within the United States;


• | we have strengthened our balance sheet and have increasing free cash flow;


• | we have the ability to expand certain existing properties and make opportunistic and strategic acquisitions; and


• | we have an experienced management team.

Properties 
As of December 31, 2017, we own and operate 24 properties offering a total of 1,358,856 square feet of casino space, 30,267 slot machines, 632 table games and 9,372 hotel rooms. We derive the majority of our gross revenues from our gaming operations, which generated approximately 75% of gross revenues for both 2017 and 2016 and 76% of gross revenues in 2015. Food and beverage gross revenues represent our next most significant revenue source, generating approximately 13% of gross revenues for 2017, 2016, and 2015. Room revenues and other revenues each contributed less than 10% of gross revenues during each year.
We view each operating property as an operating segment. For financial reporting purposes, we aggregate our properties into three reportable business segments: (i) Las Vegas Locals; (ii) Downtown Las Vegas; and (iii) Midwest and South. 
As a result of the sale of our equity interest in Borgata (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures), we report our interest in Borgata as discontinued operations. As of September 27, 2016, our Las Vegas Locals segment includes our wholly owned subsidiary Aliante, and as of December 20, 2016, our Las Vegas Locals segment includes our wholly owned subsidiaries Cannery and Eastside Cannery. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to our consolidated financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of these activities.
For financial information related to our segments as of and for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, see Note 13, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8.

In addition to these properties, we own and operate a travel agency and a captive insurance company that underwrites travel-related insurance, each located in Hawaii.

Downtown Las Vegas Properties 
Our three Downtown Las Vegas properties directly compete with eight other casinos that operate in downtown Las Vegas.

We also have strong, informal relationships with other Hawaiian travel agencies and offer affordable all-inclusive packages. These relationships, combined with our Hawaiian promotions, have allowed the Cal, Fremont Hotel and Casino ("Fremont") and Main Street Station Casino, Brewery and Hotel ("Main Street Station") to capture a significant share of the Hawaiian tourist trade in Las Vegas.

Competition
Our properties generally operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against other gaming companies as well as other hospitality, entertainment and leisure companies. We face significant competition in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such competition may intensify in some of these jurisdictions if new gaming operations open in these markets or existing competitors expand their operations. Our properties compete directly with other gaming properties in each state in which we operate, as well as in adjacent states. We also compete for customers with other casino operators in other markets, including casinos located on Native American reservations, and other forms of gaming, such as lotteries and internet gaming. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater name recognition and marketing and financial resources. In some instances, particularly with Native American casinos, our competitors pay substantially lower taxes or no taxes at all. We believe that increased legalized gaming in other states, particularly in areas close to our existing gaming properties and the development or expansion of Native American gaming in or near the states in which we operate, could create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our operations or future development projects. 
Future Development Opportunities
Development agreement with Wilton Rancheria
We have a development agreement and a management agreement with Wilton Rancheria, a federally-recognized Native American tribe located southeast of Sacramento, California, to develop and manage a gaming entertainment complex, subject to approval by the National Indian Gaming Commission. In January 2017, the tribe received a favorable Record of Decision from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and in February 2017, the land was taken into trust on behalf of the tribe. In September 2017, the California State Legislature unanimously approved, and the Governor of California executed, a tribal-state gaming compact with the tribe allowing the development of the casino. With the compact now in place, we are in the process of finalizing project design and construction planning. Once commenced, the construction timeline is expected to span 18 to 24 months. The land parcel taken into trust is located next to a mall being developed by the Howard Hughes Corporation, approximately 15 miles southeast of Sacramento. The project is located on Highway 99, one of the two major north-south freeways in the Sacramento area. 
Frequent Player Loyalty Programs
B Connected
We have established a nationwide branding initiative and loyalty program. Our players use their "B Connected" cards to earn and redeem points at nearly all of our properties. The "B Connected" club, among other benefits, rewards players for their loyalty as well as entitles them to qualify for promotions and earn rewards toward slot, video poker, or table games play.
In addition to the "B Connected" player loyalty program, we operate the "B Connected Mobile" program, the first multi-property, loyalty program-based iPhone and Android applications of its kind in the gaming industry. B Connected Mobile is a personalized mobile application that delivers customized offers and information directly to a customer’s iPhone, iPad or Android device, making "B Connected Mobile" the first application of its kind available on multiple platforms. The application further expands the benefits of the "B Connected" program by providing real-time personalized information on hotel, dining and gaming offers when a customer visits a Boyd property, instant access to event information, schedules and special offers, a search engine that allows customers to find Boyd Gaming casinos that have their favorite machines and displays the games’ locations on a casino floor map, the ability to track "B Connected" point balances in real time, and the ability to make immediate hotel or restaurant reservations. These tools allow our customers to receive the greatest value from their "B Connected" membership, and ensure that our marketing is as effective as possible.
We further improved our "B Connected" loyalty program with the introduction of "B Connected Social" in 2012, which rewards users for using "B Connected Online", "B Connected Mobile", or sharing offers and events on social networks. "B Connected Social" is a dynamic network loyalty program that allows "B Connected" members to share offers with friends, connect to their favorite social networks, check in online via certain social networks, as well as participate in a variety of online activities including

Kansas Star, Diamond Jo Dubuque, Aliante, Cannery, and Eastside Cannery continue to sponsor their own player loyalty programs to build brand awareness and leverage loyalty through marketing and promotional programs to retain existing customers, maintain trip frequency, acquire new customers, and recover lapsed customers. These properties offer their guests comprehensive, competitive and targeted marketing and promotion programs. Each program offers players a hassle-free way of earning points redeemable at each respective property for slot and table games play, food, beverage and retail items as well as complementaries and other rewards and benefits based on play. In addition, each property strives to differentiate its casino with high-quality guest services to further enhance overall brand and customer experience.
In the future we plan to extend the B Connected program to these properties, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals. The implementation of "B Connected" will replace the individual property programs described above and provide our customers at these properties even more value for their rewards with a multi-property player loyalty program.
Other Promotional Activities
We provide other promotional offers and discounts targeted towards new customers, frequent customers, inactive customers, customers of various levels of play, and prospective customers who have not yet visited our properties, and mid-week and other promotional activities that seek to generate visits to our properties during slower periods. Complementaries are usually in the form of monetary discounts, and other rewards generally can only be redeemed at our restaurants, retail and spa facilities.
Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures primarily in the jurisdictions where our facilities are located or docked. Some jurisdictions, including Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and may require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A detailed description of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and is herein incorporated by reference.
If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or not such legislation will be enacted. The federal government has also previously considered a federal tax on casino revenues and the elimination of betting on NCAA events and may consider such a tax or eliminations on betting in the future. In addition, gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us. 
Employees and Labor Relations 
At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 19,707 persons, and had collective bargaining agreements with two unions covering 1,811 employees. Negotiations for a first contract with an organized bargaining unit are in progress at several of our Las Vegas properties. Negotiations for contract renewal are also in progress at two of our Midwest and South properties.
