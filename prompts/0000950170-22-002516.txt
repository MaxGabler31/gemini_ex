Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pursuing a targeted approach to neuroscience that combines a deep understanding of disease-related biology and neurocircuitry of the brain with advanced chemistry and central nervous system, or CNS, target receptor selective pharmacology to discover and design new therapies. We seek to transform the lives of patients through the development of new therapies for neuroscience diseases, including schizophrenia, epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. We are advancing our extensive and diverse pipeline with numerous clinical trials underway or planned, including three ongoing Phase 3 trials and an open-label extension trial for tavapadon in Parkinson's, two planned Phase 2 trials and a planned open-label extension trial for emraclidine (formerly known as CVL-231) in schizophrenia and an ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial with an open-label extension trial for darigabat (formerly known as CVL-865) in focal epilepsy. See “—Our Pipeline” below. We have built a highly experienced team of senior leaders and neuroscience drug developers who combine a nimble, results-driven biotech mindset with the proven expertise of large pharmaceutical company experience and capabilities in drug discovery and development.
 Our portfolio of product candidates is based on a differentiated approach to addressing neuroscience diseases, which incorporates three key pillars: (1) targeted neurocircuitry, where we seek to unlock new treatment opportunities by precisely identifying and targeting the neurocircuit that underlies a given neuroscience disease, (2) receptor subtype selectivity, where we selectively target the receptor subtype(s) related to the disease physiology to minimize undesirable off-target effects while maximizing activity and (3) differentiated pharmacology, where we design full and partial agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators to precisely fine-tune the receptor pharmacology and neurocircuit activity to avoid over-activation or over-suppression of the endogenous physiologic range. In addition, our portfolio is supported by robust data packages and rigorous clinical trial execution designed to elucidate the key points of differentiation for our compounds. We believe that this science-driven approach is critical to achieving optimal therapeutic activity while minimizing unintended side effects of currently available therapies.
Behind our portfolio stands a team with a multi-decade track record of drug approvals and commercial success. This track record has been driven by their extensive experience with empirically-driven clinical trial design and implementation, a history of successful interactions with regulatory agencies and relationships with global key opinion leaders. We believe that the distinctive combination of our management team and our existing pipeline has the potential to bring to patients the next generation of transformative neuroscience therapies.
Our Lead Programs
 1.Emraclidine is a positive allosteric modulator, or PAM, that selectively targets the muscarinic acetylcholine 4 receptor subtype, or M4. In June 2021, we announced positive topline results for a Phase 1b trial of emraclidine in schizophrenia, consisting of Part A, a multiple ascending dose, or MAD, study and Part B, a pharmacodynamic, or PD, assessment. Emraclidine demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or PANSS, total score at six weeks and was generally well-tolerated compared with placebo at the two dose levels evaluated in Part B. We plan to initiate two Phase 2 clinical trials in schizophrenia and a 52-week open-label extension trial to begin development of the required safety database by the middle of 2022. Data are expected from the Phase 2 trials in the first half of 2024. In addition, we plan to evaluate the potential of this mechanism in other populations, including dementia-related psychosis.
 2.Darigabat is a PAM that selectively targets the alpha-2/3/5 subunits of the GABAA receptor. In the second half of 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, known as REALIZE, in patients with drug-resistant focal onset seizures, or focal epilepsy. Data are expected in the second half of 2022 for the Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in focal epilepsy. In February 2022, we announced positive topline results for a Phase 1 trial of darigabat in acute anxiety in healthy volunteers. Both doses of darigabat demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant anxiolytic activity compared with placebo in this proof-of-principle trial. Darigabat was generally well-tolerated in this trial, with no serious adverse events and no discontinuations in the darigabat cohorts. We intend to pursue development of darigabat in anxiety-related disorders. 


3.Tavapadon is a selective dopamine D1/D5 receptor partial agonist that we are developing for the treatment of early- and late-stage Parkinson’s disease. We initiated a registration-directed Phase 3 program for tavapadon beginning in January 2020, which includes two trials in early-stage Parkinson’s, known as TEMPO-1 and TEMPO-2, one trial in late-stage Parkinson’s, known as TEMPO-3, and an open-label extension trial, known as TEMPO-4. We expect initial data from our Phase 3 program to be available beginning in the first half of 2023.
 4.CVL-871 is a selective dopamine D1/D5 receptor partial agonist specifically designed to achieve a modest level of partial agonism, which we believe may be useful in modulating the complex neural networks that govern cognition, motivation and apathy behaviors in neurodegenerative diseases. In the second quarter of 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for CVL-871 for the treatment of dementia-related apathy. We are conducting a Phase 2a exploratory trial in dementia-related apathy, with data expected in the first half of 2023. 
 We believe that our lead programs have target product profiles that may enable them to become backbone therapies in their respective lead indications, either replacing standards of care as monotherapies or enhancing treatment regimens as adjunct to existing therapies. Results from the clinical trials mentioned above will guide the potential development of our product candidates in additional indications with similar neurocircuitry deficits.
 Our Other Programs
 In addition to the lead programs described above, we plan to further characterize and appropriately advance our early clinical and preclinical pipeline across multiple potential neuroscience indications. Our other programs include:
•CVL-354, our selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist, or KORA, for the treatment of major depressive disorder, or MDD, and substance use disorder; 
 •CVL-047, our selective PDE4 inhibitor (PDE4D-sparing) for the treatment of MDD and schizophrenia;
 •our selective M4 agonist program for the treatment of psychosis and related indications;
 •CVL-936, our selective dopamine D3-preferring, D2/D3 receptor subtype antagonist for the treatment of substance use disorder; and
 •our LRRK2 inhibitor program that has the potential to address disease progression in Parkinson’s. 
 We are also pursuing other undisclosed targets, including those with disease-modifying potential for leading neuroscience diseases. These programs include those initiated by Pfizer as well as others developed internally through the application of human genetic analyses and new technology platforms, such as artificial intelligence and DNA-encoded chemical libraries, to establish novel chemical lead series that are designed to enable better understanding of therapeutic potential.
Our Approach
Below are the key pillars of our targeted approach to neuroscience:
•Targeted neurocircuitry: Fundamental to our targeted approach to neuroscience is understanding how deficits in neurocircuitry drive the development of symptoms in neuroscience diseases. Achieving optimal therapeutic benefit and minimizing unintended side effects in neuroscience diseases requires tuning the specificity and dynamic range of neural networks. Recent advancements in chemistry, genomics and proteomics have provided tools to enable targeted receptor selectivity with specificity to neural networks that underlie disease symptomatology. Fine-tuning the dynamic range of selective neurotransmitter neurocircuitry requires carefully designed receptor pharmacology, such as allosteric modulation or partial agonism, to normalize neural network function without over-activation or over-suppression.
 •Receptor subtype selectivity: A single neurotransmitter can act on multiple receptor subtypes that are expressed differentially among neuron types and neural networks within the brain and nervous system. We believe the ability to selectively target neurotransmitter receptor subtypes may provide an important opportunity to achieve maximum activity within specific neural networks while minimizing unintended interactions in other areas of the nervous system that are targeted by non-selective compounds and result in unwanted side effects. 


•Differentiated pharmacology: Neural networks in the brain operate within a dynamic range, and our understanding of disease state mechanics allows us to design molecular attributes that are intended to normalize this range for each disease. For example, classical full receptor agonism or antagonism may fully activate or inactivate neural circuits and can compensate for disease but also may limit normal functional dynamic range. However, partial agonism or allosteric modulation can correct or fine-tune the range of network signaling without fully blocking or overexciting normal activity. Each disease state represents a unique abnormality in neural network activity requiring a nuanced pharmacological approach. In addition, molecules require specific physical and metabolic properties to become a viable commercial product. Incorporating all of these characteristics into a single molecule can be extremely challenging. The evidence to date for our product candidates suggests that they may balance targeted selectivity with optimal receptor pharmacology. We believe this underscores the differentiation and therapeutic potential of our pipeline. 
 •Robust clinical and preclinical evaluation: Our clinical-stage product candidates have undergone robust clinical and preclinical testing to provide support for continued advancement through the clinical development process. In these early clinical trials and preclinical studies, we have generally observed pharmacokinetic, or PK, bioavailability, brain penetration and reduced off-target activity, that demonstrate the potential for reducing tolerability issues. In addition, dose selection is generally informed by data from these trials in addition to positron emission tomography, or PET, receptor occupancy trials and clinical biomarkers. Based on extensive characterization and research, our product candidates were designed to reproduce validated biological activity while addressing the limitations of prior known compounds. In addition, we take a rigorous approach to clinical trial design and execution. Each trial design is informed by extensive review of historical and contemporary elements including endpoint selection, inclusion and exclusion criteria and titration paradigms. Our meticulous approach to trial execution includes robust rater training, placebo response mitigation strategies and site selection based on a detailed review of historical performance. We believe the wealth of clinical and preclinical data on our compounds along with our thoughtfully designed trials strongly position our product candidates for clinical advancement.


Our Pipeline
The following table summarizes our current portfolio of programs. This table does not include multiple additional preclinical programs that have not yet been disclosed.


Our Lead Programs
Emraclidine
We are developing emraclidine for the treatment of schizophrenia. Emraclidine was rationally designed as a PAM that selectively targets the M4 receptor subtype to harness the anti-psychotic benefit believed to be associated with M4 while minimizing the cholinergic side effects typically associated with pan-muscarinic agonists. We believe emraclidine has the potential to mark a significant medical advancement as the muscarinic acetylcholine pathway has long been associated with mediation of neurotransmitter imbalance underlying psychosis. To our knowledge, emraclidine is the only M4-selective PAM currently active in clinical development.
Emraclidine demonstrated robust activity in multiple preclinical psychosis models, including potential benefit in improving cognitive endpoints. Our development plan for emraclidine is informed by thorough in vitro and in vivo PK and PD characterization as well as data from competitive muscarinic compounds. Emraclidine has been evaluated in 17 healthy volunteers and 91 patients to date, including 52 schizophrenia patients in Part B of the Phase

1b trial, which showed that it was generally well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events or treatment-related subject discontinuations.
 In June 2021, we announced positive topline results for a Phase 1b trial of emraclidine in schizophrenia, consisting of Part A, a MAD study, and Part B, a PD assessment. Emraclidine demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PANSS total score at six weeks and was generally well-tolerated compared with placebo at the two dose levels evaluated in Part B. We plan to initiate two Phase 2 clinical trials in schizophrenia and a 52-week open-label extension trial to begin development of the required safety database by the middle of 2022. Data are expected from the Phase 2 trials in the first half of 2024. In addition, we plan to evaluate the potential of this mechanism in other populations, including dementia-related psychosis.
Darigabat
We are developing darigabat for the treatment of both epilepsy and anxiety. Darigabat was rationally designed as an orally bioavailable, twice-daily PAM that selectively targets the alpha-2/3/5 subunits of the GABAA receptor. We believe that by having minimal receptor activation via the alpha-1 subunit-containing GABAA receptor, darigabat can minimize the negative side effects of sedation and potential for loss of efficacy with repeated use, or tolerance, and addiction seen with traditional non-selective GABAA receptor modulators, such as benzodiazepines, or BZDs. To our knowledge, darigabat is the only alpha-2/3/5 selective GABAA receptor PAM being evaluated in clinical trials for epilepsy.
 Darigabat has been evaluated in 343 subjects across 10 prior clinical trials. In a Phase 2, double-blind, crossover trial in photoepilepsy patients comparing darigabat to lorazepam, a commonly prescribed BZD, and to placebo, darigabat demonstrated anti-epileptic activity similar to lorazepam. In this trial, six out of seven photosensitive patients taking darigabat achieved complete suppression of epileptiform activity evoked by strobe lights. In a Phase 1 trial comparing darigabat to lorazepam, healthy volunteers were assessed using the NeuroCart CNS test battery to characterize the PD of darigabat. Compared with lorazepam, darigabat demonstrated a greater reduction in saccadic peak velocity, a biomarker indicating engagement of alpha-2/3 subunit-containing GABAA receptors, while having reduced effects on motor coordination (sedation) and cognition. In a Phase 1 MAD trial in healthy volunteers, darigabat showed no dose-related somnolence after the initial titration period, even at dose levels consistent with receptor occupancy of approximately 80%. Taken together, we believe these data suggest that darigabat may have the potential for anti-epileptic activity comparable to currently available BZDs, with reduced sedation, tolerance and withdrawal liabilities that, unlike BZDs, can be dosed chronically.
 Based on this extensive clinical data, we initiated REALIZE, a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial evaluating darigabat as an adjunctive therapy in patients with focal epilepsy, in the second half of 2020, with data expected in the second half of 2022. The focal epilepsy population is the largest subpopulation of epilepsy patients and is often studied to establish proof-of-concept in the development of an anti-epileptic drug, or AED.
In February 2022, we announced positive topline results for a Phase 1 trial of darigabat in acute anxiety in healthy volunteers. Both doses of darigabat demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant anxiolytic activity compared with placebo in this proof-of-principle trial. Darigabat was generally well-tolerated in this trial, with no serious adverse events and no discontinuations in the darigabat cohorts. We intend to pursue development of darigabat in anxiety-related disorders.
 Tavapadon
We are developing tavapadon for the treatment of both early- and late-stage Parkinson’s, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the death of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Tavapadon was rationally designed as an orally bioavailable, once-daily partial agonist that selectively targets dopamine D1/D5 receptor subtypes with the goal of balancing meaningful motor control activity with a favorable tolerability profile. To our knowledge, tavapadon is the only D1/D5 receptor partial agonist currently in clinical development for Parkinson’s and the first oral D1/D5 receptor agonist to have achieved sustained motor control improvement in Phase 2 trials of Parkinson’s.
As part of an extensive clinical program, tavapadon has been evaluated in 294 subjects across 11 prior clinical trials, including five Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers, three Phase 1/1b trials in patients with Parkinson's and three Phase 2 trials. In a Phase 2 trial in early-stage Parkinson’s, tavapadon demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference from placebo of -4.8 points on the MDS-UPDRS Part III motor score at week 15 of the treatment period. Separation from placebo was observed as early as week three while still in the titration

phase. In a Phase 2 trial in late-stage Parkinson’s, tavapadon showed a 1.0-hour improvement versus placebo in “on” time without troublesome dyskinesias at week 10 with a sustained effect observed through week 15, which we and our clinical advisors believe is clinically meaningful. Across the 11 prior clinical trials, tavapadon has consistently demonstrated what we believe to be a favorable tolerability profile as well as a PK profile with a 24-hour terminal half-life, supporting once-daily dosing.
 Based on this extensive clinical data, we initiated a registration-directed Phase 3 program beginning in January 2020, which includes TEMPO-1 and TEMPO-2 trials in early-stage Parkinson’s, TEMPO-3 in late-stage Parkinson’s and TEMPO-4, an open-label extension trial. We expect initial data from our Phase 3 program to be available beginning in the first half of 2023.
 CVL-871
We are developing CVL-871 for the treatment of dementia-related apathy. Apathy is the leading neuropsychiatric symptom in patients with dementia. It is also one of the strongest predictors of disease progression. While clinicians, patients and caregivers have been challenged by this symptom, there are no currently approved therapies for dementia-related apathy. The FDA has demonstrated interest in development of a therapy for this indication, and in June 2021, we announced that the FDA has granted Fast Track Designation for CVL-871 in dementia-related apathy. CVL-871 is a selective partial agonist of dopamine D1/D5 receptor subtypes specifically designed to achieve a modest level of partial agonism, which we believe may be useful in modulating the complex neural networks that govern cognition, motivation and apathy behaviors in neurodegenerative diseases. Dopamine acting on D1/D5 receptor subtypes in the cortex and midbrain plays a key role in the finely-tuned and dynamic neural network that modulates cognitive function, reward-processing and decision-making. In patients with Parkinson’s disease, we have observed that improving motor symptoms requires higher levels of partial agonism to offset the large losses in dopaminergic neurons in the motor cortex. In contrast, dementia patients require a more finely-tuned modulation of the neural networks that govern cognition, motivation and behavior to normalize the dynamic range of the mesocortical and mesolimbic neurocircuitry. As such, we have designed CVL-871 to have a lower level of partial agonism than tavapadon. The hypothesis for using D1/D5 receptor subtype partial agonism to treat dementia-related apathy is informed by clinical trials of other compounds where increases in dopamine activity resulted in a statistically significant improvement on apathy scales. We believe CVL-871, while potentially avoiding the cardiovascular effects of stimulant medications, may possess an optimal profile to target this new indication due to the degree to which it activates relevant dopamine circuits within the brain.
 CVL-871 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 trials in a total of 58 subjects. In these trials, CVL-871 was observed to be generally well tolerated. We also observed evidence of moderate improvement in motor symptoms, a measure of biological activity, along with a PK profile that supports the potential for once-daily dosing. Based on these findings, we submitted an Investigational New Drug, or IND, to the FDA in the first quarter of 2021 and we are conducting a Phase 2a exploratory trial in dementia-related apathy, with data expected in the first half of 2023.
 Our Other Programs
 In addition to the lead programs described above, we plan to further characterize and appropriately advance our early clinical and preclinical pipeline across multiple potential neuroscience indications. Our other programs include:
•CVL-354, our selective KORA for the treatment of MDD and substance use disorder; 
 •CVL-047, our selective PDE4 inhibitor (PDE4D-sparing) for the treatment of MDD and schizophrenia;
 •our selective M4 agonist program for the treatment of psychosis and related indications;
 •CVL-936, our selective dopamine D3-preferring, D2/D3 receptor subtype antagonist for the treatment of substance use disorder; and
 •our LRRK2 inhibitor program that has the potential to address disease progression in Parkinson’s. 


We are also pursuing other undisclosed targets, including those with disease-modifying potential for leading neuroscience diseases. These programs include evaluating those initiated by Pfizer as well as others developed internally through the application of human genetic analyses and new technology platforms, such as artificial intelligence and DNA-encoded chemical libraries to establish novel chemical lead series that is designed to enable better understanding of their therapeutic potential.
Our Strategy
We seek to transform the lives of patients with neuroscience diseases by pursuing a targeted approach to neuroscience and leveraging our deep understanding of neurocircuitry, chemistry and receptor pharmacology. Our strategy is to:
•Establish our position as a leader in neuroscience drug discovery and development through the advancement of a diverse and innovative pipeline. We leverage our differentiated understanding of neurocircuitry as well as our innovative clinical trial design and execution to develop our assets across multiple indications. In addition, we are investing in future areas of neuroscience research, including the discovery and development of compounds with disease-modifying potential for leading neuroscience diseases. 
 •Rapidly develop our lead programs. We plan to initiate two Phase 2 clinical trials of emraclidine in schizophrenia and a 52-week open-label extension trial to begin development of the required safety database by the middle of 2022. Data are expected from the Phase 2 trials in the first half of 2024. We are also conducting a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for darigabat in focal epilepsy with data expected in the second half of 2022. In February 2022, we announced positive topline results for a Phase 1 trial of darigabat in acute anxiety in healthy volunteers. We intend to pursue development of darigabat in anxiety-related disorders. In addition, we are conducting a registration-directed Phase 3 program for tavapadon, with initial data expected to be available beginning in the first half of 2023. This program includes three Phase 3 trials in both early- and late-stage Parkinson’s that will be conducted in parallel as well as an open-label extension trial. Furthermore, we are conducting an exploratory Phase 2a trial of CVL-871 for dementia-related apathy with data expected in the first half of 2023. 
 •Advance our early clinical and preclinical portfolio across multiple neuroscience indications. Among our other product candidates are: (1) CVL-354, our selective KORA for the treatment of MDD and substance use disorder; (2) CVL-047, our selective PDE4 inhibitor (PDE4D-sparing) for the treatment of MDD and schizophrenia; (3) our selective M4 agonist program for the treatment of psychosis and related indications; (4) CVL-936, our selective dopamine D3-preferring, D2/D3 receptor subtype antagonist for the treatment of substance use disorder; and (5) our LRRK2 inhibitor that has the potential to address disease progression in Parkinson’s. We are also pursuing a number of other undisclosed targets, including those with disease-modifying potential for leading neuroscience diseases. These programs include ones initiated by Pfizer as well as others developed internally through the application of new technology platforms, such as artificial intelligence and DNA-encoded chemical libraries. 
 •Efficiently allocate capital to maximize the impact of our assets. We seek to efficiently allocate capital through stepwise value creation: driving speed to proof-of-principle, speed to proof-of-concept and speed to market. For example, our early-stage clinical trials are designed to elucidate the potential of our compounds and inform future clinical trials, thereby strengthening our probability of success and our efficiency in bringing our therapies to patients. We aim to be resource- and capital-efficient in the development of our product candidates by selectively accessing complementary expertise and infrastructure through strategic partnerships or other collaborations. We are also building a leading neuroscience team that we believe has a differential ability to identify high-potential assets for acquisition or in-licensing and unlock their full value. We plan to opportunistically pursue such assets from time to time and strategically expand our portfolio. 
 •Opportunistically match sources and uses of capital. Our broad portfolio both requires and provides a basis for innovative deal making and diverse financing options. We will seek to maximize growth opportunities, which may include raising additional capital through a combination of private or public equity offerings, debt financings, royalty-based financing, collaborations, strategic alliances, marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing. By 


matching sources and uses of capital, we can maximize our value creation opportunities while mitigating operational risk through partnerships.
•Maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates and bring new therapies to underserved patient populations. Our development and commercialization strategy will be driven by our understanding of existing treatment paradigms along with patient, physician and payor needs. We expect to build a focused and efficient medical affairs and commercial organization to maximize the commercial potential of our portfolio. Our current plan is to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, in the United States and international markets, either alone or in collaboration with others.

 Our Lead Programs
 Emraclidine
We are developing emraclidine for the treatment of schizophrenia. Emraclidine was rationally designed as a PAM that selectively targets the M4 receptor subtype to harness the anti-psychotic benefit believed to be associated with M4 while minimizing the side effects typically associated with pan-muscarinic agonists. We believe emraclidine has the potential to mark a significant medical advance as the muscarinic acetylcholine pathway has long been associated with mediation of neurotransmitter imbalance and psychosis. To our knowledge, emraclidine is the only M4-selective PAM currently active in clinical development. We conducted a Phase 1b trial of emraclidine in schizophrenia, consisting of Part A, a MAD study, and Part B, a PD assessment. In June 2021, we announced

positive topline results for the Phase 1b trial. Emraclidine demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PANSS total score at six weeks and was generally well-tolerated compared with placebo at the two dose levels evaluated in Part B. We plan to initiate two Phase 2 clinical trials of emraclidine in schizophrenia and a 52-week open-label extension trial to begin development of the required safety database by the middle of 2022. Data are expected from the Phase 2 trials in the first half of 2024. In parallel, we will be prioritizing nonclinical and clinical safety pharmacology studies, including hepatic and renal insufficiency studies and an eight-week ambulatory blood pressure monitoring trial, along with other registration-enabling studies. We also plan to evaluate the potential of this mechanism in other populations, including dementia-related psychosis.
 Schizophrenia Background
Schizophrenia is a serious, complex and debilitating mental health disorder characterized by a constellation of symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech or behavior, slowed speech and blunted affect. Schizophrenia is also often associated with significant cognitive impairment, which further limits a patient’s ability to be gainfully employed and maintain relationships. Diagnosis of schizophrenia is usually made in young adulthood and the disease follows a chronic and indolent course characterized by periods of remission and relapse. People with schizophrenia have a 10 to 25-year reduction in life expectancy compared to the general population. An estimated 20 million people worldwide suffer from schizophrenia, including up to 2.1 million people in the U.S.
A disruption in the balance of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, aspartate, glycine and GABA, is believed to be responsible for the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Abnormal activity at dopamine receptors, specifically the D2 receptor subtype, in the mesolimbic pathway that results in excess dopaminergic transmission is thought to be associated with many of the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Currently available therapies for schizophrenia are all presumed to work through the antagonism of various dopamine receptors, although the exact mechanisms of action for these agents are unknown. Second-generation atypical antipsychotics, or SGAs, such as risperidone, paliperidone and aripiprazole, are recommended as first-line treatment for schizophrenia. SGAs have a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, including abnormal motor side effects, compared to first-generation antipsychotics, or FGAs, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol. However, SGAs are more likely to cause weight gain, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and dyslipidemia, leading to long-term cardiovascular morbidity. Both SGAs and FGAs can cause hyperprolactinemia, a hormonal imbalance resulting from D2 receptor blockade, which can lead to enlargement of breast tissue in males and infertility. Approximately 10% of patients are prescribed FGAs as first-line therapy, while 90% of patients start with an SGA.
Treatment selection is highly individualized and the current approach is largely one of trial and error across sequential medication choices. Using two or even three different antipsychotic agents together is common, though this practice is not encouraged given the potential for an increased risk of drug-drug interactions, side effects, non-adherence and medication errors.
Despite available therapies, only 20% of patients report favorable treatment outcomes. Medication adherence is poor in patients with schizophrenia, with a compliance rate of about 60% and a discontinuation rate of 74% within 18 months. Patients who discontinue their medication suffer from high relapse rates of 77% at one year and 90% at two years. The further progression of disease is driven by the cycle of repetitive relapse over time. Each relapse in schizophrenia marks a progression in disability, leading physicians to prioritize efficacy in selecting first-line therapy. No new therapies with novel mechanisms of action have been approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in over 20 years. There remains a significant unmet need for more effective therapies with better tolerability profiles in the treatment of schizophrenia.
Muscarinic Receptors in Schizophrenia
One of the leading theories on the etiology of schizophrenia is that an overactivity of dopamine in certain brain regions is closely associated with the prevailing psychotic symptoms. Current antipsychotics target a direct blockade of dopamine receptors. While this approach is effective at reducing symptoms, it also leads to significant side effects.
Presynaptic expression of the M4 receptor subtypes balances acetylcholine and dopamine in the striatum, which is the region of the brain primarily responsible for psychotic symptoms. The imbalance of acetylcholine and dopamine is hypothesized to contribute to psychosis in schizophrenia. Unlike other muscarinic receptors, M4 receptor subtypes are differentially expressed in the striatum. Activation of muscarinic receptors prevents acetylcholine release, which has been shown to indirectly modulate levels of dopamine without the direct D2/D3

receptor blockade that has been theorized to cause some of the unwanted motor symptoms of current antipsychotics. Thus, selective activation of M4 has the potential to treat the neurobehavioral components such as psychosis, agitation and cognitive deficits that are associated with schizophrenia and other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, while potentially mitigating some of the side effects of current antipsychotics. This mechanism of action is illustrated below:
   
   Clinical trials of xanomeline, a full muscarinic agonist that preferentially activates the M4 and M1 subtypes, demonstrated that activation of muscarinic receptors led to dose-dependent improvements in a number of psychiatric symptoms, including psychosis, cognition, agitation and aggression in both schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s patients. Despite these compelling results, further clinical development of xanomeline as a monotherapy was halted due to severe gastrointestinal side effects, including a greater than 50% discontinuation rate, which were likely mediated by non-selective muscarinic receptor activation. Furthermore, recent studies in knockout mice with the M4 receptor subtype eliminated suggest that the antipsychotic activity attributed to xanomeline is likely driven primarily by M4 and that a more selective muscarinic activator could potentially convey similar clinical benefits while minimizing gastrointestinal side effects.
Our Solution—Emraclidine
Emraclidine is a PAM that selectively targets the M4 receptor subtype. We are developing emraclidine for the treatment of schizophrenia. Key differentiating features of emraclidine include:
1.Mechanism of action—M4 receptor subtype selectivity: Based on in vitro testing, emraclidine is >600x more selective for M4 than for M1/3/5 and approximately 360x more selective for M4 than for M2. Recent preclinical studies in knockout mice with the M4 receptor subtype eliminated suggest that the antipsychotic activity attributed to xanomeline is likely driven primarily by M4 and that a more selective muscarinic activator could potentially convey similar clinical benefit while minimizing gastrointestinal side effects associated with non-selective muscarinic receptor activity. 
 2.Receptor pharmacology—PAM: Emraclidine is an orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant small molecule with an approximate nine- to 12-hour half-life. As a PAM of the M4 receptor subtype, emraclidine is designed to enhance normal neurotransmitter release without producing excessive stimulation. In addition, the available preclinical data for emraclidine suggest a low potential for drug-drug interactions, which is important in indications like schizophrenia where several drugs are often used in combination. 


3.Clinical and preclinical evaluation: Emraclidine demonstrated robust activity in multiple preclinical psychosis models, including potential benefit in improving cognitive endpoints. Our development plan is informed by thorough in vitro and in vivo PK and PD characterization of emraclidine as well as data from competitive muscarinic compounds. In June 2021, we announced positive topline results for emraclidine in our Phase 1b trial in schizophrenia and we plan to initiate two Phase 2 clinical trials of emraclidine by the middle of 2022, with data expected in the first half of 2024.
 We believe emraclidine has the potential to be a new generation antipsychotic that could become the treatment of choice for schizophrenia, if approved. Each relapse in schizophrenia marks a progression in disability, leading physicians to prioritize efficacy in selecting first-line therapy. With the potential for antipsychotic activity that we believe may exceed existing atypical antipsychotics, emraclidine could become an attractive option in newly diagnosed patients. Additionally, given its potentially improved tolerability profile relative to atypical antipsychotics, emraclidine could displace existing options for patients where there is evidence of treatment-related side effects. We also plan to evaluate the potential for this mechanism in other populations, including dementia-related psychosis.
 Clinical Trials
Emraclidine has been evaluated in a total of 17 healthy volunteers and 91 patients to date, including 52 schizophrenia patients in Part B of the Phase 1b trial. Emraclidine was generally well tolerated in all clinical trials completed to date, with no treatment-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, or treatment-related subject discontinuations. Modest, asymptomatic and transient increases from baseline relative to placebo were observed in mean supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate with initiation of treatment with emraclidine. Mean blood pressure and heart rate measures trended downward over the treatment period and, as observed in Part B of the Phase 1b trial, by week six of treatment there was no clinically meaningful increase in mean blood pressure and heart rate compared with placebo. These increases may be mediated by emraclidine’s activity on the M4 receptor subtype, either peripherally or centrally; increased heart rate has been observed in some other antipsychotic drugs due to their anticholinergic properties. In the Phase 1b trial, the incidence of nausea and other gastrointestinal adverse events, or AEs, was low and similar across all treatment groups. Emraclidine was not associated with a greater incidence of weight gain than placebo and no adverse events related to extrapyramidal symptoms were reported.
 Emraclidine demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in the PANSS total score compared with placebo at the two dose levels evaluated in Part B of the Phase 1b trial. The emraclidine 30 mg once-daily dose resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean reduction from baseline of 19.5 points in the PANSS total score and a mean reduction of 12.7 points in PANSS versus the placebo group (p=0.023). The emraclidine 20 mg twice-daily dose resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean reduction from baseline of 17.9 points in PANSS total score and a mean reduction of 11.1 points in PANSS total score compared with the placebo group (p=0.047). These results were further supported by clinically meaningful reductions in the PANSS Positive, PANSS Negative, and PANSS General Psychopathology subscales. Emraclidine has also been tested in several preclinical models that have been used to characterize known antipsychotic medications. The overall results from our preclinical studies showed the potential of emraclidine to reduce dopaminergic hyperactivation without resulting in catalepsy, or muscular rigidity.
Phase 1b Placebo-controlled Multiple Dose Trial in Schizophrenia
 In June 2021, we completed Trial NCT04136873, a two-part randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1b trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary PD of repeated daily doses of emraclidine in patients with schizophrenia. In the Part A MAD phase of the trial, doses of 5 mg to 40 mg (administered as 20 mg BID) were explored with up to 21 days of administration at target dosage. The Part A MAD safety and tolerability data were supportive of proceeding to six weeks of dosing in the subsequent Part B portion of the trial. The primary objective of Part B was to further characterize the safety and tolerability of target doses selected from the MAD investigation of emraclidine in Part A in participants with acute schizophrenia; the PK of emraclidine was assessed as a secondary endpoint. In addition, we conducted an exploratory PD assessment that included the PANSS total score and the associated positive, negative, and general psychopathology subscales. The PANSS total score ranges from 30 to 210 points and is based on the sum of 30 items rated from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.


In Part B, adult patients with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia who were 55 years and younger were eligible for the trial. Inclusion criteria included a CGI-S score of at least 4 (moderately to severely ill) and a PANSS total score of at least 80 at screening, a history of relapse and/or symptom exacerbation when not receiving antipsychotic medication, and current acute exacerbation of psychosis with onset within two months. Key exclusion criteria included patients with schizophrenia who were considered resistant or refractory to antipsychotic treatment. All patients were washed out of their current antipsychotic medications prior to participating in the trial.
A total of 81 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to emraclidine at a dose of 20 mg BID, 30 mg QD, or placebo for a total of six weeks. Six patients discontinued from the trial in each treatment group and a total of 63 patients completed the trial. The majority of participants were male (78%) and black (69%) and the mean age was 40 years. The mean baseline PANSS total score was 95; baseline demographic and disease characteristics were distributed evenly across treatment groups.
 Safety and Tolerability Data
 In general, the tolerability profile of emraclidine was favorable, with comparable incidence of AEs compared with placebo, no SAEs associated with treatment, and no evidence of extrapyramidal symptoms, metabolic effects, gastrointestinal effects, or weight gain compared with placebo. SAEs included one instance each of COVID-19 (emraclidine 20 mg BID), accidental cocaine overdose (emraclidine 30 mg QD) and exacerbation of schizophrenia (emraclidine 30 mg QD); none of the SAEs were considered related to the study drug. The table below summarizes the most common adverse events.

Modest, asymptomatic increases from baseline relative to placebo were observed in mean supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in both emraclidine groups with initiation of treatment. Mean blood pressure and heart rate measures trended downward for both emraclidine groups over the treatment period, such that by week six, there was no clinically meaningful increase in mean blood pressure and heart rate compared with placebo. The chart below summarizes the change from baseline on systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate for each treatment group at week six.



   Pharmacodynamics
 Both doses of emraclidine demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant antipsychotic effects, with no meaningful differences in gastrointestinal side effects, extrapyramidal symptoms or weight gain compared with placebo. The 30 mg once-daily group demonstrated an improvement of 19.5 while the 20 mg twice daily cohort showed an improvement of 17.9 from baseline on the PANSS total score after six weeks of treatment. Both treatment groups had statistically significant reductions relative to placebo of 12.7 and 11.1 respectively, with p-values less than 0.05. These results were further supported by statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the PANSS-negative subscale for both doses – the 30 mg once daily group resulted in a point improvement of 3.1 over placebo with a p-value of 0.009 and the 20 mg twice daily group showed a 3.7 improvement over placebo with a p-value of 0.002. We also observed clinically meaningful improvements on the PANSS positive subscale for both doses, with the 30 mg once-daily group demonstrating a statistically significant reduction of 4.3 points versus placebo. The table and chart below summarize the change in PANSS total score from baseline over the treatment period.

 Preclinical Studies
Emraclidine was tested in several preclinical models that have been used to characterize known antipsychotic medications. The overall results from our preclinical studies showed the potential of emraclidine to reduce dopaminergic hyperactivation without resulting in catalepsy. In a mouse study, emraclidine significantly decreased both spontaneous and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion activity to levels similar to haloperidol, which is considered one of the most potent antipsychotics. Furthermore, in a rat pre-pulse inhibition model, an electrical deficit model translatable to patients with schizophrenia, emraclidine demonstrated a dose-dependent improvement in amphetamine-induced deficits. In order to further explore the potential to affect other symptoms of schizophrenia, like cognitive impairment, emraclidine was evaluated in a study in rats that measured various aspects of memory function. The results showed improvement in both episodic and working memory, suggesting a potential opportunity for emraclidine to be differentiated compared to existing medications for schizophrenia.

Planned Clinical Trials
Based on the results of the Phase 1b trial in schizophrenia, we plan to initiate in parallel two double-blind, placebo-controlled three-arm Phase 2 clinical trials of emraclidine in schizophrenia and a 52-week open-label extension trial to begin development of the required safety database by the middle of 2022. These trials are designed to enable the full exploration of the therapeutic dose range of emraclidine. Data are expected from the Phase 2 trials in the first half of 2024.
 Each trial will enroll approximately 372 schizophrenia patients with acute exacerbation or relapse of psychotic symptoms. Patients will include men and women between the ages of 18 and 65 and inclusion criteria will include PANSS total scores between 85 and 120 and CGI-S scores of at least 4 at baseline. In each trial, patients will be randomized 1:1:1 into one of two emraclidine dose arms or placebo. The trial will include a screening period of up to 15 days and six weeks of in-patient treatment. The first trial will include emraclidine 10 mg once-daily, emraclidine 30 mg once-daily and placebo. The second trial will include emraclidine 15 mg once-daily, emraclidine 30 mg once-daily and placebo. All emraclidine doses will be administered once-daily without titration. The two trials have identical designs with the exception of the emraclidine doses.
 The primary endpoint for the trials will be change in the PANSS total score at week six. The key secondary endpoint will be change in the CGI-S. Additional endpoints will include the PANSS positive and PANNS negative subscale scores, the Marder Factor scores and the PANSS responder rate, defined as the percentage of patients with at least 30% reduction from baseline in the PANSS total score. Other measures will include the Short-Form Six-Dimension, or SF-6D, which is a quality-of-life measure, and the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia, or the BACS.
 The diagrams below summarize the design of the two trials:
 

   In parallel, we will be prioritizing nonclinical and clinical safety pharmacology studies, including hepatic and renal insufficiency studies and an eight-week ambulatory blood pressure monitoring trial, along with other registration-enabling studies.

Darigabat
We are developing darigabat for the treatment of both epilepsy and anxiety. Darigabat was rationally designed as an orally bioavailable, twice-daily PAM that selectively targets the alpha-2/3/5 subunits of the GABAA receptor. We believe that by having minimal activity via the alpha-1 subunit-containing GABAA receptor, darigabat can minimize the negative side effects of sedation and potential for tolerance and addiction seen with traditional non-selective GABAA receptor modulators, such as BZDs. To our knowledge, darigabat is the only alpha-2/3/5-selective GABAA receptor PAM being evaluated in clinical trials for epilepsy. Based on extensive clinical and preclinical data generated to date, including positive data from a Phase 2 proof-of-principle photoepilepsy trial, we initiated REALIZE, a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients with focal epilepsy, in the second half of 2020, with data expected in the second half of 2022. The focal epilepsy population is the largest subpopulation of epilepsy patients and is often studied to establish proof-of-concept in the development of an AED. In February 2022, we announced positive topline results for a Phase 1 trial of darigabat in acute anxiety in healthy volunteers. Both doses of darigabat demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant anxiolytic activity compared with placebo in this proof-of-principle trial. Darigabat was generally well-tolerated in this trial, with no serious adverse events and no discontinuations in the darigabat cohorts. We intend to pursue development of darigabat in anxiety-related disorders.
Epilepsy Background
Epilepsy is a chronic disorder of the CNS that is characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures arising from abnormal electrical discharges in the brain. This may result in alterations of consciousness, involuntary movement or altered sensations. Epilepsy may be related to a brain injury or heredity, but often the cause is unknown. A person is diagnosed as having epilepsy when they have had at least two unprovoked seizures. Epileptic seizures are categorized in two major groups: generalized onset seizures and focal onset seizures. Generalized onset seizures begin with a widespread electrical discharge that involves both sides of the brain at once. Focal onset seizures begin with an electrical discharge in one limited area of the brain.
According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Epilepsy Foundation, approximately 65 million people suffer from epilepsy worldwide. An estimated 57% of all patients with epilepsy experience focal onset seizures while the remaining patients are classified as either having generalized onset seizures (32%) or unknown onset seizures (11%).
The current standard of care for epilepsy is treatment with one or more AEDs, which act through diverse mechanisms of action to reduce abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Example mechanisms include voltage- gated ion channel inhibitors, presynaptic proteins and neurotransmitter receptors such as GABAA receptors. Some AEDs have multiple mechanisms and some have only one known mechanism, but many AEDs have dose-limiting side effects and tolerability issues and some patients on AEDs may continue to experience ongoing seizures despite treatment.
Treatment initiation typically starts with a single AED, with dose escalation until seizure control is achieved or AEs become intolerable. Levetiracetam (Keppra), carbamazepine or lamotrigine are often used as a first-line therapy among newly diagnosed patients. Patients who do not respond to monotherapy are started on adjuvant therapy with a preference for a drug with a different mechanism of action. Adding on or switching to new therapies is driven by breakthrough seizures, which indicate suboptimal efficacy, and tolerability issues. Shortcomings of available therapies include adverse effects such as sedation, ataxia (the presence of abnormal, uncoordinated movements), cognitive impairment, agitation, weight gain and tolerance.
Despite the existence of over 30 approved AEDs, approximately 30% of epilepsy patients fail to achieve seizure control even with the use of two or more AEDs (whether as monotherapy or in combination), which the International League Against Epilepsy defines as being drug-resistant. Inability to control seizures may result in severe disability, inability to retain employment and increased rates of mortality. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, or SUDEP, is the leading cause of death in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy.
BZDs have been important agents in the management of epilepsy for over 50 years. Of currently available therapies, BZDs are highly efficacious AEDs and may be administered via multiple routes. However, their use is primarily limited to acute or rescue treatment because they are associated with the development of tolerance resulting from repeated use, side effects such as cognitive impairment and sedation, as well as the development of physical and psychological dependence. BZDs commonly used for the acute management of seizures include clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam and clobazam. More than 10 BZDs are available and

may be prescribed for treatment of seizures. Clobazam and clonazepam are BZDs approved for chronic adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, a rare childhood form of epilepsy. Given their drawbacks, including debilitating side effects, risk of withdrawal and development of tolerance, BZDs are not typically prescribed for chronic treatment of focal epilepsy or generalized epilepsy.
GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter that dampens down neuronal hyperexcitation through hyperpolarization. GABAA receptors are comprised of five subunits and are classified into three major groups (alpha, beta and gamma) and several minor groups. BZDs are non-selective PAMs of the GABAA receptor, enhancing the effect of GABAA receptors containing alpha-1/2/3/5 subunits. Alpha-1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors are broadly expressed throughout the brain and their modulation is believed to underlie many tolerability issues associated with BZD use (including sedation, motor and cognitive impairment) and contribute to desensitization and tolerance. In preclinical studies, the sedative effects of BZDs have been attributed to alpha-1 containing receptors. The role of alpha-1 in sedation is further supported by the clinical use of alpha-1 selective non-BZD Z-drugs such as zolpidem, which are used to treat insomnia. Meanwhile, alpha-2/3/5 containing GABAA receptors are expressed in more discrete brain regions, primarily within the cortical and thalamic neural networks. In preclinical studies, the anticonvulsant effects of BZDs have been attributed to alpha-1/2, the anxiolytic effects to alpha-2/3, analgesic activity to alpha-2/3/5 and some of the effects on memory function to alpha-5. As such, we believe selectively targeting the alpha-2/3/5 subunits present an attractive treatment option for epilepsy.
Anxiety Background
Anxiety disorders are the most common form of mental illness in the United States, affecting over 45 million adults or 15% of the U.S. population. Globally, over 370 million people are impacted by an anxiety disorder of some kind. The most common types of anxiety disorders include panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or GAD, and social anxiety. The social impact of anxiety disorders includes increased risk of suicide, reduced achievement in work and school, increased risk of absenteeism, co-morbid depression, potential for substance abuse and higher healthcare costs.
 Panic disorder is a common anxiety disorder with an estimated global lifetime prevalence varying between 1.7% and 4.7% in general population samples. Panic disorder may cause significant psychological and physical distress and is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks that disrupt activities of daily living. Patients with panic attacks experience persistent concern about having additional attacks and worry about the implications of the attack or its consequences. Panic disorder can also be associated with a significant change in behavior related to the attacks, such as agoraphobia.
GAD is a chronic condition characterized by excessive anxiety and worry that is out of proportion to actual context and causes significant distress or functional impairment. GAD is a common disorder affecting approximately 5.7% of individuals at some point in their life, with approximately one-third of cases considered to be severe. Rates of full remission have been observed to be low, with recovery rates of less than 60% after a 12-year follow-up. In clinical trials of approved treatments, the rates of remission observed are typically less than 50%.
Treatment for anxiety typically consists of a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and medication. First-line medications for anxiety include antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, and buspirone, a serotonin 5HT1A receptor agonist. SSRIs, SNRIs and buspirone are used chronically, but they provide only modest relief and their onset of action is slow, taking up to four or more weeks before providing symptom relief. BZDs, which are broad spectrum GABAA receptor modulators, are known to have strong anxiolytic activity. While highly efficacious, tolerance along with known side effects of BZDs, such as sedation and cognitive impairment, as well as the development of physical and psychological dependence limit their use to short-term treatment or acute anxiety attacks. Due to a lack of sufficient treatment options, diazepam, clonazepam, lorazepam and alprazolam remain commonly prescribed anxiolytics despite their shortcomings. BZDs are often prescribed in combination with SSRIs and SNRIs to provide symptom relief while waiting for those medications to take effect. In addition, treatment-resistant patients are adjunctively administered BZDs despite the potential for abuse and symptom exacerbation.
We believe that by selectively targeting the alpha-2/3/5 subunits of the GABAA receptor and sparing the alpha-1 subunit, darigabat has the potential to provide BZD-like anxiolytic activity with an improved tolerability profile that could enable patients to move from the current standard of episodic dosing to a daily maintenance treatment regimen. In particular, we believe darigabat has the potential to minimize or avoid tolerability issues seen

with BZDs that mostly limit them to acute, episodic use, such as sedation, risk of abuse, withdrawal and development of tolerance.
Our Solution—Darigabat
 Darigabat is a selective PAM that targets GABAA receptors containing alpha-2/3/5 receptor subunits. We are developing darigabat for the treatment of epilepsy and anxiety. Key differentiating features of darigabat include:
1.Mechanism of action—alpha-2/3/5 containing GABAA receptor selectivity: Darigabat is designed to selectively enhance GABA’s inhibitory effect at the alpha-2/3/5 subunit-containing GABAA receptors, which is expected to suppress aberrant overexcitation that underlies epileptic activity. Although darigabat binds to alpha-1 subunit containing GABAA receptors, it is functionally selective for alpha-2/3/5 subunit-containing GABAA receptors. Darigabat exhibits significant positive allosteric modulation of alpha-2/3/5 subunit-containing GABAA receptors (90-140%) but only negligible activity (20%) at GABAA receptors containing alpha-1 subunits. Because of its minimal effect on the alpha-1 subunit, we believe darigabat is able to achieve high receptor occupancy within the CNS while potentially reducing the dose-limiting side effects and tolerance associated with alpha-1 containing GABAA receptors. This mechanism of action is illustrated below:
 
    
2.Receptor pharmacology—PAM: Darigabat is an orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant, twice-daily small molecule with a novel selectivity profile. Darigabat is designed as a PAM to increase the effect of endogenous GABA without blocking or overexciting normal neural activity and with a lower propensity for development of tolerance. Furthermore, reduced functional activity at alpha-2 subunit containing GABAA receptors of darigabat relative to the non-selective BZDs has the potential to minimize receptor desensitization that leads to the development of tolerance. We believe anticonvulsant activity with this optimized activity at alpha-2 subunit-containing GABAA receptors of darigabat is then achieved 


potentially through high levels of receptor occupancy due to minimal activity at alpha-1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors. Based on PET characterization, doses of darigabat used in clinical trials reached at least 80% receptor occupancy without causing dose-limiting AEs; notably, to date, there have been no reports of sedation with single doses of darigabat up to 100 mg and multiple doses up to 42.5 mg BID. In contrast, non-selective BZDs cause sedation at receptor occupancy levels of approximately 10-20%.
 3.Clinical and preclinical evaluation: Darigabat has been evaluated in 343 subjects, including healthy volunteers and patients across multiple indications. Across 10 completed clinical trials, darigabat was generally well tolerated. In a Phase 1 multiple-dose trial in healthy volunteers, darigabat administration resulted in no reports of sedation and low rates of somnolence compared to that reported with the commonly prescribed BZD lorazepam that generally resolved after titration, even up to dose levels consistent with receptor occupancy of approximately 80%. In addition, darigabat has demonstrated clinical proof-of-principle in a Phase 2 photoepilepsy trial and anti-epileptic activity in multiple rodent models of epilepsy. In February 2022, we announced positive topline results for a Phase 1 trial of darigabat in acute anxiety in healthy volunteers. Both doses of darigabat demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant anxiolytic activity compared with placebo in this proof-of-principle trial. Darigabat was generally well-tolerated in this trial, with no serious adverse events and no discontinuations in the darigabat cohorts.
 Based on these differentiating features, we believe darigabat has the potential for anti-epileptic and anxiolytic activity comparable to currently available BZDs but with reduced tolerance, sedation and withdrawal liabilities, which may enable chronic use.
For newly-diagnosed patients, we believe darigabat has the potential to become first-line therapy given the limitations of existing treatments in balancing anti-epileptic activity with acceptable tolerability. For patients on polypharmacy experiencing tolerability issues, darigabat’s novel mechanism of action and expected tolerability profile has the potential to enable physicians to replace (after a cross-taper) a higher-risk drug in a patient’s regimen. Additionally, for patients on multiple medications who experience breakthrough seizures, the target receptor selectivity and potential improved tolerability profile suggest that darigabat could be added to their current regimen for seizure control.
In anxiety, we believe darigabat has the potential to provide anxiolytic benefit while minimizing the limiting tolerability effects of non-selective GABAA PAMs such as BZDs, with the possibility of shifting the treatment paradigm from episodic use of BZDs in response to anxiety attacks to a well-tolerated, daily maintenance regimen.
 Pending the results of our planned trials, we believe darigabat could potentially change the paradigm of care for epilepsy and anxiety, moving GABAA receptor modulators earlier in the treatment paradigm and from acute therapy to chronic therapy.
Clinical Trials
Darigabat has been evaluated in 343 subjects across 10 prior clinical trials in both patients and healthy volunteers. In a Phase 2, double-blind, crossover trial in photoepilepsy patients comparing darigabat to the commonly prescribed BZD lorazepam and to placebo, darigabat demonstrated anti-epileptic activity similar to lorazepam. In this trial, six out of seven patients taking darigabat achieved complete suppression of epileptiform activity evoked by flashing lights. In a Phase 1 trial comparing darigabat to lorazepam, healthy volunteers were assessed using the NeuroCart CNS test battery. Compared to lorazepam, darigabat demonstrated a greater reduction in saccadic peak velocity, a biomarker indicating engagement of selective alpha-2/3 subunit-containing GABAA receptors, while having reduced effects on motor coordination and cognition. Furthermore, in a Phase 1 MAD trial, darigabat showed no dose-related somnolence, even at dose levels consistent with receptor occupancy of approximately 80%. In addition, across several multiple-dose trials, darigabat has shown no evidence of withdrawal effects, a common problem with BZDs. Along with PK, PD and safety margin analyses, dose selection for trials with darigabat was informed by a Phase 1 PET receptor occupancy trial in healthy volunteers. Taken together, we believe these data suggest that darigabat may have the potential for anti-epileptic activity comparable to currently available BZDs, with reduced sedation, tolerance and withdrawal liabilities. We initiated a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients with focal epilepsy in the second half of 2020, with data expected in the second half of 2022. In February 2022, we announced positive topline results for a Phase 1 trial of darigabat in acute anxiety in healthy volunteers. Both doses of darigabat demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant anxiolytic

activity compared with placebo in this proof-of-principle trial. Darigabat was generally well-tolerated in this trial, with no serious adverse events and no discontinuations in the darigabat cohorts. We intend to pursue development of darigabat in anxiety-related disorders.
 The table below provides an overview of all clinical trials of darigabat completed to date, including trials in indications other than epilepsy.

 Selected Darigabat Clinical Trials
Phase 1 Trial in Acute Anxiety
 In February 2022, we announced positive topline results for a Phase 1 trial of darigabat in acute anxiety in healthy volunteers. The Phase 1 proof-of-principle trial was a three-cohort, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, crossover trial in healthy volunteers. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the anxiolytic effects of multiple doses of darigabat using an experimental medicine model of carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation that is associated with symptoms of anxiety/panic in healthy volunteers. This model is known to be sensitive to the effects of drugs approved for the treatment of anxiety, including benzodiazepines and SSRIs.
 This trial was designed with a maximum duration of approximately thirteen weeks and consisted of a screening/baseline period, a treatment period and a follow-up period. During the screening/baseline period, subjects were exposed to the CO2 challenge, and only subjects who were sensitive to the anxiogenic effects of 35% CO2 double-breath inhalation at screening were eligible for randomization during the treatment period. Each treatment period consisted of eight days of dosing followed by the CO2 challenge performed after dosing on Day 8. Adverse events were reported via participant queries approximately four times daily. The trial was conducted as a two-period, two-sequence crossover design comparing multiple doses of high-dose darigabat (25 mg BID), low-dose darigabat (7.5 mg BID), and alprazolam (1 mg BID) against placebo. Three cohorts of 18 subjects, for a total of 54 subjects, completed the trial. The primary endpoint of the trial was the change in the Panic Symptoms List, or

PSL-IV, total score, which includes 13 symptoms scored across a range of 0 (absent) to 4 (very intense) and is commonly used to assess panic/anxiety. The design of this trial is illustrated below:
 

Pharmacodynamic Results
 After eight days of treatment, the darigabat 7.5 mg and 25 mg twice-daily doses demonstrated a 3.9 point (p=0.036) and 4.5 point (p=0.008) placebo-adjusted improvement, respectively, on the primary endpoint of the Panic Symptoms List (PSL-IV) total score. The alprazolam 1 mg twice-daily dose demonstrated a 1.6 point (p=0.286) placebo-adjusted improvement on the PSL-IV total score. These results are illustrated below:
 



These positive results were further supported by the secondary endpoint, change in the Fear Visual Analog Scale, or VAS Fear score, which demonstrated a 12.8 point (p=0.026), 7.8 point (p=0.282), and 0.9 point (p=0.876) placebo-adjusted improvement for the darigabat 7.5 mg, 25 mg, and alprazolam 1 mg twice-daily doses, respectively. These results are illustrated below:
 


Darigabat was generally well-tolerated in this trial, with no SAEs and no treatment-related discontinuations in the darigabat cohorts. Ninety-seven percent of AEs reported in the two darigabat treatment cohorts were considered mild. The remainder were considered moderate and there were no severe AEs in the darigabat treatment arms.

The most common AEs included bradyphrenia, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue and disturbance in attention, and the AEs observed were consistent with previous trials of darigabat in healthy volunteers. The AEs with an incidence greater than or equal to 10% in any active arm which were observed more frequently than placebo are summarized below.

This trial demonstrated the anxiolytic potential of darigabat based on reduction of acute anxiety/panic evoked by CO2 inhalation in healthy subjects. We intend to pursue development of darigabat in anxiety-related disorders.
 Phase 2 Trial in Photoepilepsy
In February 2017, Pfizer completed Trial B7431005, a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, cross- over, proof-of-principle, Phase 2 trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of darigabat in photoepilepsy using lorazepam as an active control.
Pharmacological effects in photoepilepsy proof-of-principle trials are correlated with a higher likelihood that positive results will be observed in the clinical epilepsy population. As such, it has historically been utilized as a tool to quantitatively predict efficacy in epilepsy. Doses corresponding to a 50% to 100% response in these proof-of-principle trials for a range of well-precedented and clinically characterized anticonvulsive agents were found to be within two-fold of the minimally efficacious doses used in focal or generalized epilepsy. These data provide support for the translatability of the photoepilepsy model to other epilepsy states.
A total of seven patients with documented photoepilepsy were randomized to the four-period crossover trial examining single doses of 17.5 mg and 52.5 mg of darigabat, 2 mg of lorazepam as an active control and placebo, with each patient receiving all treatments in a random order with a one-to-three week washout between treatments. The 52.5 mg dose of darigabat was selected for the trial based on the expectation that it would achieve maximal PD effect in the alpha-2/3 saccadic peak velocity biomarker assessment and maximal receptor occupancy of approximately 80%. The lower 17.5 mg dose of darigabat was expected to achieve approximately 60% receptor occupancy.
Patients were exposed to intermittent bursts of light with different flash frequencies (intermittent photic stimulation) to establish the standardized photosensitivity range, or SPR, at which electroencephalographic, or EEG epileptiform activity (photoparoxysmal response, or PPR) was observed. Flashes were administered at standard frequencies, with the SPR being the range of frequencies over which EEG epileptiform activity occurred. The maximum SPR was 14 with a minimum of 0, where an SPR of 0 indicates complete suppression of EEG epileptiform activity.
The primary endpoint was the average change in SPR over the first six hours post-treatment. As measured by SPR, the mean response of 17.5 mg and 52.5 mg of darigabat compared to placebo in the most sensitive eye condition was -6.2 and -5.4, respectively. The mean response of 2 mg of lorazepam compared to placebo was -5.2.

Mean responses for 17.5 mg and 52.5 mg of darigabat and 2 mg of lorazepam were considered similar to each other and statistically significant relative to placebo at the prespecified one-sided 5% level. Results are summarized in the table and chart below.
   
Treatment | LSMean(90% CI) | LSMean vs. Placebo(90% CI)
Placebo | 6.80 (5.14 to 8.48) | 
Darigabat 17.5 mg | 0.57 (-1.12 to 2.26) | -6.23 (-8.60 to -3.86) 
Darigabat 52.5 mg | 1.38 (-0.29 to 3.04) | -5.42 (-7.78 to -3.06) 
Lorazepam 2 mg | 1.58 (-0.11 to 3.26) | -5.22 (-7.60 to -2.84) 

Standardized Photosensitive Range
Darigabat vs. Lorazepam vs. Placebo



The proportion of participants with complete suppression, partial response and no response to intermittent photic stimulation is summarized in the table below. Six out of seven patients had complete suppression of EEG epileptiform activity following receipt of 17.5 mg of darigabat, 52.5 mg of darigabat or 2 mg of lorazepam, whereas two out of seven patients had complete suppression following receipt of placebo. Based on these results, along with PK data and PET receptor occupancy-based modeling, we believe that both doses of darigabat in this trial are within the anticipated therapeutic range for anti-seizure effect.
Summary of Proportion of Participants with Categorical Responses in the Most Sensitive Eye Condition
   
Response(a) | Placebo | Darigabat 17.5 mg | Darigabat 52.5 mg | Lorazepam 2 mg
Complete suppression | 2/7 | 6/7 | 6/7 | 6/7 
Partial response | 0/7 | 0/7 | 0/7 | 0/7 
No response | 5/7 | 1/7 | 1/7 | 1/7 

 (a)Responses defined as follows: Complete suppression: SPR = 0 in all 3 eye conditions at the same time point; Partial response: a reduction in SPR of at least 3 units from baseline for at least 3 time points and no timepoints with at least 3 units of increase, in the most sensitive eye condition, without meeting the complete suppression definition; No response: does not meet complete suppression or partial response definitions. 


Consistent with previous trials in healthy volunteers and patients, darigabat was observed to be well tolerated. The most frequently reported AEs in this single-dose trial were somnolence (three subjects each on placebo, 17.5 mg of darigabat and 2 mg of lorazepam and four subjects on 52.5 mg of darigabat) and dizziness (three subjects each on 17.5 mg and 52.5 mg of darigabat and one subject on 2 mg of lorazepam). One of the dizziness AEs and two of the somnolence AEs were moderate in severity. All other somnolence and dizziness AEs were mild in severity. There were no SAEs and no discontinuations due to AEs in this trial. Based on the totality of clinical data for darigabat to date, including the Phase 1 MAD trial in healthy volunteers described below, we believe that titration can help mitigate effects on somnolence and dizziness.
 In summary, in this trial, darigabat demonstrated pronounced anticonvulsant activity on par with lorazepam, in patients with photoepilepsy, a clinical epilepsy model translationally relevant to other epilepsy populations.
Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose Trial with Pharmacodynamic Assessments
In July 2014, Pfizer completed Trial B7431001, a first-in-human Phase 1 trial designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of single doses of darigabat in healthy adult volunteers between 18 and 55 years old.
The primary objectives of this trial were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating single oral doses of darigabat, as well as the PK and PD of single doses of darigabat alone and in combination with lorazepam in healthy volunteers. PD effects were assessed using NeuroCart, a test battery which assesses a range of CNS functions, both objective, such as neurophysiologic and cognition, and subjective, such as memory and mood. NeuroCart can be used to correlate a compound’s PD activity and PK and provide evidence to test hypotheses regarding mechanism of action. NeuroCart PD measurements rationally selected for this trial were based on known GABAA receptor pharmacology and included:
•Saccadic peak velocity, or SPV, where a reduction is an indicator of desired alpha-2/3 pharmacology 
 •Body sway and adaptive tracking to assess undesired alpha-1 pharmacology related to sedation 
 •Visual-verbal learning test, or VVLT, to assess memory impairment and undesired alpha-1/5 pharmacology 
 The trial was conducted in two parts. The first part of the trial (Cohorts 1, 2 and 3) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, SAD trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of single escalating doses of darigabat. Eight subjects in each cohort received darigabat and the remaining two subjects received placebo. Cohorts 1 and 2 were dosed with the first 10 dose levels of darigabat (0.04 mg to 15 mg). Cohort 3 evaluated doses from 25 mg to 100 mg.
The second part of the trial (Cohort 4) was conducted to further explore and compare NeuroCart PD effects of darigabat alone, 2 mg of lorazepam alone and the combination of darigabat with 2 mg of lorazepam. This was done to explore the PD interaction between the two drugs. Part 2 of the trial was designed as a five-period placebo- and active-controlled crossover trial. Fifteen subjects each received placebo, 2 mg of lorazepam, 15 mg of darigabat, 65 mg of darigabat and 65 mg of darigabat in combination with 2 mg of lorazepam in accordance with one of the sequences shown in the table below.

Lorazepam has been studied extensively using NeuroCart and has a distinctive signature of its GABAA receptor related pharmacology, including effects on saccadic eye movements as well as undesired effects on alertness, memory and body sway, many of which are believed to be mediated through alpha-1 pharmacology.
PD activity of darigabat in this trial was observed for the desired alpha-2/3 driven pharmacology, as demonstrated by SPV and surpassed the effect size demonstrated by lorazepam. The undesired, primarily alpha-1-driven pharmacology, as demonstrated by body sway and adaptive tracking, was observed to be lower for darigabat than with lorazepam. The full results from this trial are summarized below:
•Effects on alpha-2/3 pharmacology: SPV decreased with increasing doses of darigabat. In Cohort 4, the decrease in SPV for each of darigabat 15 mg and 65 mg and for the combination of 2 mg of lorazepam and 65 mg of darigabat was statistically significantly greater than for 2 mg of lorazepam alone. 
 •Effects on alpha-1 pharmacology (associated with sedation): Body sway increased with increasing doses of darigabat up to 10 mg, and appeared to plateau between 10 mg and 100 mg. In Cohort 4, the increase in body sway was statistically significantly lower for 15 mg of darigabat than for 2 mg of lorazepam. Adaptive tracking decreased with increasing doses of up to 25 mg of darigabat, and appeared to plateau between 25 mg and 100 mg. In Cohort 4, there was a statistically significant reduction in the impairment on adaptive tracking for both 15 mg and 65 mg of darigabat and the combination of 2 mg of lorazepam and 65 mg of darigabat when compared to 2 mg of lorazepam alone. 
 •Effects on alpha-1/5 pharmacology (associated with memory and cognition): For VVLT, the numbers of correct words were decreased on both the immediate recall and delayed recall for both doses of darigabat relative to placebo. These effects were not statistically significantly different to 2 mg of lorazepam. The numbers of incorrect words on both immediate and delayed recall were similar to placebo for doses of darigabat and significantly lower than 2 mg of lorazepam. The number of correct words recognized after a period of time (delayed recognition) was decreased relative to placebo but were higher than 2 mg of lorazepam (statistically significant for darigabat 15 mg). Average reaction time and the standard deviation of reaction time for correct words generally increased with doses of darigabat but by less than that observed for 2 mg of lorazepam in Cohort 4. 
 Dose-response effects of darigabat were also observed on saccadic reaction time, saccadic inaccuracy, visual analogue alertness and average reaction time for correct words.

Results from Part 2 of the trial, illustrated in the table below, demonstrated that, overall, darigabat showed a differentiated profile to lorazepam. Relative to 2 mg of lorazepam, 15 mg of darigabat demonstrated a larger decrease in SPV, corresponding to desired alpha-2/3 pharmacology, and a smaller impairment versus lorazepam on body sway, adaptive tracking and memory tests, corresponding to undesirable alpha-1/5 pharmacology seen with BZDs. The combination of darigabat and lorazepam (not illustrated) showed greater decrease in SPV and less reduction in adaptive tracking in comparison to lorazepam alone, suggesting little PD interaction between the two compounds.
 


All doses of darigabat were observed to be well tolerated. All treatment-related and trial-related AEs reported were mild. A maximum tolerated dose was not established and there were no reports of sedation in the trial. The most common AEs following dosing with darigabat were somnolence, dizziness, bradyphrenia, headache, fatigue, elevated mood and orthostatic hypotension.
Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose Trial in Healthy Volunteers
In February 2018, Pfizer completed Trial B7431011, a double-blind, randomized trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of repeat oral doses of darigabat in healthy adult volunteers.
Eighteen healthy adult volunteers were enrolled and randomized into two cohorts and received twice daily, or BID, oral doses of darigabat over 21 days. One additional patient was enrolled into the trial but was withdrawn due to non-compliance. Each cohort included seven or eight subjects dosed with darigabat and two subjects dosed with placebo. All subjects received increasing doses of darigabat during the titration period in the first seven days, and the target dose was maintained for the remaining 14 days of the treatment period. In Cohort 1, subjects received 5 mg BID for three days, 12.5 mg BID for four days and 25 mg BID for 14 days. In Cohort 2, subjects received 5 mg BID for two days, 12.5 mg BID for two days, 25 mg BID for three days and 42.5 mg BID for 14 days. Serial PK samples were collected at selected time points on days one and 21. Safety evaluations conducted throughout the trial included AE monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, or ECGs, and physical examinations.
Darigabat was rapidly absorbed with Cmax achieved at a median Tmax of one to two hours following both single- and multiple-dose administration. Mean terminal half-life on day 21 was 11.2 hours (25 mg BID) and 11.5 hours (42.5 mg BID), providing a PK rationale for twice-daily dosing.

All reported AEs were mild and a maximum tolerated dose was not identified. As illustrated below, no subjects reported somnolence after the titration period and no somnolence was observed in the 42.5 mg BID group.
   
 | Reaction | Week 1(Titration) | | Week 2(Maintenance) | | | Week 3(Maintenance) | | | Follow-Up
 | No Reaction | 4/4 | | 4/4 | | | 3/4 | | | 4/4

42.5mg BID | Dizziness | 3/7 | | 1/7 | | | 1/7 | | | 1/7 
 | Somnolence | | — | | | — | | | | — | | | —

 
No trial participants experienced withdrawal symptoms when darigabat was discontinued, despite treatment with doses achieving an estimated 80% GABAA receptor occupancy based on modeling data from the PET trial (B7431004). Changes in micronuclei frequency were measured as an exploratory endpoint in this trial and no changes were observed, providing further evidence that the doses evaluated were below the threshold at which micronuclei formation was observed preclinically.
Based on the results of this trial, which included a dose that exceeded our top target dose for our ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in focal epilepsy, we believe darigabat may selectively enhance alpha-2/3/5 GABAergic activity at high receptor occupancy levels without sedation and minimal somnolence that is associated with alpha-1 subunit-containing receptors activation.

 Ongoing Clinical Trials
REALIZE: Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Trial in Focal Epilepsy
We are investigating darigabat in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in approximately 150 patients with focal epilepsy. The focal epilepsy population is the largest subpopulation of epilepsy patients, and it is often studied to establish proof-of-concept in AED development. The diagram below summarizes the design of the trial:
   


This trial is designed to be a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of darigabat as adjunctive therapy in adult patients with focal epilepsy. The trial population will include patients with an appropriate severity level of disease to allow for the detection of anticonvulsant activity with darigabat. The key inclusion criteria include: (1) men and women 18 to 75 years of age with a diagnosis of epilepsy with focal onset as defined by the International League Against Epilepsy as focal aware, focal impaired awareness and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures for at least two years; (2) drug resistance, defined as lack of seizure control despite the use of at least two prior AEDs; (3) current treatment with at least one but no more than three AEDs and (4) a history of an average of four or more spontaneous and observable seizures per 28-day period for at least three months.
After the eight-week screening period, 150 eligible patients who have suffered at least eight focal onset seizures during the screening period will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following three arms: 25 mg BID of darigabat; 7.5 mg BID of darigabat or placebo BID. The two doses of darigabat have been selected based on the safety and tolerability data from previous Phase 1 trials, the receptor occupancy modeling based on PET characterization and the doses used in the Phase 2 proof-of-principle photoepilepsy trial.
Throughout the screening period and over the course of the trial, patients will use an electronic seizure diary to capture their seizure events, which will enable assessment of change in seizure frequency between baseline, as assessed during the screening period, and following treatment. Following the eight-week screening period, eligible patients will enter a 13-week treatment period, which includes (1) a two-week titration phase, which was designed with the knowledge from prior clinical trials that somnolence side effects of darigabat may be mitigated by titration, (2) an eight-week maintenance phase and (3) either a three-week taper period or enrollment into REALIZE OLE, a 57-week open-label extension trial. The three-week taper phase is designed to mitigate possible risks of rebound seizures from too-rapid withdrawal from darigabat.
The primary endpoint to evaluate the efficacy of darigabat will be the reduction in frequency of focal onset seizures during the maintenance phase versus baseline as compared to the placebo group. This will be calculated as Rratio=(T-B)/(T+B) ×100, where T represents the seizure frequency rate per week in the maintenance phase and B represents the seizure frequency rate per week in the baseline screening period. The Rratio is between -100 and 100, where negative values will indicate reduction in seizure rate and positive values indicate increase in seizure rate during treatment. Reduction in seizure frequency using Rratio has been used as the primary endpoint in prior registrational trials of drugs for adjunctive treatment of focal epilepsy. Key secondary efficacy endpoints will include responder rate, defined as the percent of patients who experience at least a 50% reduction in focal onset seizure frequency compared to baseline, and seizure frequency per week over the eight-week maintenance phase. Safety parameters will include assessment of withdrawal symptoms during the taper phase of the trial.
We initiated the REALIZE trial in the second half of 2020, with data expected in the second half of 2022. The totality of the activity and tolerability data that will be generated in REALIZE, the Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, and REALIZE OLE, the 57-week open-label extension trial, will guide further clinical development of darigabat in epilepsy. We also plan to conduct additional clinical pharmacology studies as appropriate.
Tavapadon
We are developing our most advanced product candidate, tavapadon, as both a monotherapy and adjunctive therapy to levodopa, or L-dopa, as a treatment for early- and late-stage Parkinson’s, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the death of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, respectively. Tavapadon was rationally designed as an orally bioavailable, once-daily partial agonist that selectively targets dopamine D1/D5 receptor subtypes with the goal of balancing meaningful motor control activity with a favorable tolerability profile. To our knowledge, tavapadon is the only D1/D5 receptor partial agonist currently in clinical development for Parkinson’s and the first oral D1/D5 receptor agonist to have achieved sustained motor control improvement in Phase 2 trials of Parkinson’s. Based on extensive clinical data generated to date, including from three Phase 2 trials, we initiated a registration-directed Phase 3 program beginning in January 2020, which includes two trials in early-stage Parkinson’s, known as TEMPO-1 and TEMPO-2, one trial in late-stage Parkinson’s, known as TEMPO-3, and an open-label extension trial, known as TEMPO-4. We expect initial data from our Phase 3 program to be available beginning in the first half of 2023.
Parkinson’s Disease Background
Parkinson’s is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that primarily results in progressive and debilitating motor symptoms, including decreased bodily movement, or hypokinesia, slowness of movement, or bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that drives motor function through a complex interaction between the striatum, the region of the brain responsible for motor control, the thalamus and the motor cortex. Patients with Parkinson’s lose dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to increasingly reduced levels of dopamine in the striatum, which is believed to drive Parkinsonian motor symptoms. Parkinson’s is progressive in nature, and the later stages of the disease are marked by progressively lower levels of native dopamine production as an increasing number of dopamine-producing neurons die. The disease typically advances over decades before ultimately causing conditions that can lead to death.
According to the Parkinson’s Foundation, approximately one million people in the United States and approximately 10 million people worldwide suffer from Parkinson’s. Parkinson’s typically develops between the ages of 55 and 65 years and affects approximately 1% of people 60 years of age or older. As the overall global population continues to age, we expect that Parkinson’s will afflict an increasing number of patients.
The clinical diagnosis for Parkinson’s is well established and is based on the evaluation of both motor and non-motor symptoms. At the time of initial diagnosis, patients usually have a variety of mild, seemingly unrelated symptoms that are collectively non-debilitating. The current standards of care and their shortcomings are well understood. Treatments for early-stage Parkinson’s include monoamine oxidase-B, or MAO-B, inhibitors, which reduce the rate of endogenous dopamine metabolism, D2/D3-preferring dopamine agonists, which replace lost dopamine tone, and L-dopa, which increases dopamine concentration. Although these initial treatments for Parkinson’s are widely used, each treatment class has limitations that force patients to compromise between tolerability and efficacy.
MAO-B inhibitors are generally well tolerated, but normally demonstrate only modest impact on motor control, limiting use of these drugs to patients with mild symptoms or as an adjunctive therapy. Within two years, approximately 65% of patients on MAO-B inhibitors add medication and approximately 35% of patients on MAO-B inhibitors discontinue use.
Approved D2/D3-preferring agonists are full agonists of the D2/D3 receptor subtypes that are associated with meaningful motor control benefit, but have a challenging side-effect profile, including daytime sedation, or somnolence, compromised impulse control and risk of psychotic symptoms including hallucinations. Within two years, approximately 40% of patients on D2/D3-preferring agonists add medication and approximately 25% of patients on D2/D3-preferring agonists discontinue use. D2/D3 receptor subtypes are widely distributed in multiple non-motor-related brain circuits where over-activation can drive unwanted side effects. For example, repeated activation of D3 receptor subtypes in the reward-related nucleus accumbens may underpin the dysregulation of impulse control. D2/D3-preferring full agonism may also be associated with overexcitation of dopamine receptors, which may lead to increased dyskinesias when used adjunctively with L-dopa. The side effects of D2/D3-preferring agonists can negatively impact quality of life and may outweigh the benefits of treatment, especially in a population of early-stage Parkinson’s patients that are otherwise highly functional.
As the disease progresses, patients’ treatment regimens increasingly incorporate the use of L-dopa as either monotherapy or in combination with D2/D3-preferring agonists or MAO-B inhibitors. L-dopa is available in a number of formulations, including combinations with carbidopa, which is meant to allow for the use of lower doses of L-dopa to reduce nausea and vomiting side effects. Initial treatment with L-dopa typically results in a period of symptomatic relief for patients because L-dopa therapy transiently increases dopamine levels and affords rapid improvement of motor symptoms. Patients are typically initiated on L-dopa doses of 100 mg administered three times per day.
However, due to its short half-life, L-dopa transiently floods neurons with dopamine, resulting in fluctuating periods of high and low dopamine levels. These large fluctuations can cause the neurons in the brain to alter their response over time. With extended dosing, patients who use L-dopa begin to experience fluctuations between periods of insufficient motor control associated with Parkinson’s, known as “off” time, and periods of “on” time when they are not bothered by Parkinsonian motor deficits, but can be plagued by therapy-induced involuntary movement, known as dyskinesias. After starting L-dopa therapy, approximately 40% of patients experience “off” time within three to five years and between 30% and 40% of patients experience dyskinesias within five years. As the disease progresses, patients generally need to increase their L-dopa dose and frequency to maintain motor

control. In the most advanced stages of disease, L-dopa doses can be as high as 2,000 mg total per day, requiring up to eight doses of L-dopa per day. This further exacerbates fluctuations and leads to more dyskinesias. The onset and intensity of L-dopa-induced dyskinesias are typically correlated with doses of at least 400 mg per day. The substantial and unpredictable swings between “off” time and dyskinesias can be attributed, in part, to the short half-life of L-dopa. In addition, high doses of L-dopa can be associated with psychosis, which may be further exacerbated by adjunctive use of D2/D3-preferring agonists. In order to delay the onset of such side effects, clinicians may delay recommending L-dopa until patients progress to later stages of Parkinson’s.
Our Solution—Tavapadon
Tavapadon is a selective partial agonist of the dopamine D1/D5 receptor subtypes expressed within the direct motor pathway that we are developing for the treatment of both early- and late-stage Parkinson’s. Key differentiating features of tavapadon include:
1.Mechanism of action—D1/D5 receptor subtype selectivity: Dopamine D1/D5 receptor subtypes differentially activate the direct motor pathway of the basal ganglia. Tavapadon is >400x more selective for D1/D5 receptor subtypes than for D2/D3 receptor subtypes. It therefore has the potential to drive motor benefit through targeting of the direct motor pathway while avoiding the side effects of D2/D3-preferring agonists, which target the indirect motor pathway. This mechanism of action as it applies to motor function is illustrated below: 
 


2.Receptor pharmacology—partial agonist: Tavapadon is an orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant small molecule with a 24-hour half-life that is designed to enable once-daily dosing by providing sustained motor benefit during the crucial morning wake period and throughout the day. Tavapadon is designed as a partial agonist of the D1/D5 receptor subtypes to (1) act as a surrogate for the natural dopamine production lost as a result of the death of dopamine-producing neurons and (2) activate the D1/D5 receptor subtypes at levels that maximize motor benefit while reducing the prolonged receptor overexcitation and desensitization caused by full agonists, which can lead to dyskinesias and exacerbation of “off” time resulting from L-dopa. Despite the recognized therapeutic potential of selective D1 activation, earlier attempts by others to develop D1/D5 receptor agonists failed due to limited oral bioavailability and brain penetration, short half-lives and other PK limitations. Tavapadon has been designed with a novel chemical structure that is intended to avoid the shortcomings of prior compounds. Tavapadon’s partial agonism is illustrated below. As compared to a full agonist, tavapadon avoids sustained full activation of D1/D5 receptor subtypes.
 



3.Clinical and preclinical evaluation: Tavapadon has been evaluated in 294 subjects in multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials, including in both the early- and late-stage Parkinson’s patient populations required for a broad Parkinson’s indication. Across all Phase 1b and Phase 2 trials completed to date, tavapadon has demonstrated motor control benefit with lower levels of somnolence and impulse control side effects than would be anticipated with D2/D3-preferring agonists. In addition, preclinical studies of tavapadon in a translationally relevant non-human primate model demonstrated robust and persistent activity and reduced incidence of dyskinesias. Tavapadon’s lack of abuse potential was also supported by a series of non-human primate studies.
 We believe the expected clinical profile of tavapadon has the potential to become a standard of care across the treatment spectrum for both early- and late-stage Parkinson’s patients.
High-functioning early-stage Parkinson’s patients have adequate motor control on monotherapy with D2/D3-preferring agonists, but the side effects of these therapies are often more debilitating than Parkinson’s symptoms. On the other hand, while MAO-B inhibitors have a favorable side effect profile, only a small percentage of early-stage Parkinson’s patients are well-controlled on this class of drug due to limited efficacy. We believe that tavapadon’s potential for motor benefit similar to D2/D3-preferring agonists with a lower likelihood of their commonly-occurring severe side effects (such as excessive somnolence, hypotension and impulsive behavior) could ultimately enable tavapadon to displace these agents among early-stage Parkinson’s patients.
For the more advanced Parkinson’s patient who is no longer adequately treated with D2/D3-preferring agonists, tavapadon’s potential motor control benefit may create a treatment option to address motor control symptoms before adding L-dopa to the regimen. Furthermore, we believe tavapadon could be a preferred adjunctive treatment with L-dopa due to its longer half-life, potentially improved tolerability profile and reduced incidence of dyskinesias.
Finally, for the late-stage Parkinson’s patient already experiencing “off” time while on L-dopa, tavapadon use as an adjunctive therapy with L-dopa may provide 24-hour coverage and delay the need for L-dopa dose escalation, thus increasing “on” time without troublesome dyskinesias.
We believe our registration-directed Phase 3 program for tavapadon has the potential to establish tavapadon as the cornerstone treatment across the spectrum of Parkinson’s disease therapy—the preferred choice for the newly diagnosed patient and the ideal adjunctive therapy as the disease progresses.

Clinical Trials
As part of an extensive clinical program, tavapadon has been evaluated across 11 prior clinical trials, including five Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers, three Phase 1/1b trials in patients with Parkinson's and three Phase 2 trials. A total of 294 subjects, including 113 healthy volunteers and 181 patients with Parkinson’s, have been exposed to tavapadon in completed trials.
Tavapadon has demonstrated activity in the treatment of motor symptoms, both as a monotherapy and as an adjunct to L-dopa. An open-label, multi-dose, Phase 1b trial of tavapadon demonstrated reduction in motor symptoms at the 15 mg dose, with a magnitude of effect comparable to results seen in the L-dopa arm of the trial and a duration consistent with tavapadon’s 24-hour half-life.
In a Phase 2 trial in early-stage Parkinson’s, tavapadon demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference from placebo of -4.8 points on the MDS-UPDRS Part III motor score at week 15 of the treatment period. Separation from placebo was observed as early as week three while still in the titration phase. Statistical significance (p=0.0407) for this endpoint was achieved despite the trial being terminated early when only 65% of the planned trial population had been enrolled and even though only 42% of the patients who reached the maintenance period had received the top dose of 15 mg. In addition, at week 15, 50% of patients treated with tavapadon reported being “much improved” or “very much improved” on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement, an important qualitative assessment of meaningful change in overall patient condition and well-being.
A Phase 2 trial in late-stage Parkinson’s was terminated by Pfizer based on the results of an interim analysis, which determined that the probability of meeting the efficacy criterion for the primary endpoint of improvement in “off” time reduction compared to placebo at week 10 was lower than a pre-specified efficacy hurdle. As explained in more detail herein, we believe the pre-specified efficacy hurdle was a significant threshold to overcome given the limited duration of the trial. Despite the early termination of this trial, tavapadon showed a 1.0 hour improvement versus placebo in “on” time without troublesome dyskinesias at week 10 with a sustained effect observed through week 15, which, while not statistically significant, we and our clinical advisors believe is clinically meaningful.
Across the 11 clinical trials completed to date, tavapadon has consistently demonstrated what we believe to be a favorable tolerability profile as well as a PK profile with a 24-hour terminal half-life. Commonly reported AEs leading to discontinuation of tavapadon across all the clinical trials were nausea, vomiting, dyskinesia, falling, fatigue and sleep disorder. The occurrence of nausea increased with tavapadon dose and was often related to the rate of titration, which is a well-known occurrence with most dopamine receptor agonists. We believe that these gastrointestinal effects may be mitigated by the slower titration method that we plan to use in our registration-directed Phase 3 program. Headache was the most commonly reported CNS-related event across all clinical trials. Other commonly reported CNS-related AEs included dizziness, somnolence and tremor. The majority of all observed AEs were mild to moderate in severity.
In addition, preclinical studies of tavapadon in the well-established MPTP non-human primate model of Parkinson’s demonstrated robust and persistent activity and reduced incidence of dyskinesias relative to L-dopa. Tavapadon’s lack of abuse potential was also supported in a series of non-human primate studies.
We believe the results observed in the Phase 2 trials in Parkinson’s, together with the tolerability profile demonstrated throughout the clinical program to date, support an encouraging benefit-risk profile and strong rationale for our registration-directed Phase 3 program in Parkinson’s as well as tavapadon’s potential commercial impact.

The table below provides an overview of all clinical trials completed to date for tavapadon.

 (2)Most relevant trials discussed in greater detail in the following section. 
 Our prior and future trials with tavapadon in Parkinson’s utilize three scales for patient selection: (1) either the Hoehn and Yahr scale or the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale; (2) the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, or MDS-UPDRS; and (3) the Hauser motor fluctuation patient diary. Two of these scales, MDS-UPDRS and the Hauser diary, are also used to measure therapeutic benefit.
The Hoehn and Yahr scale and modified Hoehn and Yahr scale are commonly accepted reference scales to measure disease progression in Parkinson’s, with stage one being the earliest and stage five being the most advanced. In clinical trials of tavapadon, the Hoehn and Yahr scale and the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale are used primarily for patient selection and enrollment.


Hoehn and Yahr scale | | Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale
1: | Unilateral involvement only usually with minimal or no functional disability | | 1.0: | Unilateral involvement only 
2: | Bilateral or midline involvement without impairment of balance | | 1.5: | Unilateral and axial involvement 
3: | Bilateral disease: mild to moderate disability with impaired postural reflexes; physically independent | | 2.0: | Bilateral involvement without impairment of balance 
4: | Severely disabling disease; still able to walk or stand unassisted | | 2.5: | Mild bilateral disease with recovery on pull test 
5: | Confinement to bed or wheelchair unless aided | | 3.0: | Mild to moderate bilateral disease; some postural instability; physically independent
 | | | 4.0: | Severe disability; still able to walk or stand unassisted 
 | | | 5.0: | Wheelchair bound or bedridden unless aided 

 


The MDS-UPDRS or its predecessor are the most widely used assessment for clinical evaluation of Parkinson’s, and, to our knowledge, based on a review of the FDA’s approved drugs database, Part III scores (alone or in combination with Part II) have been used in some way as the primary basis for evaluation and approval of the three D2/D3-preferring agonists and one MAO-B inhibitor that are currently FDA approved as monotherapies for the treatment of early Parkinson’s symptoms. The MDS-UPDRS utilizes a combination of physician and patient assessments. A negative change from baseline in total score represents an improvement in symptoms. A decrease of 3.25 points or greater on the Part III total score and a decrease of 4.9 points or greater on the Part II and III combined total score have been previously identified as clinically relevant changes on these measures. The four parts of the MDS-UPDRS are described below, along with the number of items evaluated in each part and the possible total score range:


MDS-UPDRSPart | Description | Numberof ItemsEvaluated | | TotalScoreRange
Part I | Non-motor aspects of experiences of daily living | | 13 | | 0 to 52 
Part II | Motor aspects of experiences of daily living | | 13 | | 0 to 52 
Part III | Motor examination | | 18 | | 0 to 132
Part IV | Motor complications | | 6 | | 0 to 24 

 
A cross-sectional study of over 3,000 patients with Parkinson’s identified the following mean MDS-UPDRS Part II and Part III scores based on Hoehn and Yahr stage:
   
Hoehn and Yahr Stage | Mean MDS-UPDRS Part II Score | Mean MDS-UPDRS Part III Score
Stage One | 6.5 | 14.4 
Stage Two | 11.2 | 28.8 
Stage Three | 17.5 | 40.5 

 
The Hauser diary assesses patient-defined motor function and provides a measure of change in “off” time and “on” time. The Hauser diary asks patients to rate their daily mobility for each 30-minute period over 24 hours, and to record their status for the majority of the period in one of five categories: “on” time without dyskinesias, “on” time with non-troublesome dyskinesias, “on” time with troublesome dyskinesias, “off” time or asleep. To our knowledge, improvements in “off” and “on” time have been used as the primary evaluation of benefit for all treatments that have been approved by the FDA as adjunctive therapy to L-dopa in patients with advanced Parkinson’s experiencing motor fluctuations.
Selected Trials in Parkinson’s Disease
Phase 1b Multiple Ascending Dose Trial
In March 2016, Pfizer completed Trial B7601005, a two-period, open-label, dose escalation Phase 1b trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tavapadon in Parkinson’s patients, with a secondary objective of characterizing the PK of tavapadon when used in combination with L-dopa and exploring the effect of tavapadon on motor performance and dyskinesia.
The trial enrolled 50 patients with stage one to three Parkinson’s as measured on the Hoehn and Yahr scale and a documented history of experiencing “off” time with their current L-dopa dose. Patients were randomized into four cohorts to receive three different target doses of tavapadon. One cohort received a target dose of 5 mg once-daily, or QD, one cohort received a target dose of 25 mg QD and two separate cohorts received target doses of 15 mg QD, with one of the two cohorts including only patients with Parkinson’s with documented L-dopa-induced dyskinesias and using a similar but more flexible up-titration schedule.
In Period 1 of the trial, 50 patients were treated with a single individualized dose of L-dopa, representing approximately one-third of each patient’s normal total daily L-dopa equivalent dose, to confirm L-dopa responsiveness. L-dopa responsiveness was evaluated after an overnight washout of the medication. A typical L-dopa regimen includes at least three doses per day, so this approach was taken to standardize the trial while also

administering a test dose of L-dopa that was equivalent to or greater than a typical L-dopa dose for each patient. In Period 2 of the trial, 45 patients were administered increasing doses of tavapadon up to the target dose of their respective cohorts. Target tavapadon doses were attained using titration schemes over an 11-day period. Tavapadon was added to the regimen while L-dopa therapy was simultaneously tapered down with the intent to withdraw L-dopa entirely over two weeks. Once the target tavapadon daily dose of 5 mg, 15 mg or 25 mg for each cohort was reached, the respective target dose levels were maintained for at least 10 days. L-dopa use was permitted as a rescue treatment throughout the trial.
The objectives of the trial were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of tavapadon in patients with Parkinson’s, to characterize the PK of L-dopa following a single dose and the PK of tavapadon following multiple doses and to explore the effect of tavapadon on motor performance and dyskinesia. Exploratory objectives included evaluating changes in MDS-UPDRS Part III motor scores before and after treatment, both acutely and after multiple doses of tavapadon without the concurrent use of L-dopa. L-dopa was withdrawn overnight before evaluation of MDS-UPDRS Part III motor scores on days 7, 13 and 22 in Period 2.
As shown below, on day 22, the last day of Period 2, administration of tavapadon in one of the 15 mg cohorts of 11 patients demonstrated a sustained MDS-UPDRS Part III motor score benefit for up to 12 hours. The magnitude of motor benefit was comparable to what had been observed following a single administration of L-dopa in Period 1, the previously discussed L-dopa responsiveness test, in this cohort. A reduction of about 10 points from baseline was observed at time zero, just before dosing, on day 22, demonstrating the sustained effect of tavapadon 24 hours after the previous dose. We believe this observation of sustained benefit supports the potential for once-daily dosing of tavapadon. Patients in the 5 mg and 25 mg cohorts also observed sustained and what we believe to be clinically relevant motor benefit over eight hours, albeit with less magnitude than the 15 mg cohort. In the 15 mg cohort with dyskinetic patients, only three of the six patients dosed with tavapadon completed the trial, resulting in too small of a dataset to draw meaningful conclusions.
 Change in MDS-UPDRS Part III in Cohort 4
 on Day 1 (L-Dopa Responsiveness Test) and Day 22 (Tavapadon 15 mg QD)
   

Based on the results of this trial, multiple ascending doses of tavapadon of up to 25 mg were considered to be generally well tolerated. A total of 11 patients, including four of 17 patients in the two 15 mg cohorts and seven of 19 patients in the 25 mg cohort, discontinued tavapadon due to AEs. Headache (four occurrences) and abnormal dreams (two occurrences) were the most common AEs leading to discontinuation. Headache, nausea, abnormal

dreams, dizziness and vomiting were the most common AEs across all cohorts, the majority of which were mild to moderate in severity, with six severe adverse events and one SAE observed. One patient in the 25 mg cohort experienced an SAE of palpitations, which occurred at the 1 mg titration dose and was determined by the investigator as not related to treatment. The majority of AEs occurred during the titration period, with the gastrointestinal AEs appearing to be dose related. Most AEs appeared to be related to the pace and increment of up-titration rather than maximum exposure to tavapadon.
Phase 2 Trial in Early-Stage Parkinson’s
In January 2018, Pfizer concluded Trial B7601011, a 15-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, flexible dose Phase 2 trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of tavapadon in patients with early-stage Parkinson’s. As discussed below, Pfizer terminated this early-stage Parkinson’s trial early based on the results from the Phase 2 late-stage Parkinson’s trial.
The trial enrolled 57 early-stage Parkinson’s patients with stage one to three Parkinson’s as measured on the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Prior to early termination of the trial by Pfizer, 88 patients had been planned to be enrolled in the trial. Patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis into two arms to receive 15 weeks of treatment with tavapadon or placebo. The 15-week treatment period included nine weeks of dose titration and optimization followed by six weeks of stable dosing at up to 15 mg of tavapadon. The primary endpoint was the change in MDS-UPDRS Part III motor score from baseline at week 15. Exploratory endpoints included the Patient Global Impression of Improvement, or the PGI-I, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, or the ESS.
As part of the trial design, there was a pre-determined decision to terminate the trial early if the concurrent Phase 2 trial in late-stage Parkinson’s (Trial B7601003) did not meet a strategic pre-set threshold for efficacy at the interim analysis. As described below, the late-stage Parkinson’s trial was terminated early, which resulted in the early termination of this trial as well. At the time of the trial termination, only 11 of 26 patients that reached the six-week maintenance period were on the 15 mg target dose.
This trial enrolled treatment-naïve Parkinson’s patients that had no prior exposure to Parkinson’s medications as well as Parkinson’s patients with prior or current use of MAO-B inhibitors, amantadine and anticholinergics. Concurrent use of these medications was permitted during the trial as long as dosing had been stable for at least 42 days prior to randomization. Patients with incidental prior exposure to L-dopa or a dopamine agonist for less than a total of 28 days were also permitted, as long as such exposure had not occurred within seven days of randomization. In total, 57 patients were randomized, with 29 patients in the active arm and 28 patients in the placebo arm. Due to the early termination of the trial, only 65% of target enrollment was reached and 25 active patients and 22 placebo patients completed the trial. Despite the reduced sample size of patients completing the trial, the trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in MDS-UPDRS Part III motor scores from baseline at week 15 for patients on tavapadon as compared to placebo. The trial originally planned to enroll 88 patients to power for the conventional threshold for statistical significance of p=0.05, based on a predicted treatment effect of at least -3.6 points on the primary endpoint of change in MDS-UPDRS Part III motor score from baseline at week 15. Since the actual observed treatment effect of -4.8 points was in excess of the expected treatment effect of -3.6 points used to power the trial, fewer than expected patients were required for sufficient power to demonstrate statistical significance. While the trial was terminated early, resulting in fewer patients being enrolled into and dosed in the trial than originally expected, such early termination of recruitment did not affect the validity of the trial or the results achieved as they relate to the patients that actually completed the dosing regimen as originally planned. Additionally, the early termination of the trial did not result in the dosed patients being treated for a shorter duration than planned or in a different manner than was contemplated by the protocol. Furthermore, the early termination of the trial did not introduce selection or allocation bias with respect to randomization. The early termination of recruitment did not alter the enforced inclusion or exclusion criteria that defined the target patient population, the 1:1 balanced and double-blind randomization or assignment of subjects to treatment arms, nor the treatment duration contemplated by the original trial design. Although the overall number of patients dosed decreased as a result of early termination, these patients studied were representative of the target population of early-stage Parkinson’s patients. In the dosed trial population, the variance of the results did not exceed what was expected in the original powering assumptions for the trial, nor what was consistently observed among prior early-stage Parkinson’s trials.
The results of the trial on the full dataset are summarized below.
•As illustrated below, the mean change from baseline at week 15 in the MDS-UPDRS Part III motor score was -9.0 for tavapadon across all dose levels administered in the maintenance phase and -4.3 for placebo, 


with a least squares mean improvement over placebo of -4.8 in favor of the tavapadon group (p=0.0407). These changes are well above the 3.25-point improvement that is recognized as clinically meaningful on the MDS-UPDRS Part III motor score. Mean baseline MDS-UPDRS III motor scores were 24.3 and 25.8 for the tavapadon and placebo groups, respectively.

Change in MDS-UPDRS Part III
    

* Indicates two-sided p-value of less than or equal to 0.1.
 
•At week 15, 50% of patients treated with tavapadon reported being “much improved” or “very much improved” on the PGI-I, compared with 25% in the placebo group (p=.0393). The PGI-I is a patient-reported outcome and an important qualitative assessment of meaningful change in overall patient condition and well-being.
 •At weeks nine and 15, across all dose levels, tavapadon demonstrated a 1.0 and 1.1 point improvement, respectively, relative to placebo on the MDS-UPDRS Part II total score, which measures motor aspects of experiences of daily living. Because sample sizes were small and the trial was not powered to show significance on this endpoint, these changes were not statistically significant. Since each item evaluated by the MDS-UPDRS II total score measures daily function, we believe that any measurable improvements over placebo would be considered clinically relevant.
 •At weeks nine and 15, there was no statistically significant difference between the tavapadon and placebo groups in somnolence as measured by the ESS. Somnolence is a known side effect of D2/D3-preferring agonists.
 •Tavapadon demonstrated the potential for a favorable tolerability profile, with the majority of AEs reported as mild or moderate and one SAE of suicidal ideation observed, which was considered related to the investigational product by the investigator but not related by the sponsor, and which was resolved on the same day. The most frequently reported AEs in patients treated with tavapadon were nausea, headache, dry mouth, tremor and fatigue. Treatment compliance was high in both the tavapadon and placebo groups, with 86% of patients who received tavapadon completing the trial.
 The trial results described above are based on nine weeks of dose titration and optimization and only six weeks of stable dosing. Past Parkinson’s trials for other compounds have indicated that the results observed in placebo subjects on measures such as the MDS-UPDRS scale may peak between eight and 18 weeks of treatment and then deteriorate over a longer timeframe, resulting in a greater difference between active treatment and placebo at six months. We believe a longer treatment duration of six months could result in further improved results compared to placebo.

Phase 2 Trial Late-Stage Parkinson’s
In November 2017, Pfizer concluded Trial B7601003, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging Phase 2 trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of tavapadon as an adjunct therapy for patients on L-dopa experiencing motor fluctuations due to Parkinson’s.
The trial was designed to enroll approximately 198 patients with late-stage Parkinson’s on stable doses of at least 400 mg of L-dopa four times per day and experiencing at least 2.5 hours of “off” time per day for three consecutive days based on the Hauser diaries collected during screening. After the screening period, patients who met the screening criteria were randomized to four treatment groups of tavapadon or placebo as an add-on therapy to L-dopa: 15 mg QD, 7 mg QD, 3 mg QD, 1 mg QD or placebo. The trial duration was approximately 25 weeks, including a 45-day screening period, a 15-week double-blind treatment period and an approximately 28-day follow-up period. The treatment period was comprised of up to three weeks of dose titration, two weeks of dose optimization and Period A, five weeks of maintenance, followed by Period B, either five additional weeks of maintenance with concurrent down-titration of L-dopa dosing or five additional weeks of maintenance with the current L-dopa regimen kept stable. The design of the trial is summarized below:

   

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in daily hours of “off” time at the end of Period A (week 10), based on patient-reported Hauser diaries. Key secondary and exploratory endpoints included change in “on” time without troublesome dyskinesias, the PGI-I, the ESS and performance on MDS-UPDRS Parts I-IV motor scores.
As part of the initial trial protocol, Pfizer established a pre-defined early termination criterion based on the likelihood of achieving a pre-specified efficacy hurdle. We believe this efficacy hurdle was set disproportionately high given the treatment duration of the trial. Specifically, an interim analysis was conducted when 108 patients of the targeted 198 patients were enrolled to determine if there was a less than 10% predictive probability of demonstrating an absolute placebo-adjusted reduction in “off” time of 1.5 hours or more at week 10. The interim analysis revealed that this pre-defined efficacy hurdle was not met by any of the doses of tavapadon evaluated in this trial. At the time of the interim analysis, approximately 50 patients had completed treatment through week 10 of the trial. Based on these interim results, Pfizer made a decision to terminate both this trial as well as the concurrent Phase 2 early-stage Parkinson’s trial described above (Trial B7601011).
We believe the pre-defined efficacy criterion was a significant hurdle to meet given the limited duration of the trial, where patients spent the first three weeks of treatment titrating up to the maximum 15 mg target dose of tavapadon, if tolerated, and only seven weeks of treatment at the maintenance dose. Based on historical data from past Parkinson’s clinical development programs, we believe that a minimum of six months of treatment, inclusive of dose titration to a target maintenance dose, would be necessary to see an absolute placebo-adjusted reduction in “off” time of 1.5 hours or more.
In the final analysis of the primary endpoint, the placebo-adjusted reduction from baseline to week 10 in average daily “off” time was 0.63 hours for the tavapadon 15 mg QD group (n=41), which, although not statistically significant, we believe to be clinically relevant. For example, the approval of Nourianz (istradefylline) as adjunctive treatment with L-dopa in Parkinson’s was based on placebo-adjusted improvements in “off” time of less than one hour. Furthermore, the final analysis also showed a clinically meaningful one-hour improvement in “on” time without troublesome dyskinesias at week 10 for the tavapadon 15 mg QD group as compared to placebo. For doses of tavapadon below 15 mg, the sample sizes were too small to draw meaningful conclusions (nine patients in the 3 mg QD group, nine patients in the 7 mg QD group and seven patients in the 1 mg QD group).

Placebo-Adjusted Change in “On” Time without Troublesome Dyskinesias
   

Although the endpoints in this trial did not achieve statistical significance, we believe that if the trial had been completed with the full sample size, there would have been a reasonable possibility of observing a treatment effect and statistical separation from placebo on both the “off” time and “on” time without troublesome dyskinesias endpoints.
A further pre-specified analysis of secondary endpoints was also completed for the 21 patients who completed treatment through week 15 of the trial, while keeping their L-dopa dose unchanged. This analysis showed a placebo-adjusted reduction from baseline in average daily “off” time of 3.52 hours and an increase in average daily “on” time without troublesome dyskinesias of 2.31 hours. The increases in treatment effect from week 10 to week 15 were primarily driven by a worsening of motor fluctuations in the placebo arm, with tavapadon activity remaining comparable to what was observed at week 10. Although based on only 21 patients (14 patients in the tavapadon 15 mg group and seven patients in the placebo group), which represented approximately half of the patients available at week 10, the observed durability of the treatment effect through week 15 strengthens our belief that the motor control improvements observed with tavapadon are reliable and support our decision to proceed to a registration-directed Phase 3 trial.
Historically, the FDA considered the “off” time endpoint to be an appropriate assessment of therapeutic benefit in patients with late-stage Parkinson’s. However, the FDA’s view has evolved, and the agency now considers the change from baseline in average daily “on” time without troublesome dyskinesias to be the most appropriate assessment of therapeutic benefit for this patient population. Based on the above data, we plan to utilize the change from baseline in “on” time without troublesome dyskinesias as the primary endpoint in our Phase 3 trial of tavapadon as an adjunct to L-dopa in late-stage Parkinson’s patients.

 Safety and Tolerability Data
To date, 294 subjects have received at least one dose of tavapadon across 11 clinical trials, including healthy volunteers in five Phase 1 trials and patients with Parkinson’s in three Phase 1/1b trials and three Phase 2 trials. Across these trials, tavapadon was generally well tolerated up to a titrated dose of 15 mg QD in patients with Parkinson's. A dose-dependent increase in the frequency of nausea and headache was observed across all trials. Most AEs were self-limited and mild to moderate in severity, with nausea, vomiting, dyskinesia, fall, fatigue, sleep disorder and tremors being common AEs leading to discontinuation of tavapadon.
As expected for a dopaminergic agent, there was a marked difference in tolerability in healthy volunteers who do not have a preexisting dopamine deficit when compared to Parkinson’s patients. For example, a single dose of 9 mg in our Phase 1b SAD trial was generally well tolerated in Parkinson’s patients, while a single dose of 1.5 mg in our Phase 1 SAD trial was associated with a high rate of nausea and vomiting in healthy volunteers. This difference is also seen with other dopaminergic drugs such as L-dopa and D2/D3-preferring agonists. These agents are titrated when used as Parkinson’s treatments to improve tolerability to gastrointestinal and other side effects. The speed of titration may also play a role in the tolerability of side effects such as nausea and vomiting. We will titrate more slowly in our ongoing registration-directed Phase 3 program, which we believe will help mitigate such side effects.
There were no observations of notable differences in laboratory results, parameters or suicidality assessments between tavapadon and placebo. An analysis of multi-dose cohorts in Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers and Parkinson’s patients, including patients who were treated at doses of up to 25 mg QD of tavapadon, did not suggest that tavapadon prolongs the QTc interval, an ECG measurement used to assess the risk of potential cardiac arrhythmias, corrected for heart rate by Fridericia’s formula. Transient prolongation of group mean QTc interval of

up to 11 milliseconds was observed in single dose trials in healthy volunteers and in Parkinson’s patients. However, QTc interval prolongation was not observed in any multi-dose trials. Based on our end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA where we presented single-dose ECG, multiple-dose ECG and a model-based analysis of Phase 1 data, we plan to collect time- matched PK and ECG measures in a subset of patients as a sub-study in our ongoing Phase 3 fixed-dose early-stage Parkinson’s trial. A stand-alone thorough QT study was not required by the FDA and is not planned.
Clinical trials of longer treatment duration of up to 15 weeks suggest a modest tavapadon dose-related decrease from baseline in systolic and/or diastolic parameters, with some cases of asymptomatic hypotension. Postural hypotension is a common finding in the population of Parkinson’s patients. The occurrence of symptomatic and acute symptomatic orthostatic hypotension with use of L-dopa and D2/D3-preferring agonists is a well-documented risk. Based on preclinical and clinical data observed to date and on tavapadon’s partial agonism pharmacology, we believe the risk of hypotension is reduced with tavapadon relative to full dopamine agonists.

 Ongoing Clinical Trials
Based on the substantial clinical data generated to date with tavapadon, we initiated our registration-directed Phase 3 program beginning in January 2020. This program includes two trials in early-stage Parkinson’s, known as TEMPO-1 and TEMPO-2, one trial in late-stage Parkinson’s, known as TEMPO-3, and an open-label extension trial, known as TEMPO-4. Informed by the results of the Phase 2 trials in early- and late-stage Parkinson’s, our Phase 3 program has been designed to further characterize and evaluate tavapadon’s risk-benefit profile in the context of existing standards of care for Parkinson’s patients. Specifically, these trials will evaluate the utility of tavapadon across the disease spectrum of Parkinson’s, from early-stage patients to late-stage patients experiencing dyskinesias and “off” time on L-dopa. Our Phase 3 program will include additional standard clinical pharmacology studies to support a potential future new drug application, or NDA, submission and product labeling. We had an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in August 2019, during which we obtained feedback on our registration-directed Phase 3 program. Based on this feedback, we believe that we have an understanding of all of the essential elements required for a potential NDA submission for tavapadon.
Phase 3 Early-Stage Parkinson’s Trials
As part of our registration-directed Phase 3 program, we are conducting two trials in early-stage Parkinson’s patients. The diagram below summarizes the design of the two trials:
   


TEMPO-1: Phase 3 Fixed-Dose Early-Stage Parkinson’s Trial
Based on historical registrational fixed-dose trials of approved Parkinson’s treatments, we designed TEMPO-1, a Phase 3 trial as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose, 27-week trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of tavapadon in early-stage Parkinson’s patients. We expect to enroll 522 patients with 1:1:1 randomization between tavapadon 5 mg QD, tavapadon 15 mg QD and placebo. We incorporated a preset mandatory dose titration schedule across the first six weeks of treatment in an attempt to minimize patient discontinuations. Key inclusion criteria include patients with modified Hoehn and Yahr stage one to two Parkinson’s with baseline MDS-UPDRS Part III motor score of 10 or greater and Part II score of two or greater. No concomitant Parkinson’s medications are allowed, except for use of MAO-B inhibitors if treatment was initiated at least 90 days before entering the trial and the dosage will remain stable for the duration of the trial.
 The primary endpoint for both our fixed-dose early-stage Parkinson’s trial and our flexible-dose early-stage Parkinson’s trial discussed below will be the change from baseline of the combined MDS-UPDRS Parts II and III scores. There is a long history of using the MDS-UPDRS Part III score, either individually or in combination with Part II score, as the primary endpoint in registrational Parkinson’s trials. To our knowledge, Part III scores have been used alone or in combination with Part II scores as the primary basis of approval for the three D2/D3- preferring agonists and one MAO-B inhibitor that are currently FDA approved as monotherapies for the treatment of early Parkinson’s symptoms. During our end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, the FDA stated that they believe that the MDS-UPDRS Part II score without Part III is a more appropriate primary endpoint in clinical trials for early-stage Parkinson’s patients, as all score changes in activities rated in Part II reflect a clinically relevant change in patients. The FDA explained that its interpretation of the primary endpoint results in our early-stage Phase 3 Parkinson’s trials would depend on a detailed analysis of the results and of the respective contributions of Parts II and III to the final trial results. The FDA also indicated that a determination as to whether the trials contribute substantial evidence of effectiveness would be a review issue at the time of the submission of the NDA.
Accordingly, the target enrollment being utilized for our Phase 3 trials in early-stage Parkinson’s is powered, based on results from the Phase 2 early-stage Parkinson’s trial, to provide 90% confidence of detecting a statistically significant placebo-adjusted improvement from baseline of four points or greater in the Part II and III combined score and a statistically significant placebo-adjusted change from baseline of one point or greater in the Part II score alone. Since each item evaluated by the MDS-UPDRS Part II total score measures daily function, we believe that any measurable improvements over placebo would be considered clinically relevant. Patients without any meaningful functional deficit at baseline, represented by an MDS-UPDRS Part II score of zero or one, who are thus not able to show meaningful improvement on their Part II score with treatment, will be excluded from the trials. We also believe the extended 27-week period of treatment will increase the probability of a robust difference from placebo on both the primary endpoint of Part II and III combined scores and the individual Part II score.
Key secondary endpoints are the change from baseline in the MDS-UPDRS Part II score and a responder analysis on Patient Global Impression of Change, a patient-reported assessment of the overall benefit of treatment (referred to as the PGI-I in prior tavapadon trials). Additional exploratory endpoints include quality of life measures as well as safety measures such as the ESS and Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson’s. We have designed the trial with these endpoints to demonstrate the impact of tavapadon on motor control and activities of daily living, as well as its potentially differentiated side effect profile with respect to somnolence and impulse control. We initiated this trial in January 2020. In response to the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we paused patient screening and enrollment of our Parkinson’s trials in March 2020, and we remain particularly vigilant about patient safety given the elderly nature of this population. We resumed the program and re-initiated dosing in the second half of 2020 and we expect data from this trial in the second half of 2023.
TEMPO-2: Phase 3 Flexible-Dose Early-Stage Parkinson’s Trial
TEMPO-2, our second Phase 3 trial is designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, flexible-dose, 27-week trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of tavapadon in patients with early-stage Parkinson’s. We plan to enroll 296 patients with 1:1 randomization between tavapadon, which will be flexibly titrated up to between 5 mg QD and 15 mg QD, and placebo. Following a fixed titration scheme to the 5 mg QD dose level, each patient’s dose will be further increased to a target dose of 15 mg QD unless prevented by tolerability. Patients unable to achieve or tolerate 15 mg QD or 10 mg QD may remain at 10 mg QD or 5 mg QD, respectively, for the remainder of the treatment phase. Key inclusion criteria include patients with modified Hoehn and Yahr stage one to two Parkinson’s with baseline MDS-UPDRS Part III motor score of 10 or greater and Part II

motor score of two or greater. No concomitant Parkinson’s medications are allowed except for MAO-B inhibitors if use was initiated at least 90 days before entering the trial and the dosage will remain stable for the duration of the trial.
As mentioned above, the primary endpoint is the change from baseline of combined MDS-UPDRS Parts II and III scores. Similar to the fixed-dose early-stage Parkinson’s Phase 3 trial, the primary endpoint will be supported by secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints as well as safety measures. The flexible dose design of this trial allows for more efficient powering that requires only two arms instead of three arms. The trial is powered with 90% confidence to detect a statistically significant difference of four points or more from placebo on the primary endpoint and a difference of one point or more from placebo on the Part II score alone. We initiated this trial in January 2020. In response to the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we paused patient screening and enrollment of our Parkinson’s trials in March 2020 and we remain particularly vigilant about patient safety given the elderly nature of this population. We resumed the program and re-initiated dosing in the second half of 2020 and we expect data from this trial in the second half of 2023.
 TEMPO-3: Phase 3 Flexible-Dose Late-Stage Parkinson’s Trial
TEMPO-3, our third Phase 3 trial is designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, flexible-dose, 27-week trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of tavapadon as an adjunct therapy in patients with late-stage Parkinson’s who are treated with L-dopa and experience motor fluctuations. We expect to enroll 368 patients with 1:1 randomization between tavapadon flexibly dosed up to between 5 and 15 mg QD and placebo. Following a fixed titration scheme to the 5 mg QD dose level, each patient’s dose will be further increased to a target dose of 15 mg QD unless prevented by tolerability. Patients unable to achieve or tolerate 15 mg or 10 mg QD may remain at 10 mg or 5 mg QD, respectively, for the remainder of the treatment period. Key inclusion criteria include patients with modified Hoehn and Yahr stage two to three Parkinson’s who maintain some level of responsiveness to L-dopa and are experiencing at least 2.5 hours of “off” time per day for two consecutive days at baseline.
The diagram below summarizes the design of this trial:
   

The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in total “on” time without troublesome dyskinesias. Based on the learnings from the Phase 2 trial in late-stage Parkinson’s, we have designed this trial with the intention of rectifying key design components that may have contributed to the inability to achieve Pfizer’s pre-specified efficacy hurdle for continuing the tavapadon program. For example, to minimize gastrointestinal and other side effects and patient discontinuations, the protocol for this trial allows for 14 weeks of gradual titration and adjustment, rather than the three weeks allowed in the Phase 2 trial. This titration schedule is followed by 13 weeks at maximal dosing, as opposed to the seven weeks in the Phase 2 trial, to fully explore tavapadon’s potential efficacy in these patients. The FDA has publicly stated that the primary endpoint of “on” time without troublesome dyskinesias is the most clinically relevant regulatory endpoint to assess therapeutic benefit in this patient population. The trial is powered to demonstrate a one-hour improvement over placebo in the primary endpoint with 90% confidence. An interim analysis by an independent Interim Analysis Review Committee is planned for when 67% of target enrollment is achieved to assess the adequacy of the overall sample size relative to achieving trial objectives

and to allow for potential sample size adjustment (up to a pre-specified maximum of 528 patients) if needed. We initiated this trial in the second half of 2020, with data expected in the first half of 2023.
TEMPO-4: Open-Label Extension Trial
Patients who complete any of the three Phase 3 trials will have the option to be rolled into TEMPO-4, a 58-week open-label extension trial, which will also be open to patients who did not participate in any of the Phase 3 trials. This trial is designed to provide sufficient safety data to support potential registration, including enough patients with completed six-month and 12-month treatment durations to meet the requirements for long-term safety evaluation of chronic use products at the time of an NDA submission. Based on our enrollment estimates for the Phase 3 program and the safety database required to support an NDA filing, we expect the open-label extension trial will remain ongoing at the time of NDA submission. In addition to supporting the NDA package, this open-label extension trial will allow us to collect additional long-term data on efficacy and side-effect profile to further inform how physicians might use tavapadon in the treatment paradigm.
CVL-871
CVL-871 is a selective partial agonist of the dopamine D1/D5 receptor subtypes specifically designed to achieve a modest level of partial agonism, which we believe may be useful in modulating the complex neural networks that govern cognition, motivation and behavior. Dopamine acting on D1/D5 receptor subtypes in the cortex and midbrain plays a key role in the finely-tuned and dynamic neural network that modulates cognitive function, reward-processing and decision-making. In patients with Parkinson’s, we have observed that improving motor symptoms requires higher levels of partial agonism to offset the large losses in dopaminergic neurons in the motor cortex. In contrast, dementia patients require a more finely-tuned modulation of the neural networks that govern cognition, motivation and behavior to normalize the dynamic range. As such, we have designed CVL-871 to have a lower level of partial agonism than tavapadon. The hypothesis for using D1/D5 receptor subtype partial agonism to treat dementia-related apathy is informed by clinical trials of other compounds where increases in dopamine activity resulted in a statistically significant improvement on apathy scales. We believe CVL-871 may possess an optimal profile to target this new indication due to the degree to which it activates relevant dopamine circuits within the brain and its favorable clinical tolerability profile observed to date. We are currently conducting an exploratory Phase 2a dose-ranging trial in dementia-related apathy with data expected in the first half of 2023.
Apathy Background
Apathy is among the most common neuropsychiatric co-morbidities associated with dementia, afflicting almost 50% of the over 50 million dementia patients globally. Apathy represents a constellation of symptoms, such as social disengagement, diminished initiative and interest and loss of emotion, that result in impaired decision making, lack of empathy, affection or concern, loss of interest in personal wellbeing, relationships or external issues, inability to initiate and maintain normal activities, and interference with complex and basic daily functions, including motivation to eat, dress, maintain personal hygiene, and take medications. The presence of apathy has been shown to be related to decreased quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, along with early institutionalization and greater resource utilization resulting from increased caregiver burden. In addition, apathy is associated with an increased risk developing dementia and disease progression. Therefore, the management of apathy is an important component in caring for patients with dementia.
While clinicians, patients and caregivers have been challenged by this symptom, there are no currently approved therapies for dementia-related apathy. The FDA has demonstrated interest in development of a therapy for this indication and we are interacting with the agency to define the regulatory requirements and clinical development plan to achieve this novel indication. Pharmacologic treatment of patients is comprised primarily of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, SSRIs and psychostimulants such as methylphenidate. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil and rivastigmine, which are typically prescribed for Alzheimer’s patients to improve cognition, have shown no proven effects on apathy in clinical trials. Though patients are sometimes prescribed SSRIs and antidepressants, use of these medications for apathy treatment in dementia is not supported by clinical evidence and the latest evidence suggests they may actually contribute to worsening symptoms.
Conscious goal-directed behavior is mediated by the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. D1 receptors in non-motor brain regions are believed to modulate cognition, reward and decision-making. The hypothesis for using D1/D5 receptor subtype agonism in this indication is informed by clinical trials of other dopamine-potentiating

compounds where increases in dopamine activity resulted in a statistically significant improvement on apathy scales. For example, in a 60-patient clinical trial evaluating methylphenidate, a stimulant associated with increased dopamine levels, neuropsychiatric inventory apathy scores were improved by 1.8 points versus placebo at week six (p=0.002). These results imply a 63% reduction from the baseline score for methylphenidate versus a 33% reduction for placebo. The principal investigator of this trial indicated that these effects appear large enough to be of significance to clinical practice. Based on additional discussions with clinicians, we believe an improvement of this magnitude would be clinically meaningful. Methylphenidate is a Schedule II controlled substance, stimulant medication used for the treatment of ADHD that has well-established side effects, including serious impacts on cardiovascular function, appetite and sleep.
Our Solution—CVL-871
CVL-871 is a selective partial agonist of the dopamine D1/D5 receptor subtypes that we are developing for the treatment of dementia-related apathy. Key differentiating features of CVL-871 include:
1.Mechanism of action—D1/D5 receptor subtype selectivity: CVL-871 has been designed to selectively target dopamine D1/D5 receptor subtypes in order to treat motivational impairment without driving the somnolent, hallucinatory or impulse control effects mechanistically associated with the activation of D2/D3 receptor subtypes.
 2.Receptor pharmacology—partial agonist: CVL-871 is an orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant small molecule with a 24-hour half-life. Both CVL-871 and tavapadon are designed as partial agonists to the D1/D5 receptors to a lesser extent than the natural ligand dopamine. CVL-871 has a reduced level of activation compared to tavapadon, which we believe facilitates optimal activation of D1/D5 receptor subtypes in brain regions that control motivation and reward. These neural networks require more finely-tuned modulation to normalize the dynamic range, and the reduced partial agonism of CVL-871 is designed to restore, but not exceed, the optimal level of stimulation that is thought to be most associated with cognition and apathy. CVL-871’s reduced partial agonism is illustrated below, as compared to tavapadon and a full agonist.
    

3.Clinical and preclinical evaluation: CVL-871 has been tested in a total of 58 subjects, including healthy volunteers in a Phase 1 single and MAD trial and Parkinson’s patients in a seven-day Phase 1 trial. These trials have demonstrated evidence of CNS activity and provided clinical data that support the targeted lower partial agonism of CVL-871 relative to tavapadon. Preclinical studies showed activity in models of motor function as well as cortical function linked to increased D1 activation. Preclinical safety and toxicology studies of up to 26 weeks in duration have been completed and data to date supports the dosing duration expected in our planned Phase 2 trial.


We believe CVL-871 could possess the optimal profile amongst D1/D5 receptor agonists to target hypothesized dopaminergic deficits in D1-mediated neural circuits related to motivation and reward processing, and clinical research suggests increased dopamine receptor activation may have a role in the treatment of dementia-related apathy.
 Clinical Trials
Two Phase 1 trials of CVL-871 have been completed in a total of 58 subjects, including both healthy volunteers and Parkinson’s patients. In these trials, CVL-871 was observed to be generally well tolerated. Evidence of moderate improvement in motor symptoms, a measure of biological activity, was also observed, along with a PK profile that supports the potential for once-daily dosing. Consistent with CVL-871’s lower partial agonism, these studies showed a difference compared to tavapadon, including improved tolerability in healthy volunteers and a more modest magnitude of motor benefit in patients with Parkinson’s. Based on these findings, we are conducting an exploratory Phase 2a trial of CVL-871 in dementia-related apathy with data expected in the first half of 2023.
Ongoing Exploratory Phase 2a Clinical Trial
We are conducting an exploratory Phase 2a, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 12-week, dose-ranging trial. The objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PD of two fixed doses of CVL-871 in male and female subjects aged 50 to 85 years who have clinically significant apathy and a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia (inclusive of possible/probable Alzheimer’s disease dementia, possible/probable dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia or vascular dementia). The trial will include a four-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and a four-week safety follow-up period. Approximately 75 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to three treatment groups: 1 mg QD of CVL-871, 3 mg QD of CVL-871 or placebo, as shown in the figure below.



Several clinical assessments will be utilized to measure change in apathy severity during treatment, and these assessments will be evaluated as potential primary endpoint measures for late-stage trials. These include the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) apathy domain, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician (NPI-C) apathy domain, the Dementia Apathy Interview and Rating (DAIR), and the Apathy Evaluation Scale-Clinician (AES-C). The NPI will also be used to assess changes in other neuropsychiatric symptoms. In addition, several measures will be utilized to assess changes in cognition, function (e.g. activities of basic living, and cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance), and caregiver burden. Data from this trial are expected in the first half of 2023.

Our Other Programs
 CVL-354
CVL-354 is a KORA for the treatment of MDD and substance use disorder. Kappa opioid receptors, or KORs, are G-protein coupled receptors that are expressed throughout the CNS, but particularly in circuits linked to motivation and anxiety. KOR activation is associated with neural networks linked to stress, depression and anxiety. In substance use disorder specifically, our goal is to reduce the physical symptoms and anxiety associated with withdrawal and thereby help patients recovering from addiction to maintain abstinence. CVL-354 is a high potency KORA and has 30-fold selectivity for KOR over the mu opioid receptor, or MOR. Notably, CVL-354 has no agonist activity at the MOR. CVL-354 has shown robust activity in preclinical animal models. Our preclinical safety package to date demonstrated approximately 20-fold safety margins over predicted efficacious exposures, and we believe the data support dosing for up to 90 days in humans. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 SAD and MAD trial of CVL-354 in healthy volunteers.
CVL-047
 CVL-047 is our selective PDE4 inhibitor (PDE4D-sparing) for the treatment of MDD and schizophrenia. Non-selective PDE4 inhibitors, including rolipram, have been reported to have shown antidepressant, antipsychotic, pro-cognitive and anti-inflammatory activity. However, gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and emesis have been dose-limiting in all PDE4 inhibitors tested in clinical trials to date. The gastrointestinal side effects that have hindered development for non-selective PDE4 inhibitors are widely believed to be more specifically linked to inhibition of the PDE4D subtype. CVL-047 is designed to be more selective for PDE4A, PDE4B and PDE4C over PDE4D and has demonstrated promising overall preclinical properties. This has resulted in a reduced emetic response to treatment in non-human primate models, suggesting the potential for CVL-047 to deliver the benefits of PDE4 inhibition while minimizing the gastrointestinal side effects linked to PDE4D inhibition. CVL-047 has demonstrated antipsychotic activity in several preclinical assays, including the pre-pulse inhibition and conditioned avoidance response models. In addition to depression, we believe PDE4 inhibition has the potential to treat psychosis in schizophrenia.
M4 Agonist Program
 We are also expanding our M4 franchise with additional product candidates that have pharmacology tailored to specific indications. Based on early preclinical evidence and strong biological rationale, we are evaluating highly-selective M4 full and partial agonists for potential use in psychosis. We are currently in the process of identifying and advancing a lead candidate for this program.
CVL-936
We are developing CVL-936 for the treatment of substance use disorder, with an initial focus on opioid use disorder. In order to maximize potential for activity, CVL-936, a selective dopamine D3-preferring, D2/D3 receptor subtype antagonist, was designed to block D3 signaling within the brain while also simultaneously reducing (but not fully inhibiting) signaling at the D2 receptor subtype. CVL-936 has shown encouraging activity in translationally relevant preclinical models of both cessation and relapse using nicotine and opioid-induced cues. We initiated a Phase 1 SAD trial in healthy volunteers in January 2020. We concluded dosing of Cohort 1 of the Phase 1 SAD trial after receiving sufficient clinical data for the intended purposes for this trial. We have completed a multiple dose canine EEG study and are evaluating the results of this study and the future of this program.
LRRK2 Inhibitor
Mutations within the LRRK2 gene are some of the most highly validated genetic risk factors for Parkinson’s, with variants being associated with both familial and sporadic disease. The most common Parkinson’s risk mutation in the LRRK2 gene is the G2019S variant, which is estimated to explain 3-6% of familial and 1-2% of sporadic Parkinson’s worldwide. Knockdown of the LRRK2 gene has been shown to reduce both pathological forms of alpha-synuclein and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in preclinical models, suggesting that LRRK2 inhibitors may benefit all Parkinson’s patients, not just those carrying LRRK2 mutations. We have developed a highly potent and selective LRRK2 kinase inhibitor that we believe has the potential to address disease progression in Parkinson’s.

Early Pipeline Target and Lead Identification Strategy
Our approach for target identification focuses on neuroscience targets with the highest levels of biological validation, as demonstrated through human pharmacological activity, our understanding of human disease biology and causal genetic association to disease. Through prioritizing a combination of both target tractability and target validation, we believe that we can more efficiently focus our early discovery efforts and resources on high probability of success opportunities that are the most likely to achieve clinical proof-of-concept, and ultimately, drug approval. Within our labs, we will leverage human genome sequencing and cutting-edge technologies such as genetically engineered brain organoids to identify causal relationships among single nucleotide polymorphs in idiopathic disease populations to identify novel associations between genetic pathways and disease. To date, we have successfully identified new targets that demonstrate gene dosage effects on disease phenotypes, including a pharmaceutically tractable gene that can both accelerate and reduce alpha-synuclein accumulation. Based on these data, we believe that we have the opportunity to identify compounds for use in modifying Parkinson’s through modulation of alpha-synuclein levels to potentially prevent or slow the advancement of the disease. Additionally, based upon human genetics, prior clinical trials and pharmacology studies, we have identified two novel targets that have the potential to address pruritis and pain.
Our model for lead identification follows a philosophy of looking broadly to identify the most tractable chemical matter as a starting point for creating future clinical development compounds, and ultimately, approved drugs. The largest pharmaceutical companies manage internal chemical compound libraries of two to three million structures from an estimated 1060 total possible chemical structures. These internal chemical libraries are skewed towards classes of protein targets that have been the focus of earlier programs, creating a chemical structure bias in the libraries that are represented in each individual company’s compound library. Our technology-enabled approach for lead identification of chemical matter leverages new technologies to not only screen a much larger selection of chemical structures, but also to sample it in an unbiased manner. For example, current DNA-encoded libraries, or DELs, range from 50 to 100 billion chemical structures and are built randomly without bias. Each compound within a DEL is ligated to a unique DNA sequence that serves as a “barcode” for identifying the chemical structure of compounds of interest after a successful binding structure has been identified. This DNA barcode approach also allows for pooled screening of massive compound libraries, ultimately leading to what we believe is a more efficient process to identify structural epitopes of chemical leads that are designed to advance into more intensive screening assays in a shorter timeframe than single compound screening approaches.
In addition to wet lab technologies, we are also coupling our DEL approaches with artificial intelligence, or AI, assisted drug design. AI-based in silico drug design has made dramatic progress over the past several years in areas such as deep learning and generative adversarial network methods that have created an entirely virtual approach to designing potent and selective small molecules based upon predicted crystal structure of protein targets and potential small molecule epitope interactions. These AI-based drug design systems are trained on chemical binding and drug-target interactions to rapidly generate unique chemical matter for synthesis and testing. Reiterative refinement can generate novel chemical leads. Through a combination of unique starting material identified via DEL screening and refined design via AI, unique chemical leads can be efficiently generated, providing us with an advantage in compound optimization with the greatest likelihood of creating novel intellectual property. By combining these approaches for the identification of lead chemical structures, we can focus our research investment on higher value data generation for lead optimization.
Our internal research laboratories include capabilities aimed at discovering receptor-selective molecules with carefully designed pharmacological activity. We leverage electrophysiological and PD characterization to develop molecules that may be able to normalize neurocircuitry in neuroscience disease and minimize potential for side effects. We evaluate chemical leads in house using both physiological and behavioral approaches to characterize their neural activity at the level of the intact CNS in model organisms.
Manufacturing and Supply
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently source all of our preclinical and clinical supply through third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs.
For clinical supply, we use CMOs who act in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLP, and current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, for the manufacture of drug substance and product. We expect to rely on third parties for our manufacturing processes and the production of all clinical supply drug substance and drug product. We use additional contract manufacturers to fill, label, package, store and distribute investigational drug products. It is our intent to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of an NDA to the FDA for any product candidates that complete clinical development.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. While we believe our product candidates, approach, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies as well as public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with approved treatment options, including off-label therapies, and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly or earlier than us, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors.
Schizophrenia
We are developing emraclidine for the treatment of schizophrenia. While there remains significant unmet need in schizophrenia, we may face competition from second-generation atypical antipsychotic treatments that work primarily by inhibiting D2 receptors as their primary mechanism of action. These drugs include: Abilify and Abilify Maintena, marketed by Otsuka Holdings; Invega Trinza and Invega Sustenna, marketed by Johnson & Johnson; Aristada, marketed by Alkermes; Zyprexa, marketed by Eli Lilly; Vraylar, marketed by Allergan; Caplyta, marketed by Intra-Cellular Therapies; and Latuda, marketed by Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma.
Additionally, we are aware of several product candidates in clinical development that are designed to modulate dopamine, serotonin and/or muscarinic receptors, including product candidates being developed by Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, Minerva Neurosciences, Neurocrine Biosciences and Karuna Therapeutics.
Epilepsy
We are developing darigabat for the treatment of epilepsy. Darigabat may face competition from a variety of currently marketed therapies such as generic anticonvulsants, AEDs, sodium channel modulators and BZDs, as well as surgical options such as deep brain stimulation in patients who have failed polypharmacy. We may also face competition from XCOPRI® (cenobamate), which was developed by SK Life Sciences and was approved by the FDA in November 2019. Additionally, there are next-generation therapies in development harnessing the previously mentioned mechanisms of action, such as NBI-921352 (formerly known as XEN901) being developed by Neurocrine Biosciences and XEN1101 being developed by Xenon Pharmaceuticals.


We may also face competition from other companies developing next-generation GABAA receptor modulators such as Sage Therapeutics and Marinus Pharmaceuticals, among others, as well as several companies, such as VistaGen Therapeutics, developing molecules targeting the NMDA receptor as both antagonists and agonists. There are also several therapies that are either marketed or in development targeting rarer forms of epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet Syndrome that could have efficacy in broader epileptic populations, including fenfluramine from Zogenix (which has announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by UCB) and cannabinoid-based therapies from GW Pharmaceuticals (now part of Jazz Pharmaceuticals).
Parkinson’s Disease
We are developing tavapadon for the treatment of early- and late-stage Parkinson’s. We may face competition from currently available treatments for both stages of disease, such as L-dopa, D2/D3-preferring agonists and MAO-B inhibitors as monotherapy or in combination, as well as deep brain stimulation devices by Medtronic Inc. and St. Jude Medical Inc., among others, for the later stages of disease. Additionally, we are aware of several potential symptomatic and disease-modifying therapeutics being developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Denali, Prothena, Roche, Voyager Therapeutics, Prevail Therapeutics, Sage Therapeutics, Neurocrine Biosciences, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, and IRLAB Therapeutics, that are in various stages of clinical development. These companies are employing a variety of therapeutic modalities, including gene therapy and gene editing, in addition to small molecule chemistry, to address Parkinson’s.
Pfizer License Agreement
In August 2018, we entered into the Pfizer License Agreement pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain Pfizer patent rights, and a non-exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain Pfizer know-how, to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain compounds and products, which currently constitute the product candidates included in the table in the section entitled “–Our Pipeline,” in the field of treatment, prevention, diagnosis, control and maintenance of all diseases and disorders in humans, subject to the terms and conditions of the Pfizer License Agreement. The license excludes the field of treatment, prevention, diagnosis, control and maintenance of inflammatory bowel diseases and disorders in humans by compounds or products exerting a therapeutic effect on the LRRK2 target, which is retained by Pfizer. Under the terms of the Pfizer License Agreement, Pfizer is granted a non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license under intellectual property we develop during the term of the agreement for all purposes in the LRRK2 field retained by Pfizer. Additionally, Pfizer has an exclusive right of first negotiation in the event that we seek to enter into any significant transaction with a third party with respect to a product either globally or in certain designated countries. Significant transactions include exclusive licenses, assignments, sales, exclusive co-promotion arrangements, and other transfers of all commercial rights to a product globally or in certain designated countries, as well as exclusive distribution agreements globally or in certain designated countries.
Under the Pfizer License Agreement, we are solely responsible for the development, manufacture, regulatory approval and commercialization of compounds and products in the field. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for a product that contains or incorporates one of certain scheduled compounds to exert a therapeutic effect on certain targets, in each of the following countries: United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, China, Japan and the United States, each a major market country. We are also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize each such product, if approved, in each major market country in which regulatory approval for such product has been obtained. The Pfizer License Agreement requires Pfizer to transfer certain know-how and data, regulatory filings and materials, inventory, and other materials, records and documents, and provide certain other transitional support and assistance which has been and is expected to be immaterial, to us to facilitate our development, manufacture and commercialization of compounds and products in the field.
As partial consideration for the licensed assets, we issued to Pfizer 3,833,333.33 shares of Old Cerevel Series A-2 Preferred Stock with an estimated fair value of $100.4 million or $26.20 per share. We also reimbursed Pfizer for $11.0 million of direct expenses related to the Pfizer License Agreement, bringing the total initial consideration to $111.4 million.
Under the terms of the Pfizer License Agreement, we are also required to make regulatory approval milestone payments to Pfizer, ranging from $7.5 million to $40.0 million on a compound-by-compound basis, upon the first regulatory approval in the United States for the first product containing or comprised of a given compound, with the

amount of the payments determined by which designated group the compound falls into and with each such group generally characterized by the compounds’ stage of development. Each such regulatory approval milestone is payable only once per compound. If all of our product candidates included in the table in the section entitled “—Our Pipeline” are approved in the United States, the total aggregate amount of such regulatory approval milestones payable to Pfizer would be approximately $220.0 million.
In addition, we are required to pay Pfizer commercial milestone payments up to an aggregate of $170.0 million per product when aggregate net sales of products under the Pfizer License Agreement in a calendar year first reach various thresholds ranging from $500.0 million to $2.0 billion. Each commercial milestone payment is payable only once upon first achievement of the applicable commercial milestone. If all of our product candidates included in the table in the section entitled “—Our Pipeline” achieve all of the commercial milestones, the total aggregate amount of such commercial milestones payable to Pfizer would total approximately $1.7 billion.
We are also required to pay Pfizer tiered royalties on the aggregate net sales during each calendar year, determined on a product-by-product basis with respect to products under the Pfizer License Agreement, at percentages ranging from the low-single digits to mid-teens, with the royalty rate determined by which designated group the applicable compound for such product falls into and with each such group generally characterized by the compounds’ stage of development, and subject to certain royalty deductions for the expiration of patent, regulatory and data exclusivity, generic competition and third-party royalty payments as set forth in the Pfizer License Agreement. The royalty term expires, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, on the later of (1) expiration of all regulatory or data exclusivity for such product in such country, (2) the date upon which the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or importation of such product in such country would no longer infringe, but for the license granted in the Pfizer License Agreement, a valid claim of the licensed patents and (3) 12 years following the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
Pfizer can terminate the Pfizer License Agreement in its entirety upon our material breach, subject to specified notice and cure provisions. However, if such material breach is with respect to one or more, but not all, products, targets or countries, Pfizer’s right to terminate is only with respect to such products, targets or countries. Either party may terminate the Pfizer License Agreement in its entirety upon event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding of the other party or a force majeure event that prohibits the other party from performing for a period of time. Absent early termination, the term of the Pfizer License Agreement will continue on a country-by-country basis and product-by-product basis, until the expiration of the royalty term for the country and the product. Upon Pfizer’s termination of the Pfizer License Agreement for our material breach or either party’s termination for bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding or force majeure, we would grant Pfizer an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual license under certain intellectual property we develop during the term of the Pfizer License Agreement. In addition, we would negotiate a transition plan with Pfizer that would address, among other things, the transfer of know-how and data, regulatory approvals and filings and materials, inventory and other materials, records and documents, and the provision of certain other transitional support and assistance for the terminated products, targets or countries.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing and maintaining patent protection intended to cover our product candidates and their methods of use, as well as other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that we do not consider appropriate for patent protection.
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technologies, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, particularly our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others.
The patent positions for biotechnology companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our platform technologies and product candidates will receive protection from or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide

sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
Patents
Shortly after our formation in July 2018, we entered into the Pfizer License Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired exclusive worldwide rights under Pfizer patents, patent applications and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize our current product candidates.
We have exclusive licenses under the Pfizer License Agreement to patent rights in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to our product candidates. As of December 31, 2021, the patent rights in-licensed under the Pfizer License Agreement include:

 See the section entitled “—Pfizer License Agreement” for additional information on our rights under the Pfizer License Agreement.
Trade Secrets
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and partners. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Trademarks
As of December 31, 2021, our registered trademark portfolio contained 46 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Japan, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Venezuela. In addition, we have two registered

trademarks and one allowed trademark application in the U.S. Further, there are 13 pending trademark applications in foreign jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, Canada, China, the European Union and South Korea.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice or other governmental entities. In addition, an applicant may need to recall a product.
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
•completion of nonclinical, or preclinical, laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated at that site; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA and payment of user fees; 
 •review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA; and 
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA. 
 Preclinical Studies
Before an applicant begins testing a compound in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or API and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and

activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive AEs and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
The IND and IRB Processes
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of the investigational drug. In an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. The FDA also may impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold after commencement of a clinical trial under an IND. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation (or full investigation in the case of a partial clinical hold) may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. FDA must also be able to validate the data from the study through an on-site inspection if necessary.
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review of the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects, or their legal representative, provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among

other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine maximal dosage. 
 •Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
 •Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
 Post-approval studies, often referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial regulatory approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. In addition, within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the applicant must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Review of an NDA by the FDA
Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a significant application user fee as well as annual prescription drug product program fees. These fees are typically increased annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt, before accepting the NDA for filing, to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Applications for drugs containing new molecular entities are meant to be reviewed within 10 months from the date of filing, and applications for

“priority review” products containing new molecular entities are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
During its review of an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA, including drug component manufacturing (such as APIs), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an NDA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential AEs, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product.
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Priority Review
The FDA has a number of programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. Three of these programs are referred to as Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review designation.
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.

Third, the FDA may designate an NDA review for a priority review if it is for a product that treats a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from 10 months to six months.
Accelerated Approval Pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly.
The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, could result in the FDA’s withdrawal of the approval and require the withdrawal of the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and select clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA to address all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request a hearing. If the applicant resubmits the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter only when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety or effectiveness after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, reporting of adverse experiences with the product and applicable product tracking and tracing requirements. After approval, many changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are annual prescription drug product program fee requirements for certain marketed products.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the NDA holder and any third-party manufacturers that the NDA holder may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary product recalls; 
 •fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.

Hatch-Waxman Amendments
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product, known as a reference listed drug, or RLD. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
Non-Patent Exclusivity
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity, or NCE. For the purposes of this provision, an NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, which states the proposed generic drug will not infringe one or more of the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity for non-NCE drugs if the NDA or a supplement to the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application or supplement. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication, but it generally would not protect the original, unmodified product from generic competition. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product; it only prevents FDA from approving such ANDAs.
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
In seeking approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Upon submission of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the RLD in the Orange Book that:
•no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; 
 •such patent has expired; 
 •the date on which such patent expires; or 


•such patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. 
 Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a paragraph IV certification the applicant must send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation. If the drug has NCE exclusivity and the ANDA is submitted four years after approval, the 30-month stay is extended so that it expires seven and a half years after approval of the innovator drug, unless the patent expires or there is a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant before then.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent term restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question and within 60 days of drug approval. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows similar lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union.

Clinical Trial Approval
In the European Union, an applicant for authorization of a clinical trial must obtain prior approval from the national competent authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the relevant independent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, or the Clinical Trials Regulation, was adopted in the European Union. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all the EU Member States and repeals the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as of January 31, 2022.
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application, as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by an elected Reference Member State, with support of the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted, or the Member States Concerned. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State Concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State, however, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
Marketing Authorization
To obtain a marketing authorization for a product in the European Union, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the EU Member States plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein).
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid throughout the EEA. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue-engineered products) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of HIV or AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from a public health perspective and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 67 days from the date of the CHMP opinion, the European Commission will adopt its final decision on the MAA.
Now that the United Kingdom (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the European Union, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the United Kingdom medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by

the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required. For additional information related to the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, please refer to the discussion below under the section entitled “—Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom.”
 The decentralized marketing authorization procedure allows an applicant to apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU Member State of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU Member State and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The Reference Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the Concerned Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a Concerned Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all Member States.
The mutual recognition procedure is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of another EU Member State. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.
Pediatric Development
 Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to two years before the SPC expires, even where the trial results are negative. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
Data and Market Exclusivity
 In the European Union, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized through the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar (abbreviated) marketing authorization, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MAA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization

based on an MAA with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals
A marketing authorization has an initial validity of five years. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the relevant EU Member State for a nationally authorized product. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least nine months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authorities of the relevant Member States decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five year renewal period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (for centrally-authorized products) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State (for nationally-authorized products) within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called "sunset clause").
Regulatory Requirements after a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
Where an authorization for a medicinal product in the European Union is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include:
•Compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations. 
 •The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and APIs, including the manufacture of APIs outside of the European Union with the intention to import the APIs into the European Union. 
 •The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union notably under Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, and EU Member State laws. 
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” and the United Kingdom ceased being a Member State of the European Union on January 31, 2020. There was an initial transition period during which EU medicinal product laws continued to apply in the United Kingdom, which ended on December 31, 2020. However, the European Union and the United Kingdom have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore currently aligns with EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in the future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the European Union and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. It remains to be seen, therefore, how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom in the long term.

European Data Collection Regulation
For our clinical trials in the European Union, we are subject to additional privacy restrictions and data protection requirements. The collection and use of personal data, including health information, in the European Union is governed primarily by the General Data Protection Regulation, (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR. This regulation imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to third countries, including the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in significant fines and other administrative penalties.
 Further to Brexit, the GDPR ceased to apply in the United Kingdom on December 31, 2020. However, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the United Kingdom’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the European Union’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in significant monetary penalties. Although the United Kingdom is regarded as a third country under the GDPR, the European Commission has issued a decision recognizing the United Kingdom as providing adequate protection under the GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the European Union to the United Kingdom remain unrestricted. Like the GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the United Kingdom to countries not regarded by the United Kingdom as providing adequate protection.
 Healthcare and Privacy Laws and Regulation
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business that may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. See “Risk Factors — Our relationships with healthcare providers and physicians and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings” for additional information.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and responsible individuals may be subject to imprisonment.
Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Healthcare Reform
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost- effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price, or ASP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Even if we do receive a favorable coverage determination for approved products by third-party payors, coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to request access to certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain

reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU Member States have the option to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
