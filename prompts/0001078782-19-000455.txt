ITEM 1. BUSINESS
(A) BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
 
Kyto Technology and Life Science, Inc. was formed as a Florida corporation on March 5, 1999 under the name of B12 Inc. In August, 2002, the Company changed its name from B Twelve, Inc. to Kyto BioPharma Inc. and in May 2018, the name was changed again to Kyto Technology and Life Science, Inc. 
 
The Company was originally formed to acquire and develop innovative minimally toxic and non-immunosuppressive proprietary drugs for the treatment of cancer, arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases and had been looking at a number of strategies to become active. In April, 2018, the Board adopted a new business plan focused on the development of early stage technology and life science businesses through early stage investment funding. The Company has recruited a number of experienced investment consultants from a network that includes angel investors, corporate managers, and successful entrepreneurs across a number of technology and life science products and markets and relies on input from these advisors in conducting due diligence and making investment decisions. In order to offset the risk in early stage investing, the Company works with angel investment groups and participates only after these groups have committed to invest, and does not invest more than $250,000 in any single investment. The Company plans to generate revenue from two sources: (i) the sale of advisory services to its target investments and (ii) realised gains from the sale of the businesses in which it has invested. Generally, it is expected that investments will be realised from an exit within a period of four years following investment. 
 
The Company has no regular employees, full-time or part-time. The chief executive officer of Kyto Technology and Life Science, Inc. is acting as a consultant to the Company and does not receive compensation.
