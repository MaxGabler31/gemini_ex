ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.

We are a leading innovator of sensory experiences that move the world. We co-create unique products that consumers taste, smell, or feel in fine fragrances and beauty, detergents and household goods, and food and beverages. Our approximately 7,300 team members globally take advantage of our capabilities in consumer insights, research and product development (“R&D”), creative expertise and customer intimacy to partner with our customers in developing innovative and differentiated offerings for consumer products. We believe that our collaborative approach will generate market share gains for our customers. 
Our international presence positions us to serve both our global customers and the increasing number of regional and high-end and middle-market specialty consumer goods producers. We operate thirty-seven manufacturing facilities and sixty-nine creative centers and application laboratories located in thirty-seven different countries. We partner with our customers to develop over 46,000 products that are provided to customers in approximately 162 countries. 
We principally compete in the flavors and fragrances market, which is part of a larger market that supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds used in consumer products. The broader market includes large multi-national companies and smaller regional and local participants that supply products such as seasonings, texturizers, spices, enzymes, certain food-related commodities, fortified products and cosmetic ingredients. The global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently, primarily as a result of an increase in demand for, and an increase in the variety of, consumer products containing flavors and fragrances. Management estimates that in 2017 the flavors and fragrances market was approximately $24.8 billion, and forecasted to grow approximately 2-3% by 2021, primarily driven by expected growth in emerging markets.
In 2017, we achieved sales of approximately $3.4 billion, making us one of the top four companies in the global flavors and fragrances sub-segment of the broader consumer products ingredients and compounds market. We believe that our global presence, diversified business platform, broad product portfolio and global and regional customer base position us to achieve long-term growth as the flavors and fragrances markets expand.
We operate in two business segments, Flavors and Fragrances. In 2017, our Flavors business represented 48% of our sales, while our Fragrances business represented 52% of sales. Our business is geographically diverse, with sales to customers in the four regions set forth below:

Region | % of 2017 Sales
Europe, Africa, Middle East | 31 | %
Greater Asia | 27 | %
North America | 27 | %
Latin America | 15 | %

We are committed to winning in emerging markets. We believe that more significant future growth potential for the flavors and fragrances industry, and for our business, exists in the emerging markets (all markets except North America, Japan, Australia, and Western, Southern and Northern Europe). Over the past five years our currency neutral sales growth rate in emerging markets has outpaced that of developed markets. We expect this long-term trend to continue for the foreseeable future.
We have operated in some of the largest emerging markets for multiple decades. As a result of these established operations, sales in emerging markets represented 48% of 2017 sales and 51% of 2016 sales. As our customers seek to grow their businesses in emerging markets, we provide them the ability to leverage our long-standing international presence and extensive market knowledge to help drive their brands in these markets. To stay competitive in our industry, we must adapt to rapidly shifting consumer preferences and customer demands. We believe our consumer insights and customer relationships help to drive innovation that benefits us and our customers. During 2017, our 25 largest customers accounted for 50% of our sales. Sales to our largest customer across all end-use categories accounted for 11% to 12% of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years. These sales were principally in our Fragrances business.

Vision 2020 Strategy 
We continued to execute against the four pillars of our Vision 2020 strategy originally announced in 2015 and refreshed in 2017, which focuses on building differentiation and accelerating growth to create shareholder value:

(1) | Innovating Firsts - We seek to strengthen our position by driving differentiation in priority R&D platforms across both businesses. In 2017, we launched three captive fragrance molecules and three new flavor modulators. We achieved continued growth of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio sales and encapsulated-related sales. We also launched Re-Imagine, a program to accelerate flavor innovation and increase agility to capture unmet opportunities in the changing food and beverage market.


(2) | Winning Where We Compete - Our goal is to achieve a #1 or #2 market leadership position in key markets and categories and with specific customers. In 2017, we grew our sales in both our Flavors and Fragrances businesses in North America and the Middle East and Africa, geographic area we targeted for growth. We also created Tastepoint by IFF, designed to leverage our expertise in and to service the middle-market customer in North America, and opened an expanded facility in Cairo, Egypt to support our regional focus on growth in the Middle East and Africa.


(3) | Becoming Our Customers' Partner of Choice - Our goal is to attain commercial excellence by providing our customers with in-depth, local consumer understanding, industry-leading innovation, outstanding service and the highest quality products. In 2017, we introduced IFF Taste Design, a combination of artisanal, handcrafted techniques and proprietary technologies that drive consumer preference and market differentiation. In addition, we were rated gold by EcoVadis for sustainability, received an “A” rating and were awarded leadership status for our climate change and an "A-" for water management strategy by CDP.


(4) | Strengthening and Expanding the Portfolio - We actively pursue value-creation through partnerships, collaborations, and acquisitions within flavors, fragrances and adjacencies. We prioritize opportunities that provide (i) access to new technologies, (ii) the ability to increase our market share in key markets and with key customers or (iii) access to adjacent products or services that will position us to leverage our expertise in science and technology and our customer base. During 2017, we acquired Fragrance Resources to further improve our market position with regional customers in specialty fine fragrances, and PowderPure to further expand product offerings of clean label flavors solutions. We also became the first sensorial innovator of flavors, fragrances and cosmetic actives to join the MIT Media Lab, a leader in research and technologies that transform the everyday for consumers around the world.

Our Product Offerings
Flavors
Flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and, as such, play a significant role in determining consumer preference for the end products in which they are used. As a leading creator of flavor compounds, we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers. While we are a global leader, our Flavors business is more regional in nature, with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences. We create our flavors in our regional creative centers which allow us to satisfy local taste preferences, while also helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards. We develop thousands of different flavors and taste offerings for our customers, most of which are tailor-made. We continually develop new formulas in order to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs.
Our Flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in the following four end-use categories of consumer goods: (1) Savory, for use in soups, sauces, condiments, prepared meals, meat and poultry, potato chips and other savory snacks; (2) Beverages, for use in juice drinks, carbonated beverages, flavored waters and spirits, (3) Sweet, for use in bakery products, candy, chewing gum and cereal and (4) Dairy, for use in all dairy products such as yogurt, ice cream and cheese and other products that have a creamy flavor.
 4

We continue to build upon our strengths and to focus on addressing industry trends that will allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and deliver accelerated growth consistent with our Vision 2020 strategy. These trends include:

• | Continued Consumer Demand for Fresh, Clean and Authentic Products. Consumers in developed markets increasingly want to make food choices that promote a healthy lifestyle and are moving towards products with “all natural” or healthier ingredients. In addition, consumers, non-governmental organizations and governmental agencies are seeking more transparency in product labeling. In response, many of our customers are announcing initiatives to provide “clean label” products (products that do not include any artificial ingredients). As a result of these trends, we believe our Vision 2020 strategy’s focus on innovation, including our modulation technology, delivery systems and our naturals and proprietary ingredients will help our customers address changing consumer demands. In 2017, we acquired PowderPure, a company that used a specialized drying technology to create all-natural flavors by eliminating water while leaving the taste, nutrition and color matrix intact.


• | Expansion of Consumer Food Companies. The number of participants in the food industry continues to expand, with mid-sized regional companies and companies focused on niche-product categories joining the traditional global companies to drive and accelerate product innovation. As a result, larger food and beverage companies are seeing slower growth than in previous years. We continue to look for innovative and value-creating methods for serving this growing customer base. In 2017, we announced the creation of Tastepoint by IFF, representing the collaboration of Ottens Flavors and David Michael, a program designed to service the middle-market customer in North America by providing the approach of a smaller company, backed by expertise traditionally reserved for companies with a more global reach.

Fragrances
Our Fragrances business derives revenue from two sources, Fragrance Compounds and Ingredients.
We are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and best-known consumer products, within fabric care, home care, personal wash, hair care and toiletries. Our Fragrance ingredients business is a vertically integrated operation, originating with the development in our research laboratories of naturals, synthetic and proprietary molecules and innovative delivery systems, progressing to our manufacturing facilities that produce these ingredients in a consistent, high-quality and cost-effective manner and transitioning to our creative centers and application laboratories where our perfumers partner with our customers to create unique fragrance compounds for use in a variety of end-use products. We also produce cosmetic active and functional ingredients for use in cosmetics.
By providing our fragrance development teams with an extensive portfolio of innovative, high-quality and effective ingredients to support their creativity, we are able to provide our customers with a unique identity for their brands. These ingredients or fragrance compounds can then be combined with our innovative delivery systems, including our proprietary encapsulation technology, which consists of individual fragrance droplets coated with a protective polymeric shell to deliver superior fragrance performance throughout a product's lifecycle. These delivery systems are key differentiators in the growth of our consumer fragrance compounds.
Fragrance Compounds. Fragrance Compounds are unique and proprietary combinations of multiple ingredients that are ultimately used by our customers in their consumer goods. Our creative and commercial teams within Fragrance Compounds are organized into two broad categories, Fine Fragrances and Consumer Fragrances.

(1) | Fine Fragrances - Fine Fragrances focuses on perfumes and colognes. IFF’s scientists and perfumers collaborate to develop new molecules, new natural extractions, and innovative processes that enliven perfumers' palettes and help them create unique, inspiring fragrances. We have created some of the industry-leading fine fragrance classics as well as cutting-edge niche fragrances, as evidenced by the number of top sellers.


(2) | Consumer Fragrances - Our Consumer Fragrances include five end-use categories of products:


i. | Fabric Care - laundry detergents, fabric softeners and specialty laundry products;


ii. | Home Care - household cleaners, dishwashing detergents and air fresheners;


iii. | Personal Wash, including bar soap and shower gel;


iv. | Hair Care; and


v. | Toiletries.

Ingredients. Fragrance Ingredients consists of active and functional ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties, including customers and competitors, for use in preparation of compounds. While the principal role of our Fragrance 
 5

Ingredients facilities is to support our Fragrance Compounds business, we utilize our excess manufacturing capacity to manufacture and sell certain fragrance ingredients to third parties. We believe that this business allows us to leverage our fixed costs while maintaining the security of supply for our perfumers and ultimately our customers. Fragrance Ingredients available for sale to third parties include innovative ingredients that leverage our manufacturing experience as well as a limited amount of cost-competitive, commodity ingredients. As our Fragrance Compounds business grows, we expect that the percentage of capacity allocated to the production of Fragrance Ingredients for sale to third parties may decrease. Fragrance Ingredients also includes our cosmetic active and functional ingredients, which provide biologists and cosmetic chemists with innovative solutions to address cosmetic challenges such as skin aging and hair protection.
With approximately 1,300 separate fragrance and active and functional cosmetic ingredients, plus additional botanicals and delivery systems, we believe we are a leader in the industry with the breadth of our product portfolio.
Consistent with our Vision 2020 strategy, Fragrances continues to build upon our strengths to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, address evolving consumer demands and deliver accelerated growth. Specifically, we intend to focus on:

(1) | Delivery Systems. We continue to invest in our delivery system technologies, including expansion of our market-leading encapsulation technology, which we believe will allow us to differentiate our products and those of our customers. Our encapsulation technology extends, controls the release of and increases aromas in a variety of consumer products. We have expanded our portfolio to offer multi-functional delivery systems with cosmetic actives that work to enhance skin penetration, protect the active against interactions with other ingredients, provide long-lasting release, facilitate formulation of challenging ingredients and allow a better-targeted action.


(2) | Consumer Demand for Natural and Organic Products. Increased demand for natural ingredients is a primary driver of future growth in Fine Fragrances. We believe that our in-house naturals operations, led by Laboratoire Monique Rémy (“LMR”) in Grasse, France, are industry leading in the processing of quality materials and offer decades of experience understanding natural products and perfecting the process of transforming naturals, such as narcissus, jasmine and blackcurrant bud, into pure absolutes that retain the unique fragrance of their origin. Our objective is to expand our naturals capabilities by offering our clients naturals and proprietary ingredients.


(3) | Transparency in Labeling. As consumers worldwide seek to require transparency in labeling, our customers will progressively seek to differentiate their products through proprietary molecules. A major emphasis of our research program is the creation of new proprietary molecules and ingredients.

Research and Product Development Process
Consumer Insights 
We believe that the first step to creating a unique scent or taste experience begins with gaining insight into the consumer. By developing a deep understanding of what consumers value and prefer, we are better able to focus our R&D and creative efforts. Our quest to bring innovative, exciting, and winning ideas to our clients begins with insight into the consumer.
Our consumer insight and marketing teams work tirelessly interpreting trends, monitoring product launches, analyzing quantitative market data, and conducting numerous consumer interviews annually. Our sensory experts direct research programs exploring topics such as fragrance performance, the psychophysics of sensory perception (including chemesthetic properties such as warming, cooling, and tingling), the genetic basis for flavor and fragrance preference, and the effects of aromas on mood, performance, health, and well-being.
Based on this information, we develop innovative programs to evaluate potential products that enable us to understand the emotional connections between a prospective product and the consumer. We believe this ability to pinpoint the likelihood of a product’s success translates into stronger brand equity, resulting in increased returns and greater market share gains for our customers as well as IFF.
Research and Development
We consider our R&D infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative molecules, compounds, formulas and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products. We spend approximately 8% of our sales on the research, development and implementation of new molecules, compounds and technologies that help our customers respond to changing consumer preferences. Using the knowledge gained from our Consumer Insights program, we strategically focus our resources around key R&D platforms that address consumer needs or preferences, or anticipate future preferences. By aligning our resources around these platforms, we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that it can be further developed and eventually accepted for 
 6

commercial application. As a result of this investment, we have been granted 341 patents in the United States since 2000, including twenty-seven in 2017, and we have developed many unique molecules and delivery systems for our customers that are used as the foundations of successful flavors and fragrances around the world.
We principally conduct our R&D activities in Union Beach, New Jersey, where we employ scientists and application engineers who collaborate with our five other R&D centers around the world, to support the:

• | discovery of new materials;


• | development of new technologies, such as delivery systems;


• | creation of new compounds; and


• | enhancement of existing ingredients and compounds.

As of December 31, 2017, we employed about 1,600 people globally in R&D activities. We spent $286.0 million, $254.3 million and $246.1 million, or approximately 8.4%, 8.2% and 8.1% of sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on R&D activities.
Our ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their sensorial value. To broaden our offerings of natural, innovative and unique products, we seek collaborations with research institutions and other companies throughout the world. We have established a number of such collaborations to strengthen our innovation pipeline. We may also consider acquiring companies that could provide access to new technologies, consistent with our Vision 2020 strategy. 
The development of new and customized flavor and fragrance compounds is a complex process calling upon the combined knowledge of our scientists, flavorists and perfumers. Scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with flavorists and perfumers to develop flavor and fragrance compounds with consumer preferred performance characteristics. The development of new flavor and fragrance compounds requires (i) an in-depth knowledge of the flavor and fragrance characteristics of the various ingredients we use, (ii) an understanding of how the many ingredients in a consumer product interact and (iii) the creation of controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance. To facilitate this process, we have a scientific advisory board that provides external perspectives and independent feedback on our R&D and sustainability initiatives.
In 2017, we launched Re-Imagine, a multi-tiered program to accelerate innovation and increase agility to capture unmet opportunities in the changing food and beverage market. Based on a combination of future trends analysis, consumer insights, and a modernized cross-category development process, the program guides our research and development efforts to ensure an innovation pipeline that addresses evolving consumer needs and desires. 
Creative Application 
We also have a network of sixty-nine creative centers and application laboratories around the world where we create or adapt the basic flavors or fragrances that we have developed in the R&D process to commercialize for use in our customers’ consumer products. Our global creative teams consist of perfumers, fragrance evaluators and flavorists, as well as marketing, consumer insights and technical application experts, from a wide range of cultures and nationalities. In close partnership with our customers’ product development groups, our creative teams create the sensory experiences that our customers are seeking in order to satisfy consumer demands in each of their markets.
Development of new flavors and fragrances is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers, who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product, or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our Consumer Insights program. Our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance. A collaborative process between our researchers, our product development team and our customers then follows to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product.
In addition to creating new flavors and fragrances, our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by adjusting or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials or by modifying the current ingredients to produce an enhanced yield. This often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers.
Our flavor and fragrance compound formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary asset. Our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent, trademark or license.

Supply Chain
We strive to provide our customers with consistent quality products on a timely and cost-effective basis by managing all aspects of the supply chain, from raw material sourcing through manufacturing, quality assurance, regulatory compliance and distribution.
Procurement
In connection with the manufacture of compounds, we use natural ingredients and, primarily in our fragrance compounds, synthetic ingredients. We purchase approximately 11,000 different raw materials from about 3,000 domestic and international suppliers and distributors. Approximately half of the materials we purchase are naturals or crop-related items and the other half are synthetics and chemicals. Natural ingredients are derived from flowers, fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products. They contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product. Natural products are purchased in processed or semi-processed form. Some are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others are used after further processing. Natural products, together with various chemicals, are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes. Our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits, vegetables, nuts, herbs and spices as well as microbiologically-derived ingredients. 
In order to ensure our supply of raw materials, achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers, we continue to be focused on (i) implementing a forward-buy strategy, (ii) entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies that we do not have, (iii) implementing indexed pricing, (iv) reducing the complexity of our formulations and (v) evaluating whether it is more profitable to buy or make an ingredient. We are also concentrating on local country sourcing with our own procurement professionals.
Manufacturing and Distribution
We have thirty-seven manufacturing sites around the world that supports more than 46,000 products. Our major manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, the Netherlands, Spain, Great Britain, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, China, India, and Singapore. Our supply chain initiatives in developing markets are focused on increasing capacity and investments in key technologies. Within our more mature markets, we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as implementing new technologies. In addition to our own manufacturing facilities, we develop relationships with third parties, including contract manufacturing organizations that permit us to expand access to the technologies, capabilities and capacity that we need to better serve our customers.
Based on the regional nature of the Flavors business and the concerns regarding the fragile nature of transporting raw materials, we have established smaller manufacturing facilities in our local markets that are focused on local needs. Products within the Fragrances business are typically composed of compounds that are more stable and more transportable around the world. Consequently, we have fewer manufacturing facilities within our Fragrances business, which produce compounds and ingredients for global distribution.
In 2017, we continued to invest in our facilities. Major capital projects included the construction of a second Flavors compounding site in China, breaking ground on a new Flavors and Fragrances plant in India as well as completing the relocation of one of our Fragrance Ingredients plants to a new site in Jiande, China. In addition, we reached an agreement to relocate our other Fragrance Ingredients facility in China from Hangzhou to the Jiande site by 2020. 
Sustainability
As a leading global creator of flavors and fragrances for a wide variety of consumer products, sustainability has been an important part of how we do business. Our sustainability strategy is centered on three main aspects: Positive Principles, Regenerative Products and Sensational People. 

• | Positive Principles - We seek to embed the principles of eliminating the concept of waste, using clean renewable energy, and celebrating diversity into our company and culture.


• | Regenerative Products - We strive to intentionally design our products to continuously support well-being and have a positive contribution to society and the environment in a circular economy.


• | Sensational People - We seek to engage our employees and stakeholders to make a positive difference in the world.

In 2017, we joined Food Reform for Sustainability and Health (FReSH), a project of the World Business Council For Sustainable Development designed to improve the health of people and the planet by recalibrating the global systems of consumption, transportation, production and agriculture. Our participation in the food loss and waste work stream is aligned 
 8

with our strategy that calls for developing regenerative products using circular economy principles. We also partnered with Mars Wrigley Confectionery to enhance the livelihoods of farmers in India while securing our supply chain of high-quality natural mint. In addition, we were named by CDP to the Climate "A" list for the third consecutive year for our leadership in carbon management. CDP also awarded us leadership status for our water management strategy. In addition, we maintained "Gold" status with an EcoVadis score of 72 out of 100 points, placing us in the top 1% of suppliers in the industry segment. The EcoVadis platform promotes increased focus on sustainable performance throughout the supply chain, emphasizing the environment, fair labor and fair business practices.
Governmental Regulation
We develop, produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to federal, regional and local legislation and regulations in each of the various countries. Our flavor and many of our fragrance products are intended for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical industries, which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards. As a result, we are required to meet these strict standards which, in recent years, have become increasingly stringent.
Our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate. These agencies include (1) the Food and Drug Administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate flavors and other ingredients in consumer products, (2) the Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities, (3) the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing, research laboratories and creative centers, (4) local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs, (5) the Drug Enforcement Administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations and (6) the Chemical Registration/Notification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in, or transport to, the various countries in which we manufacture and/or market our products. We have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries, such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH") regulations in the European Union.
In addition, we are subject to various rules relating to health, work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate. Our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions, sewage discharges, the use of hazardous materials, waste disposal practices and clean-up of existing environmental contamination. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards, and the costs of compliance have risen significantly, a trend we expect will continue in the future.
Competition
The flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products. The broader market includes large multi-national companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings, texturizers, spices, enzymes, certain food-related commodities, fortified products and cosmetic ingredients.
The market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive. Based on annual sales, our main competitors consist of (1) the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers, Givaudan, Firmenich and Symrise, (2) mid-sized companies, (3) numerous local and regional manufacturers and (4) consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the flavors and fragrances sub-market is based on (1) our in-depth understanding of consumers, (2) innovation, arising from the creative skills of our perfumers and flavorists and the technological advances resulting from our research and development activities, (3) our ability to create products which are tailor-made for our customers’ needs, (4) developing strong customer intimacy, (5) driving efficiency in all that we do, (6) quality products, and (7) our broad-based regulatory capabilities.
Large multi-national customers and, increasingly, mid-sized customers, may limit the number of their suppliers by placing some on “core lists,” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products.
To compete more successfully in this environment, we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor our research and development efforts to anticipate customers’ needs, provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists.”
