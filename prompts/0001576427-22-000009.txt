History and Development of the Company
Criteo S.A. was initially incorporated as a société par actions simplifiée, or S.A.S., under the laws of the French Republic on November 3, 2005, for a period of 99 years and subsequently converted to a société anonyme, or S.A. We are registered at the Paris Commerce and Companies Register under the number 484 786 249. Our agent for service of process in the United States ("U.S.") is National Registered Agents, Inc.
Business Overview 
We are a global technology company driving superior commerce outcomes for marketers and media owners through the world’s leading Commerce Media Platform. We operate in commerce media, the future of digital advertising, leveraging commerce data and artificial intelligence ("AI") to connect ecommerce, digital marketing and media monetization to reach consumers throughout their shopping journey. Our vision is to bring richer experiences to every consumer by supporting a fair and open internet that enables discovery, innovation, and choice – powered by trusted and impactful advertising. Since 2018, and accelerating since 2020, we have deeply transformed the Company from a single-product to a multi-solution platform provider, fast diversifying our business into new solutions. 
We enable brands', retailers' and media owners’ growth by providing best-in-class marketing and monetization services and infrastructure on the open Internet, driving approximately $40 billion of commerce outcomes for our customers – in the form of product sales for retailers, brands and marketers and advertising revenues for media owners. We differentiate ourselves by delivering the best performing commerce audiences at scale and we deliver this value by activating commerce data in a privacy-by-design way through proprietary AI technology to reach and engage consumers in real time with highly relevant digital advertisements ("ads") across all stages of the consumer journey. Our data offers deep insights into consumer intent and purchasing habits. 
Our focus is on commerce media. Our clients include many of the largest and most sophisticated consumer brands, commerce companies and media owners in the world. We partner with them to capture user activity on their websites and mobile applications ("apps"), which we define as digital properties, and leverage that data to deliver superior ad performance to help marketers, brands and agencies reach their campaign objectives from top to bottom of the funnel. This includes powering the retail media ecosystem as we enable brands to reach shoppers with relevant ads near the digital point of sale on retailer and marketplace websites while enabling retailers to add a new revenue stream.
Demonstrating the depth and scale of our data, we have exposure to over $1 trillion in online sales transactions on our clients' digital properties in the year ended December 31, 2021. Based on this data and other assets, we activated about $3 billion of media spend on behalf of our customers and delivered 1.8 trillion targeted ads in the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we served approximately 22,000 clients and, in each of the last three years, our average client retention rate, as measured on a quarterly basis, was approximately 90%.
We have established our leading market position in commerce media by focusing on three key assets that differentiate us in the marketplace: actionable commerce data, extensive media access, and world-class predictive AI technology. Our large dataset is uniquely focused on commerce and shoppers, our media access across our broad direct network of media owner partners provides large consumer reach, and our purpose-built AI technology activates this data and media to drive multiple commerce outcomes for our customers. We continuously improve our technology, broaden our reach and leverage and strengthen Criteo’s Buyer Index, a highly differentiated pool of data built through collaboration within our open ecosystem of marketer and media owner customers. Criteo's Buyer Index is one of the world's biggest privacy-compliant data sets focused on shoppers, retailers and brands.
Each day, we are presented with billions of opportunities to connect consumers with relevant advertising messages from our commerce and consumer brand customers in compliance with the highest privacy standards, including the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). For each of these opportunities, our algorithms analyze massive volumes of shopping data to predict consumer preferences and intent, and deliver specific messaging for products or services that are likely to engage that particular consumer. The accuracy of our algorithms improves with every ad we deliver, as they incorporate new data while continuing to learn from prior interactions.
Historically, the legacy Criteo model had focused solely on converting our clients' website visitors into customers, enabling us to charge our clients when users engage with an ad we deliver, usually by clicking on it. This pay-for-performance pricing model clearly links the cost of an advertising campaign to its effectiveness and performance in driving conversions, and continues to be valued as such by our clients. We have since expanded our solutions to address a broader range of marketing and monetization goals for our clients, including audience targeting and brand awareness. We leverage pricing models consistent with industry standards that include cost-per click, cost-per-impression and cost-per-install, as well as volume-based fees for brands and large retailers using our Retail Media solutions, and, in certain cases, a set fee for the use of our platform capabilities.
In May 2021, we acquired Doobe In Site Ltd. ("Mabaya"), a leading retail media technology company that powers sponsored products and retail media monetization for major ecommerce marketplaces globally (the “Mabaya Acquisition”). This acquisition immediately enhanced our retail media capabilities to better meet the unique needs of marketplaces and marketplace sellers.
In December 2021, we executed a purchase agreement to acquire the business of IPONWEB Holding Limited ("IPONWEB"), a market-leading AdTech company with world-class media trading capabilities, for $380 million comprised of a mix of cash and treasury shares of the Company, subject to certain adjustments including for working capital, other current assets and current liabilities and net indebtedness, with the transaction expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 (the "IPONWEB Acquisition"). The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. This strategic acquisition is expected to accelerate our Commerce Media Platform vision by adding scale, complementary products, and stronger first-party data capabilities, further reducing our reliance on third-party cookies and other identifiers.
During 2021, we operated in 96 countries.
Our financial results include:
•Revenue of $2,254.2 million, $2,072.6 million and $2,261.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively;
•Gross profit of $781.9 million, $688.0 million and $829.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively;
•Contribution excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs, or Contribution ex-TAC, previously called Revenue ex-TAC, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $920.8 million, $825.0 million and $946.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively;
•Net income of $137.6 million, $74.7 million and $96.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively; and
•Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $322.5 million, $251.0 million and $299.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliation, included in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Form 10-K for reconciliations from Gross Profit to Contribution ex-TAC and net income to Adjusted EBITDA, in each case the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States or "U.S. GAAP".
Industry Trends
We operate in commerce media, a new approach to advertising at the intersection of ecommerce, digital marketing and media monetization, that uses commerce data and machine learning to reach consumers throughout their shopping journey.
The ability to engage consumers across the various steps of the consumer journey is critical for businesses in the broader commerce and consumer brand sectors, who often dedicate a significant portion of their cost base to developing such an ability. We believe the following trends are relevant in assessing our current and future business.
E-commerce is Booming: According to eMarketer, global retail ecommerce (excluding travel and event tickets and food services) amounted to close to $5 trillion in 2021 or 19% of global retail sales in 2021 and is forecast to represent 23% by 2024, or $7 trillion. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the boom of ecommerce as brands and retailers rapidly transform their ecommerce presence, and gain share from ecommerce giants. As a result of new habits developed by consumers, and as the pandemic has brought in older and less tech-savvy demographics to online shopping, we expect this trend to continue. 81% of online buyers who tried a new retailer indicate that they expect to continue to shop with them in the future, creating a shift in brand loyalty towards open Internet retailers, which today represent approximately 88% of global e-commerce sales done outside of Amazon.
First-Party Data Unlocks Huge Potential: Amazon opened the way in the commerce media category, and other large retailers also leverage their shoppers’ first-party data to drive momentum to their advertising revenue. Many more retailers are now following suit in creating media experiences around their content assets utilizing their first-party data to curate and monetize their audiences. Driving advertising spend to their content requires AdTech and a huge network of shared data.
Trade Marketing Shifts to Digital: Brands have been taking advantage of this surge in ecommerce and accelerating the shift of their trade marketing budgets to online. We believe digital trade marketing represents a market opportunity of approximately $80 billion. This potential of digital trade marketing is feeding growth in the supply of retail media, available for brands to bid on to promote their products directly at the point of sale. A Forrester Research report published in 2020, indicated that 92% of EU brand advertisers say their growth depends on retail media.
Brands, Retailers and Publishers Increasingly Depend on AdTech Partners: As technology quickly evolves in today's highly competitive environment, advertising technology (“AdTech”) becomes increasingly critical for marketers. According to Merkle research published in 2020, 34% of retailers see creating deeper partnerships with technology companies and media platforms as their largest opportunity. Consumers' shopping journeys increasingly remain fragmented across multiple environments, websites, apps, devices, and physical stores, and we believe most marketers increasingly look at diversifying their significant reliance on walled-garden digital advertising partners. Changes in online identity make the environment more complex for both marketers and media owners around addressability and measurement, and require brands and retailers to better leverage AdTech providers to solve these problems for them. The ability for media owners, retailers, brands and agencies to identify users, create and monetize commerce audiences, and drive sales and customer loyalty, today relies on having the right technology partner, able to activate the right data in an efficient way and measure the results in a transparent way across channels. 
Addressable Market
We estimate that the total addressable market for the marketing and monetization services provided by our Commerce Media Platform on the open Internet represents $100 billion in advertising spend that we can activate on behalf of our customers by 2024. In addition, traditional trade marketing dollars used for brick and mortar in-store promotions are rapidly moving to digital, which represents an additional market opportunity of approximately $80 billion. When adding the full potential of online trade marketing our total addressable market reaches $180 to $200 billion.

Criteo's Transformation 
Since 2018, and accelerating since 2020, Criteo has deeply transformed itself from a single-product to a multi-solution platform provider, fast diversifying the business into new solutions.
The Criteo Commerce Media Platform
We have made significant strides in transforming our company to meet the needs of brands, marketers, retailers, and media owners in the evolving commerce landscape. With the Criteo Commerce Media Platform, we offer our marketer and media owner customers a single platform for first-party data-based marketing and monetization, that provides a holistic suite of solutions, powered by AI technology and activates the world’s largest set of commerce data. 
Our technology is optimized to efficiently and effectively drive trusted and impactful business outcomes for our brand, retailer and media owner customers. These include, for example, driving engagement for our customers' brand, shop, app, products and services, driving product sales, driving app installs and consumer visits, driving product consideration from targeted commerce audiences, or driving advertising revenue for media owners and retailers by monetizing their data and audiences with consumer brands.
The Criteo Commerce Media Platform is comprised of:
•Criteo’s large-scale First-Party Media Network
•Criteo’s advanced AI Engine
•Criteo’s powerful solutions: Marketing Solutions and Retail Media
Criteo's solutions work seamlessly across digital devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets), commerce and advertising environments (browsers, apps, connected TV and physical retail stores), platforms and operating systems (Windows, Android, iOS/MacOS), advertising channels and formats (display, including social and native, online video, connected TV and ads on retailers' properties) and media environments (retail media, thousands of direct publishers and mobile app developers in the open Internet, and all major real-time bidding exchanges).
The Criteo Commerce Media Platform is made available as individual products and services as part of our offering.
Criteo First-Party Media Network
Our First-Party Media Network is a component of our Commerce Media Platform and represents the combination of our unique data and media assets. It is the powerful combination of our network of direct relationships with media owners, including retailers, together with our Buyer Index dataset focused on commerce and shoppers that powers Criteo's First-Party Media Network.
Our Data assets: our first-party data-based Buyer Index
Our data assets include privacy-safe insights derived from our customers' proprietary commerce data about their own consumers, such as transaction activity on their digital properties, giving us exposure to over $1 trillion in online sales on a combined basis in 2021, representing approximately 40% of the global retail ecommerce sales excluding China1, or $2.7 billion worth of transactions per day on average.
Through direct integration with our clients' digital properties, we obtain large volumes of consented first-party data, expressed consumer shopping intent and engagement, and transactional data at individual product or service levels, which do not rely on cross-site tracking technologies, such as third-party cookies. The information we collect is anonymized and does not enable us to personally identify any particular consumer.
Our high quality first-party data assets help fuel the accuracy of our algorithms, which improve with the increasing quantity and quality of the data we obtain from our marketer and media owner customers and partners, as well as insights gained through our own extensive operational history. The combination of marketer data, media owner data and proprietary metadata gives us powerful insights into consumer purchasing habits that we use to price media inventory and create relevant ads to drive user engagement and impactful commerce outcomes for our customers. In addition to commerce data at the granular product SKU level, we seek to use as much relevant information as possible about the context and intent of a given user, collected from customers and media owner partners, to further refine our prediction accuracy.

We believe our access to highly granular first-party commerce data validates the trust that our clients place in us. Most of our clients typically provide real-time access to the products or services a visitor has viewed, researched, added to their shopping cart, or bought from them, and continuously receive updated information on over 4 billion products or services across 3,500 product categories, including pricing, images and descriptions. A large number of our clients also provide us with their customers' purchase history data in formats that preserve privacy.
Over the years, we have built data collectives through data pooling among many of our marketer and media owner customers and partners. The combination of these data collectives forms Criteo’s Buyer Index. For each of these data collectives, we ask our clients to grant us the permission to mutualize a significant portion of their proprietary data in an anonymized way with other clients who also contribute data to this collective data pool. With Criteo’s Buyer Index, we have built one of the world's largest and most open data sets focused on shoppers and their commerce activity across retailers and brands, and their activity on media owners’ properties.
The Criteo Buyer Index is comprised of the following data collectives:
•The Identity Graph allows us to match user identifiers provided by clients and publishers across devices and environments, both online and offline. Our algorithms link user identifiers together when they are deemed to belong to the same user. Examples of user identifiers, collected from our customers and partners, and included in the Identity Graph include: hashed customer logins and hashed emails, first-party and third-party cookies, app identifiers such as Apple's IDFA and Android's AAID, in addition to linkages such as LiveRamp's IdentityLink. The graph has billions of identifiers, which we believe cover about 685 million unique Daily Active Users globally, for whom we collect commerce data in real time. In addition, the Identity Graph allows us to leverage offline CRM data of our clients' physical stores to match it with online user profiles, based on their offline shopping history. 
•The Interest Map collects and organizes consumer intent and purchasing data across the products available in our network of commerce clients, in order to build a comprehensive and accurate non-identifying shopper profile for all consumers on whom we have collected data. Our Interest Map applications include the Universal Catalog, which provides category and/or brand enrichment, as well as a unified view of the 4 billion products SKUs, across 3,500 product categories, available across the combined catalogs of our 22,000 commerce clients2. Every day, we have exposure to data on close to $3 billion in online sales on average through 75 million buyer journeys. With the Interest Map, we seek our clients' permission to use their data, on an aggregated and anonymized basis, to power products that are jointly offered to our clients in the collective.
The design and governance of Criteo’s Buyer Index are based on strict and differentiated guiding principles:
•Openness: we commit to a two-way exchange of data with our marketer and media owner customers and partners, whereby all parties contributing data to the collectives, in return for their contribution, benefit from the collective dataset via the Commerce Media Platform, and access cross-device user IDs and relevant Key Performance Indicators to better inform and optimize their advertising with us.
•Transparency: our clients' contribution and sharing of data within the data pools are based on a clear and permission-based usage by Criteo for the mutual benefits of all participants in the data collectives.
•Security: we apply high levels of data security and user privacy standards to the data we hold and manage for ourselves and our clients.
•Fairness: our data collectives are designed and governed in ways such that the value gained by each participant largely exceeds the individual contribution to the collectives, irrespective of the participant’s size.
Consistent with our data minimization principles, our technologies only rely on categories of data that are strictly necessary for the purpose of our services. This means that the user information we collect relates primarily to purchase intent. In addition, we provide consumers with easy-to-use and easy-to-access mechanisms to control their advertising experience and opt out of receiving targeted ads we deliver. This transparent, consumer-centric, and controllable approach to privacy empowers consumers to make better-informed decisions about our use of their data. We also actively encourage our customers and media owner partners to provide transparent and clear information to consumers about our collection and use of data relating to the ads we deliver and monitor.

Our Media assets: our first-party media integrations and media buying scale
We provide our marketer customers with extensive real-time access to advertising inventory through direct relationships with thousands of media owner partners, as well as selective supply side partnerships. We define inventory as the combination of desktop web, mobile web, mobile in-app display, including social and native, online video displays, connected TV, and ad inventory on major retail ecommerce properties, including standard banners, native and sponsored product formats.
In some cases, we have negotiated direct and privileged access with publishers, giving us the opportunity to select, buy and price, on an impression-per-impression basis and in real time: (1) inventory that a publisher might otherwise only sell subject to minimum volume commitments; and/or (2) particular ad impressions before such impressions are made available to other potential buyers. Among their multiple benefits, these direct relationships can give us privileged access to first-party publisher data which allow us to bid on impressions without using third-party cookies or other third-party identifiers. 
Many of our direct publisher partners have granted us preferred access to portions of their inventory as a result of our ability to effectively monetize that inventory. For example, within Criteo Retail Media, we access inventory and first-party data from ecommerce sites that are generally not available to traditional advertising demand. We believe this inventory and data from ecommerce retailers is particularly valuable for consumer brands looking to advertise their products in a multi-brand retail environment.
We price and buy inventory in real time and typically do not pre-buy any impression. In addition, in some instances, we may commit to buying minimum volumes of impressions to certain publishers partners. Across both our direct publisher relationships and inventory purchasing done on Real-Time Bidding (RTB) exchanges, we leverage Criteo AI Engine's ability to quickly and accurately value available advertising inventory, and utilize that information to bid for inventory on a programmatic, automated basis.
Alongside our existing technologies to integrate directly with publishers, we have developed Criteo Direct Bidder, our header-bidding technology. Header-bidding allows publishers to make their inventory simultaneously available for public auction to several competitive bidders, including RTB exchanges. Thanks to our large scale, Criteo Direct Bidder allows us to connect directly to the ad server of publishers in situations where publishers use header bidding to monetize their inventory, allowing us, among other advantages, to bypass RTB exchanges in the bidding process and to save publishers the take-rate RTBs would typically charge them. As a result, Criteo Direct Bidder helps publishers increase the average monetization of their inventory sold through Criteo Direct Bidder, relative to our overall spend through all channels. Using Criteo Direct Bidder, we were connected to publishers globally, on both web and apps, including: IBM Watson Advertising (The Weather Channel), Globo, OLX, NBC, Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, Leboncoin, Daily Mail, Viber, Axel Springer's websites, Marktplaats, M6, AJA Japan and EstSoft. 
We take a variety of brand safety measures to ensure that the brand equity of our clients is preserved at all possible times. These measures include determining that each publisher's inventory meets our content requirements and those of our clients to ensure that their ads are not shown in inappropriate content categories, such as, for example, adult, violent or sensitive political content. In addition, we are an active member of the Coalition for Better Ads, supported by Google, and are compliant with their recommendations for user-friendly advertising formats. In 2020, we entered into a partnership with Oracle Advertising to strengthen our existing brand safety offering. Criteo’s AI Engine is now integrated with Oracle Contextual Intelligence, a solution providing real-time content review and page-level pre-bid classification to clients across 11 standard brand safety categories. In recognition of our efforts to combat fraud and ensure a brand safe digital ecosystem for our advertisers, Criteo has been independently certified by the Trustworthy Accountability Group for the Certification Against Fraud and the Brand Safety Certification.
For Criteo Marketing Solutions, we typically purchase inventory programmatically on a CPM basis from our direct publisher partners and RTBs, through standard terms and conditions for the purchase of advertising inventory. This means that inventory purchased for Criteo Marketing Solutions is paid to the publisher irrespective of whether the user engages, in whatever form, with the advertisement delivered on that publisher's digital property. Pursuant to such arrangements, we purchase impressions for users that Criteo recognizes on these publishers' digital properties. Such arrangements are cancellable upon short notice and without penalty.
For Criteo Retail Media, we historically pay for the inventory of retailer partners based on a revenue share, effectively paying the retailer a portion of the click-based revenue generated by customers clicking on the ads displaying the products of our consumer brand clients. This means that, with these Criteo Retail Media solutions, retailer publishers only get paid if a user effectively clicks on the ad that is displayed on their site. We may also buy inventory on a CPM basis. For our Retail Media Platform (RMP), which represents the majority of our Retail Media Contribution ex-TAC and growing fast, we do not incur our own media cost as retailers use our Retail Media Platform as a technology platform to sell their inventory directly to consumer brands and we bill and collect media cost on their behalf.
We believe that our ability to efficiently access, value and monetize inventory at scale results in a deeply liquid marketplace for both buyers and sellers of advertising, allowing us to deliver effective ads at the right price for our clients, even as the size and complexity of the marketing campaign increases.
Criteo AI Engine 
Criteo AI Engine consists of multiple artificial intelligence algorithms, and the proprietary global hardware and software infrastructure that enables the Commerce Media Platform to operate in real time at significant scale, and activate our commerce datasets and unique media for effective marketing and monetization.
Criteo AI Engine leverages the Buyer Index, with the goal of maximizing consumer engagement to drive impactful business outcomes for clients through the delivery of highly relevant and personalized ads in real time.
Criteo AI Engine consists of:
•Lookalike finder algorithms. These algorithms create user audiences, or groups of consumers likely to be interested in and engage with a specific category of our clients’ products or services, from a predetermined audience seed based on other clients’ audiences that were already targeted and exposed to similar products or services in the context of previous advertising campaigns. Once created, these audiences are used by Criteo AI Engine as targets to reach and be exposed to tailored ads for relevant products or services for the purpose of a dedicated campaign. This set of algorithms typically supports campaign types addressing Audience Targeting objectives, i.e. driving new prospects to consider brands, products or services with which they have not yet engaged in the past.
•Recommendation algorithms. These algorithms create ads tailored to specific consumer interest and intent by determining the specific products or services to include in the ad. These products and services may be ones that the consumer has already been exposed to, or that the algorithms predict the customer could be interested in. Alternatively, these may be products and services that other consumers within Criteo Buyer Index have been interested in. 
•Dynamic Creative Optimization+ (DCO+). Based on the results of our dynamic creative algorithms, Criteo AI Engine automatically and dynamically assembles customized creative ad content on an impression-per-impression basis in real time, by optimizing each individual creative component in the ad, from the font, color, size and format of product images to the "call to action" or price discount. Our patented Dynamic Creative Optimization+ technology offers virtually unlimited personalization, with up to 17 trillion visual ad variations, without the need to define ad sizes or layouts upfront, while always maintaining the consistency of our clients' brand image.
•Predictive bidding algorithms. These algorithms predict the probability and nature of a user's engagement with a given ad. Such predicted user engagement can take the form of, for example, customer site visits, clicks, conversions, shopping basket value, specific product categories purchased, or even the gross margin of the purchased product or service that our client generates from such purchase. This prediction of engagement incorporates data from our marketer customers, our media owner customers and partners, including user intent, who our customer is, the products offered in the ad, as well as data on the creative content of the ad and the media context in which the ad is displayed, as well as third-party sources. Together with our recommendation algorithms, the prediction algorithms allow us to determine the most appropriate price to pay for an ad impression, based on an individual user's predicted engagement, what our customer is willing to pay for that engagement, as well as Criteo's own target margin (or economic "take rate" retained by Criteo) from placing that individual ad. Our bidding engine executes campaigns based on certain objectives set by our clients (such as cost-per-click, cost-per-order, cost-of-sales, cost-per-visit, cost-per-impression, cost-per-install or total campaign budget). After a bid for an ad impression is placed and won, Criteo AI Engine assembles and delivers individualized ads, and provides campaign reporting in near-real time.
•Software systems and processes. Our algorithms are supported by robust software infrastructure that allows us to operate seamlessly at a large scale through our network of more than 45,000 servers as of the end of 2021. The architecture and processing capabilities of this technology have been designed to match the massive computational demands and complexity of our algorithms in real time. This technology enables data synchronization, storage and analysis across a large-scale distributed computing infrastructure in multiple geographies, as well as fast data collection and retrieval using multi-layered caching infrastructure.
•Experimentation platform. Our Research & Development team continuously tunes Criteo AI Engine via experimentation and A/B tests. For example, in 2021, we performed about 800 online A/B tests and over 100,000 offline experiments and tests. We use an online/offline testing platform to improve the capabilities and effectiveness of our prediction models by measuring the correlation of specific parameters with user engagement, usually measured by consumer visits, clicks and conversions, typically in the form of sales. A dedicated team is constantly testing new types and sources of data, as well as new variables, to determine whether they help diminish the gap between, for example, predicted visits, click-throughs and conversions, and actual visits, click-throughs and conversions over the course of a live campaign.
A key attribute of Criteo AI Engine is the vast metadata of learnings on marketing and commerce effectiveness that we have accumulated from having delivered and measured responses to close to 11 trillion advertising impressions since our Company's inception. 
We have long established and adopted Privacy-by-design as a central element of our technology and product design and development cycles, with a strong commitment to ensuring best practices in privacy, security and safety for consumers and our marketer and media owner customers. Since 2013, we have had a designated Data Privacy Officer along with a team of privacy experts. These experts are integrated within our R&D and Product organizations and processes, and consider all facets of user privacy as key elements in the design of any new technology, solution or feature of the Commerce Media Platform. They also perform ongoing Privacy Impact Assessments to monitor potential risks during the product lifecycle and proactively mitigate those risks. The Data Privacy team delivers company-wide privacy training, enforces our privacy policies and is integral to ensuring that we build the best solutions and services. We regularly review and document our internal privacy policies, amend existing policies as necessary and enforce these policies with our clients, media owner partners and vendors.
Our Solutions
Criteo reports its business results for two operating and reportable segments: Marketing Solutions and Retail Media.
•Criteo Marketing Solutions allow commerce companies to engage consumers with personalized ads across the full marketing funnel, leveraging online and offline store data.
◦Examples of expected business outcomes driven by Criteo Marketing Solutions include:
▪Awareness: creating and building brand awareness for a client's existing or new product or service, by targeting relevant high-quality consumer audiences showing intent for that particular product or service and reaching these audiences, for example, through online video ads across the breadth of our premium publisher network on the open Internet;
▪Audience Targeting: driving visits from new prospects on the website of our clients, or driving installations of our clients' apps by new consumers, by engaging such prospect visitors online (either on the web, in apps or on connected TV), with personalized ads offering products or services tailored to their predicted interest through our audience targeting capabilities, based on our Buying Index data and/or contextual signals;
▪Conversion: driving sales for commerce clients by engaging consumers online, with personalized ads offering products or services for which they have already expressed shopping intent; or driving more sales from existing customers of our commerce clients, by accurately targeting and re-engaging these existing customers online with personalized ads offering new products or services that they have not yet purchased nor been exposed to.
◦Our clients' use and consumption of Criteo Marketing Solutions is made flexible through a set of tools and services:
▪Our clients have access to an integrated self-service customer interface, called the Management Center, providing transparency, control and visibility over their marketing investments and campaigns with us, whatever their business and marketing goals may be. This interface enables the flexible and modular consumption of our various solutions directly by our clients, as well as the execution and management of their campaigns through a suite of software and services that automates key campaign processes, and a high level of control over the objectives, parameters and performance of their various campaigns with us. Criteo Management Center reduces unnecessary complexity and cost associated with manual processes of having to use multiple Demand-Side Platforms ("DSPs") and sources of inventory supply, delivering efficiencies across the marketing funnel, even as campaigns grow in size, complexity and mix of marketing goals. 
▪In addition to self-service access to Criteo Management Center, we also offer a managed-service approach to our larger clients, providing deep business intelligence and analytics services. Our teams of advisers aid our larger customers in setting goals for, extracting insights from, and evaluating trends and performance of their various advertising campaigns with us across multiple marketing goals, sources of inventory, advertising channels and formats, and the multiple digital devices that consumers may use.
▪In addition, we offer multiple API integrations for certain partners and clients to enable the management of our clients' advertising investments with us in a unified and integrated way with some of their other advertising or marketing technology partners which makes Criteo solutions directly available in their back-office.
▪In parallel with accessing transparent reporting and measurement from Criteo Management Center, a large proportion of our clients regularly use their own attribution tools and solutions from third-party vendors (such as, for example, Nielsen’s Digital Ad Ratings, Google Analytics, IBM Coremetrics or Adobe Analytics) to independently measure and assess the performance of the results that Criteo delivers, including visits, sales and other key metrics.
In Marketing Solutions, our new solutions are focused on the following areas:
•Brand awareness: We are extending our offering to allow for more brand awareness campaigns for both brands and retailers on the open Internet, including in online video formats and through the Connected TV channel.
•Audience-first Targeting: We already address customer acquisition as a marketing objective and intend to continue growing it, along with similar use cases building on audiences based on our shopper data. In addition, we are investing resources in enhancing the efficacy and impact of cohort advertising on our ecosystem and help shape the end solution which will replace third-party cookies in the Google Chrome browser environment.
•Contextual advertising: We are also developing new solutions for contextual advertising to accompany our clients in the fast-changing identity landscape. We believe our approach to contextual advertising is different from what currently exists in the market as we are using first-party data to add a commerce “signature” to the content consumers are reading and watching across the Open Internet. This enables us to go beyond traditional contextual inferences of interest and intent to indicate what combinations of content are actually driving purchases.
•Omnichannel: We are fast growing our Omnichannel capabilities that help bridge offline consumer identities and shopping habits with ecommerce and online shopping. While a large portion of our commerce client base operates physical stores and still generates a significant percentage of their sales from these stores, extracting massive amounts of sales data from their physical stores, they often lack the sophisticated technology necessary to activate this dataset for sales generation, both online and offline. As a result, retailers are increasingly interested in accessing a set of differentiated omnichannel advertising solutions that allow them to target their customers everywhere they are and bridge the gap between online and offline. We believe our Omnichannel offering is highly differentiated compared to traditional digital advertising players in the marketplace. We intend to further expand our solutions for omnichannel advertising, including by feeding our clients' offline CRM data into our Identity Graph, in order to further grow the match rate of offline consumers with their online profile.
•Criteo Retail Media assists retailers in generating high-margin advertising revenues from consumer brands looking to address multiple marketing goals, and to drive sales for themselves, by monetizing their audiences through personalized ads, either on their own digital store or on media owner properties on the open Internet.
◦Examples of expected business outcomes driven by Criteo Retail Media include:
▪generating advertising revenue for retailers on their online store, by providing retailers with self-service access to our technology platform for them to monetize their commerce data, traffic and audiences directly with consumer brands across various marketing goals;
▪driving sales for consumer brand clients on the site of retailer partners, by connecting consumer brands and retailers and engaging consumers on the retailer's digital property with personalized ads offering specific brand products available on the retailer's digital store and for which consumers have expressed interest (also called "onsite");
▪driving sales for consumer brand clients on the site of retailer partners, by connecting consumer brands and retailers and engaging consumers outside of the retailer property on the open Internet with personalized ads offering specific brand products available on the retailer's digital store and for which consumers have expressed interest (also called "offsite");
◦Our retailer and brand customers respectively manage their Retail Media revenues and budgets using a self-service interface called the Retail Media Platform. The Retail Media Platform provides flexible pricing options to brands: guaranteed placement (cost-per-impression) and auction-based (cost-per-click). We charge retailers a negotiated supply-side platform fee and sometimes a technology fee, while brands pay us a negotiated demand-side platform fee. In addition, we may charge brands a managed-service fee and other fees for accessing additional insights.
In 2021, Criteo Retail Media accounted for more than 10% of our total consolidated revenue.
We believe Criteo Retail Media is a particularly differentiated offering in the marketplace with significant potential opportunities. We will continue to roll out the Retail Media Platform to new markets and move all our Retail Media campaigns to the platform, making the digital stores of large retailers a key advertising channel to generate high gross margin revenue from consumer brands. In addition, we intend to grow the number of retailers we work with in the U.S. and Europe, deepen our share of wallets with existing retailer and brand customers, accelerate our geographic expansion in Europe and enter new markets in the APAC region, grow our offsite advertising capabilities for brands across our premium publisher network on the open Internet, grow Retail Media for retailer marketplaces, bring more commerce insights to brands as a key value-added service and provide brands with an integrated view on the Retail Media spend on Walled Garden retailers.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the Commerce Media Platform is transforming digital marketing and media monetization for our customers. We enable brands' and retailers' growth by making their marketing and monetization efforts more efficient, effective and measurable by driving trusted and impactful business outcomes across multiple marketing goals. We believe the following competitive strengths, supported by our first-mover advantage, have enabled us and will continue to enable us to capture a significant share of our commerce media opportunity:
Shopper Data. Our First Party Media Network leverages massive amounts of granular first-party data focused on commerce and shopping behaviors, through data sharing among our clients. With an estimated 685 million unique Daily Active Users in our Identity Graph, we are building one of the largest data sets focused on shoppers, with a scope and scale among the largest in the industry. Close to $3 billion worth of daily transactions across 4 billion product SKUs from 3,500 product categories are incorporated into our graph, allowing us to analyze about 75 million daily buyer journeys. Our Buyer Index offers a comprehensive, accurate and non-identifying shopper profile for all consumers on whom we have collected information, and is the foundation for the development of compelling advertising solutions - existing and new - that help our customers span the full marketing funnel across brand awareness, audience targeting and conversion marketing goals.
Consumer Reach, Scale and Network Effects. Our large and loyal base of customers and first-party media owner partners provide for stability and positive network effects. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 22,000 clients, including some of the largest ecommerce companies in the world, and our client retention rate was approximately 90%. In parallel, as of the same date, we were working with direct publishers on both web and apps, in addition to all of our large global and local RTB partners. These direct integrations on both the demand and supply sides ensure privacy-compliant access to first-party data, shielding from the consequences of third-party cookie limitations. As we continue to grow our client base, we continue to grow the number of users who interact with our ads, increasing our consumer reach and allowing us to benefit from greater scale when buying inventory from publisher partners, many of whom have granted us preferred access to portions of their advertising inventory. Beyond the stability in our business that our large and loyal base of customers and media owner partners provides us, significant opportunities exist to cross-sell and up-sell our product portfolio within our large existing customer base. As clients spend more with us and we attract more media inventory and deliver more ads, our data assets grow, enabling us to deliver even more precisely targeted and personalized ads and generate a greater impact for our customers, both marketers and media owners. As a result, we believe more brands, commerce marketers and media owners may use our offering and potentially increase their spend with us. This, in turn, may enable us to increase monetization for media owners and retailers, further expanding our media network and enhancing our ability to drive performance for all customers. This cycle of self-reinforcing network effects, based on our large scale and loyal base of marketer and media owner customers and partners, may continue to fuel our business in the future.
Retail Media. Our Retail Media offering provides unique opportunities to both brands and retailers. Our Retail Media value proposition, helping retailers to monetize their data and inventory with brands, is quite unique in the marketplace outside of Amazon. It provides opportunities for brands to advertise on retailers' on-site media, while creating a new source of profitable revenues for large retailers. With the acquisition of Mabaya in 2021, we have also enhanced our retail media capabilities to best meet the unique needs of marketplaces and marketplace sellers. Criteo's Retail Media Platform is the industry's first self-service and transparent software providing an easy way for brands to manage their online marketing budgets to drive immediate, measurable commerce outcome directly where shoppers search and buy their products. We enable brands, agencies, and multiple retailers to buy and sell retail media using a common platform, thus benefiting from meaningful network effects due to our unique position as the technology supporting a multi-retailer ecosystem, whereas most competitors in the retail media space focus on supporting siloed retailer Walled Gardens. Brands and their agencies use our platform to access unique inventory at meaningful scale, and retailers get access to brand marketing budgets at a scale they would not be able to access on their own. This creates a network effect where the value for customers only increases as more brand and retailer participants join the ecosystem. In addition, our deep technical integrations with retailers, requiring meaningful engineering investment from the retailer, make us very sticky with them and enable us to offer preferred or exclusive inventory to brands and agencies, as well as a superior shopper experience to consumers. We primarily use a server-side technology to integrate our platform with retailer sites and apps. In addition, we require multi-year commitments and product ads exclusivity as part of our standard retailer services agreements. Both our unique inventory access and increasingly deep technical integrations with other advertising technology and reporting platforms provide defensible relationships with brands and agencies. For example, our API partner program embeds our technology into ad platforms that brands and agencies already use to buy search, social, and other large platforms' ad inventory. Additionally, with many major brand and agency clients, we directly connect our reporting data directly into client analytics and reporting platforms via our APIs.
Superior Insights and Measurement. We believe we have superior capabilities for Commerce Insights and measurement. Our technology provides our clients with the unique ability to measure against product sales at the product SKU level. For example, our commerce insights can bring together organic shopping data with paid media metrics for brands.
Scaled Global Presence. We do business in 96 countries and have a direct operating presence through 29 offices in 15 countries. We have achieved this global presence by replicating and scaling our effective business model across all geographic markets. Large businesses are increasingly seeking global advertising partners able to provide comprehensive offerings that are effective across multiple geographies. We believe we are able to meet this demand by leveraging our scalable AI technology and global network of relationships and are well positioned to serve our clients in virtually every market in which they seek to drive trusted, impactful and measurable business results and commerce outcomes.
Strong Financial Model. Our profitable, cash-generative financial model allows us to invest for growth while maintaining healthy profitability. Our company has a sustainable, robust profitability margin. In the year ended December 31, 2021, our operating profit margin was 6.7% of revenue and our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Contribution ex-TAC was 35%. In addition, we manage our expense base in a disciplined way and focus on driving productivity through operational excellence and automation across the organization. Productivity and efficiency gains enable us to reinvest into strategic growth areas, while maintaining healthy profitability, with the goal to driving Adjusted EBITDA of 32% of Contribution ex-TAC or above. Our financial model generates a sustainable and significant amount of free cash flow. In 2021, net cash flows provided by operating activities were $220.9 million and consisted of net income of $137.6 million, $124.9 million in adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items and $(41.6) million of cash flows used for working capital. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated free cash flow of $167.9 million. In addition, our company maintained a strong cash position of $515.5 million at the end of fiscal 2021, which, together with marketable securities and our Revolving Credit Facility, provides for financial liquidity of about $967 million, offering flexibility for executing on our strategic roadmap. We believe having a profitable, cash-generative financial model providing for financial flexibility and investment capacity is a strong competitive advantage, in particular compared to multiple sub-scale companies in our industry.
Our Business & Growth Opportunities 
Our mission is to power the world's marketers and media owners with trusted and impactful advertising. We enable our customers’ business growth through commerce media, by providing best-in-class marketing and monetization services and driving measurable business outcomes at scale. As described throughout, our vision is to bring richer experiences to every consumer by supporting a fair and open internet that enables discovery, innovation, and choice – powered by trusted and impactful advertising for the world’s marketers and media owners. 
As part of our transformation, we have expanded our business through several opportunities, both within our existing suite of solutions and in new areas, always focused on driving trusted and impactful business outcomes for clients. Our overarching priority is to drive sustainable and profitable growth for our business. This involves increasing our focus even more on the fast-growing ecommerce space and broadening our value proposition to cover all commerce media marketing goals on our single Commerce Media Platform in a holistic way, while always driving measurable business outcomes to our marketer and media owner customers, including sales. In parallel, we are focused on investing into our strategic growth priorities and self-funding for these investments by driving efficiency across the organization. 
While our strategic priorities focus on the three key areas of integration, differentiation and scale, the core elements of our broader business strategy include:
Strengthen the Core. We continuously strengthen our retargeting product, aimed at converting our clients' customers in both the web and apps. We intend to achieve this by leveraging our strong differentiators, including around Criteo Buyer Index and user identification thanks to our first-party media network, continuously improving Criteo's AI Engine technology and the strong performance of our core product in all environments, providing more transparency on our value proposition, and adding new clients and media owner partners. We are also adding multiple capabilities, like third-party measurement, through industry partnerships to enhance our core solution.
Over the past four years, the growth of retargeting has been slowing down and turned negative in 2019 and 2020, before stabilizing in 2021 despite incremental privacy headwinds. Over this period, cookie restrictions on several browsers have had a significant negative impact on our business on the web, including on retargeting. The COVID-19 pandemic was an additional headwind to this business in 2020 and continued to impact our clients in the Travel and Classifieds verticals in 2021. Beyond these headwinds, retargeting has proven resilient and continued to grow in the Retail vertical, which is central to our business.
We are taking several measures as part of our strategy to stabilize our retargeting business over time, including: 
•Maintaining a high level of preferred direct relationships with media owners, allowing us to grow our first-party media network and reduce our exposure to third-party cookies. We expect to continue to expand our first-party media network, sheltered from cookie restriction, including by increasing the deployment of Criteo Direct Bidder with large publishers, both on the web and on mobile apps, as well as by leveraging our Supply-Side Platform, including through the pending acquisition of IPONWEB;
•Encouraging our clients and publishers to adopt OpenPass, our open-sourced identity framework dedicated to digital advertising and respectful of users' privacy, providing a replacement to third-party cookie bearing users' consent;
•Growing our capabilities as a differentiated Demand-Side-Platform specifically for commerce, including for upper-funnel marketing on top of our strengths in lower funnel, offering more flexibility throughout the stack, and adjusting our pricing model to increase the transparency of our value proposition for our core product;
•Further expanding our global client base across customer categories. We have a track-record of entering new geographic markets, adding new clients successfully and rapidly gaining commercial traction. We intend to continue to grow our client base across the Strategic, Core and Tail customer categories. We believe opportunities also remain to grow our business with large customers in markets where we already operate, including in Western Europe, the U.S. and Japan; and
•Providing even more transparency and control to advertisers and their agencies through our self-service platform.
Expand Our Product Portfolio. We intend to continue to leverage our existing assets to diversify and strengthen our business outside of retargeting, continue to build and expand our suite of fast-growing marketing and monetization solutions, and build further competitive moats around our core assets.
In fiscal year 2021, our non-retargeting solutions already represented close to 30% of our total business, as measured on a Contribution ex-TAC basis, including 32% in the fourth quarter 2021. We are investing in the growth of these non-retargeting solutions and expect them to represent close to 40% of our overall business in 2022, including the pending acquisition of IPONWEB.
Explore Strategic Game Changers. We look for opportunities to extend and accelerate the growth of our business by exploring and bringing strategic assets and capabilities through partnerships and M&A, in addition to executing organically.
For example, in 2021, we entered and expanded a number of partnerships.
•We migrated our partners to the new and improved Criteo API framework and launched the Criteo Partner Marketplace, an app marketplace that empowers our partner solutions to be discovered by our global customer base;
•We built a Criteo destination within the Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) to enable advertisers to onboard first party data;
•We implemented the capability to bid natively on incremental traffic from auctions with Liveramp’s RampID pseudonymous identifier;
•We built pipelines to receive the European Foundation’s netID single sign-on;
•We formed a strategic partnership with Bluecore, to provide Criteo advertisers access to Bluecore’s predictive audience capabilities to engage key shoppers through performance display across the open web;
•We extended our relationship with Oracle Advertising to leverage Oracle Contextual Intelligence, a solution providing real-time content review and pre-bid classification to clients across brand-suitable categories as we continue to scale their tools for brand safety across joint clients.
In the future, we intend to continue to collaborate with existing and new industry partners to extend the capabilities and functionalities of the Criteo Commerce Media Platform, beyond what we currently offer on a standalone basis. This may include partnerships with other Demand-Side-Platforms and other ecosystem players to extend our customer reach to new client categories or agencies. In addition, we may look at further expanding our access to video inventory, both in the Web and mobile apps, as well as extending our access to Connected TV inventory on a much larger scale.
We continue to evaluate and execute on M&A transactions, with a critical assessment on technologies and businesses that have the potential to accelerate our Commerce Media Platform strategy by enhancing, complementing or expanding our strategic capabilities, including our technology, our marketing and monetization solutions, go-to-market, or R&D team. We target acquisitions that, over time, can be efficiently integrated into the Criteo Commerce Media Platform, including into our AI technology, global operations and company culture, while preserving the quality and performance of our offering. Key criteria for acquisitions include demonstrated revenue traction and a proven value proposition for clients and partners and are easy to integrate. We believe our entrepreneurial culture, growth opportunity, global scale, financial profile, strong brand and market position enable us to be an attractive acquirer. 
•In May 2021, we acquired Mabaya, a leading retail media technology company that powers sponsored products and retail media monetization for major ecommerce marketplaces globally. The Mabaya Acquisition immediately enhanced our retail media capabilities to better meet the unique needs of marketplaces and marketplace sellers;
•In December 2021, we executed a purchase agreement to acquire IPONWEB, a market-leading AdTech company with world-class media trading capabilities, for $380 million comprised of a mix of cash and treasury shares of the Company, subject to certain adjustments including for working capital, other current assets and current liabilities and net indebtedness, with the transaction expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. The IPONWEB Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions. This strategic acquisition is expected to accelerate our Commerce Media Platform vision by adding scale, complementary products, and stronger first-party data capabilities, further reducing our reliance on third-party cookies and other identifiers.
Drive Technology and Operations Excellence. We take a portfolio management approach to managing our business, organization and expense base: right-sizing or streamlining the parts of the business with stabilizing revenue in order to enable investments on the growing parts of our business into technology innovation and other strategic priorities. We intend to continue to invest in growing our business, while driving productivity and efficiency gains through operational excellence across the company and maintaining healthy profitability. We believe these investments will feed the long-term sustainable growth of Criteo. We intend to continue to make investments in our technology innovation and new product development, including in Retail Media, our first-party media network, Contextual advertising, online video, Connected TV and Commerce Insights. We expect these investments to further strengthen our Commerce Media Platform. Driving operational excellence through the company to self-fund for our investments involves increasing automation and the scalability of our operations. 
Infrastructure
Our ability to execute depends on our highly sophisticated global technology software and hardware infrastructure. As of December 31, 2021, our global infrastructure included over 40,000 servers through a global network of eleven data centers, including one Hadoop cluster, that comprise to 3,000 servers hosting 800,000 processing cores, providing a storage capacity exceeding 624,000 terabytes and 6,590 terabytes of random-access memory. Our global infrastructure is divided into three independent geographic areas in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA. In each of these geographic areas, our services are delivered through data centers that support this particular area. We generally rely on more than one data center in any given geographic area. Within large areas, the data centers are strategically placed to be close to our clients, publishers and users. This provides the benefit of minimizing the impact of network latency within a particular geographic area, especially for time-constrained services such as RTB. In addition, we replicate data across multiple data centers to maximize availability and performance. We also generally seek to distribute workload across multiple locations to avoid overloads in our systems and increase reliability through redundancy. In addition, we consider sustainability factors as we evaluate our infrastructure footprint, including prioritizing resource efficiency and clean energy to operate sustainable data centers.
Within each data center, computing power is provided by horizontal build-outs of commodity servers arranged in multiple, highly redundant pools. Some of these pools are dedicated to handling incoming traffic and delivering ads while others are devoted to the data analytics involved in creating our ads. In particular, we use software specifically designed for processing large data sets, such as Hadoop, to run offline data analyzes and to train our AI and Machine Learning models. The results are then fed back to refresh and improve our prediction and recommendation algorithms.
We use multiple-layered security controls to protect Criteo AI Engine and our data assets, including hardware- and software-based access controls for our source code and production systems, segregated networks for different components of our production systems and centralized production systems management.
Our Clients 
Our client base for Criteo Marketing Solutions consists primarily of companies in the retail, travel and classifieds verticals, which we refer to as "commerce companies" or "commerce clients", and includes some of the largest and most sophisticated commerce companies in the world. These companies range from large, global, diversified commerce companies to mid-sized regional companies. With Criteo Retail Media, we also serve consumer brand manufacturers, which we refer to as "consumer brands" or "consumer brand clients". As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 22,000 clients (both commerce and consumer brand clients combined).
At the end 2021, approximately 70% of our client relationships were held directly with the client and the remaining 30% with advertising agencies or other third-parties on the Criteo Marketing Solutions side of the business, whereas 50% of our Criteo Retail Media revenue comes from agencies.
We believe our business is not substantially dependent on any particular client or group of clients. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, our largest client represented 7.0%, 3.5% and 2.8% of our revenue, respectively, and in 2021, 2020 and 2019, our largest 10 clients represented 16.6%, 13.7% and 11.4% of our revenue in the aggregate, respectively. 
There is no group of customers under common control or customers that are affiliates of each other constituting an aggregate amount equal to 10% or more of our consolidated revenues, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on Criteo.
We define a client to be a unique party from whom we have received a signed contract or an insertion order and for whom we have delivered an advertisement or monetized an advertising inventory during the previous 12 months. We count specific brands or divisions within the same business as distinct clients so long as those entities have separately signed insertion orders with us. In the case of some solutions within Criteo Retail Media, we count the parent company of the brands as an individual client, even if several distinct brands pertaining to the same parent company have signed separate contracts or insertion orders with us. On the other hand, we count a client who runs campaigns in multiple geographies as a single client, even though multiple insertion orders may be involved. When the insertion order is with an advertising agency, we generally consider the client on whose behalf the advertising campaign is conducted as the “client” for purposes of this calculation. In the event a client has its advertising spend with us managed by multiple agencies, that client is counted as a single client.
Our client base is composed of three client categories: the Strategic client category, the Core client category and the Tail client category. Each client category is serviced through a combination of direct and indirect approaches, including through brand agencies, performance agencies and resellers for the Strategic, Core and Tail categories respectively. While Criteo historically focused on serving both large (Strategic and Core) and midmarket clients (midmarket being the prior name of Tail clients), our client strategy now focuses more heavily on serving the Strategic and Core categories through the full breadth of our Commerce Media Platform and therefore places less emphasis on serving Tail clients.
Research and Development 
We invest substantial resources in research and development to conduct fundamental research on artificial intelligence, machine-learning models, enhance the algorithms in Criteo AI Engine, develop new features and solutions, conduct quality assurance testing, improve our core technology and enhance our technology infrastructure. Our engineering group is primarily located in research and development centers in Paris, France, Grenoble, France and Ann Arbor, Michigan. With the expected acquisition of IPONWEB, we will expand our R&D engineering centers to include Berlin, Germany, and Moscow, Russia. We expect to continue to expand capabilities of our technology in the future and to invest significantly in continued research and development and new solutions efforts. We had 682 employees primarily engaged Research and Development and Product as of December 31, 2021. Research and development expenses, including expenses related to the Product group, totaled $151.8 million, $132.5 million and $172.6 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Intellectual Property 
Our intellectual property rights are a key component of our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. We generally require employees, consultants, clients, publishers, suppliers and partners to execute confidentiality agreements with us that restrict the disclosure of our intellectual property. We also generally require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights.
Intellectual property laws, together with our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of France and the U.S. and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.
Agreements with our employees and consultants may also be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies to address any breach. Further, to the extent that our employees or consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights to know-how and inventions relating thereto or resulting therefrom. Finally, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the Criteo Commerce Media Platform or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
As of December 31, 2021, we held 17 patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign counterparts, and had filed 13 non-provisional patent applications in the U.S. and Europe. We also own and use registered and unregistered trademarks on or in connection with our products and services in numerous jurisdictions. In addition, we have also registered numerous internet domain names.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the technology industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, have asserted and may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our clients or our publishers. Litigation and associated expenses may be necessary to enforce our proprietary rights.
Privacy, Data Protection and Content Control
Legal and Regulatory
Privacy and data protection laws play a significant role in our business. The regulatory environment for the collection and use of consumer data by advertising networks, advertisers and publishers is frequently evolving in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. The U.S. and foreign governments have enacted, considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants’ ability to collect, augment, analyze, use and share personal data, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can utilize cookies or other tracking technologies.
In the U.S., at both the federal and state level, there are laws that govern activities such as the collection and use of data by companies like us. At the federal level, online advertising activities in the U.S. have primarily been subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, which has regularly relied upon Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or Section 5, to enforce against unfair and deceptive trade practices, including alleged violations of consumer privacy interests. Various states have also enacted legislation that governs these practices. For example, on September 27, 2013, the governor of California signed into law AB 370, an amendment to the California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003, or CalOPPA. This amendment requires that we disclose in our privacy policy how we respond to web browser "do not track" signals. Our current privacy policy discloses that we do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals but that we do respond to opt-out requests made through our proprietary opt-out button or through industry opt-out platforms (namely Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance). However, the U.S. privacy law framework may be subject to significant evolutions in the near future both at a federal and at a state level. At a federal level, lawmakers are currently considering the possibility of adopting a federal privacy law. In 2018, the State of California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA. The CCPA has been characterized as the first “GDPR-like” privacy statute to be enacted in the U.S. because its scope, and a number of the key provisions, resemble the GDPR. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by, among other requirements, creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of personal data from minors, creating new notice obligations and new limits on the sale of personal information, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. As currently enacted, we and partners in our industry have been required to comply with these requirements since January 1, 2020, when the CCPA became effective. As with GDPR, the advertising technology marketplace may have to adapt to operating under the CCPA where it applies. Our advertising or publishing partners may impose new CCPA restrictions with which we must adapt and comply. This past November, the voters in California voted to pass the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), an Act that both amends and expands the scope of the CCPA. The CPRA will become effective on January 1, 2023, with a look back period to January 1, 2022. The CPRA creates new criteria by which businesses can be regulated, expands the definition of “personal information” to more closely match Europe, a new audit requirement, and the creation of an agency to oversee enforcement of the CPRA. The CPRA also explicitly provides an opt-out right for cross-contextual behavioral advertising. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this adaptation or the effect on our business. Adapting our business to the CCPA and the forthcoming new requirements under the CPRA could involve substantial resources and expense, and may cause us to divert resources from other aspects of our business, all of which may adversely affect our business.
In addition, the Criteo Commerce Media Platform reaches users throughout the world, including in Europe, Australia, Canada, South America and Asia-Pacific. As a result, some of our activities may also be subject to the laws of foreign jurisdictions. In particular, data protection laws in Europe can be more restrictive regarding the collection and use of data than those in U.S. jurisdictions.
In the European Union, the two main pillars of the data protection legal framework are the E-Privacy Directive (Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was implemented in May 2018.
The E-Privacy Directive directs EU member states to ensure that accessing information on an Internet user’s computer, such as through a cookie and other similar technologies, is allowed only if the Internet user has been informed about such access and given his or her consent. A recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union clarified that such consent must be reflected by an affirmative act of the user, and European regulators are increasingly agitating for more robust forms of consent. These developments may result in decreased reliance on implied consent mechanisms that have been used to meet requirements of the E-Privacy Directive in some markets. A replacement for the E-Privacy Directive is currently under discussion by EU member states to complement and bring electronic communication services in line with the GDPR and force a harmonized approach across EU member states. It is possible that the proposed e-privacy regulation could further raise the bar for the use of cookies and the fines and penalties for breach could be significant.
In December 2016, the EU institutions reached an agreement on the GDPR. The GDPR has updated principles drawn from the 1995 Data Protection Directive while imposing new levels of sanctions for non-compliance. The EU data protection authorities have also been granted power to impose administrative fines of up to a maximum of €20 million or 4% of the data controller's or data processor's global turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. 
We believe that the regulation has no material impact on our business or the way our technologies operate. However, GDPR is still a relatively recent regulation with no established case law. Therefore interpretations of the GDPR may vary, especially with respect to the articulation between GDPR (lex generali) and E-Privacy Directive (lex speciali) and the conditions for the collection of a valid "cookie" consent, and thus there can be no assurance that this will not have any particular impact on our business, technologies or practices in the medium to long term. 
Further, on October 1, 2020, the French data protection authority (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés, or CNIL) issued the final version of its guidelines on the use of cookies and other trackers and its final recommendations on modalities for obtaining users’ consent to store or read non-essential cookies and similar technologies on their devices. The recommendations provide that, when required, consent must be indicated by a clear and positive action of the data subject, such as by clicking on an “accept all” button on the first layer of the consent management platform. CNIL also noted that it should be as easy to refuse consent to the use of cookies as it is to accept consent, and a “refuse all” button should be present on the first layer of the consent management platform, equivalent to the “accept all” button in terms of size, position and color. Further, the ability to withdraw consent must be readily available at all times. The recommendations are not binding, nor are they intended to be prescriptive and exhaustive. Companies had until March 2021 to ensure compliance with these guidelines, and CNIL is currently auditing many websites in France to verify if they comply with its guidelines.
As we continue to expand into other foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.
Self-Regulation
In addition to complying with extensive government regulations, we voluntarily and actively participate in several trade associations and industry self-regulatory groups that promulgate best practices or codes of conduct relating to targeted advertising. For example, the Internet Advertising Bureau EU & US, the Network Advertising Initiative, the European Digital Advertising Alliance and the Digital Advertising Alliance have developed and implemented guidance for companies to provide notice and choice to users regarding targeted advertising.
We also provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising, and allow them to opt out from the use of such data for the delivery of targeted advertising. In an effort to harmonize the industry’s approach to internet-based advertising, these programs facilitate a user's ability to disable services of integrated providers, but also educate users on the potential benefits of online advertising, including access to free content and display of more relevant advertisements to them. The rules and policies of the self-regulatory programs that we participate in are updated from time to time and may impose additional restrictions upon us in the future.
Criteo became one of the first companies to broadly include an "Ad Choices" link in all the advertisements we deliver, which gives users access to clear, transparent, detailed and user-friendly information about personalized advertisements and the data practices associated with the advertisements they receive. In addition, we provide consumers with an easy-to-use and easy-to-access mechanism to control their advertising experience and opt out of receiving targeted advertisements we deliver.
We believe that this transparent consumer-centric approach to privacy empowers consumers to make better-informed decisions about our use of their data. We also actively encourage our clients and publishers to provide information to consumers about our collection and use of data relating to the advertisements we deliver and monitor.
Content Control and Brand Safety 
To protect against unlawful advertiser and publisher content, we include restrictions on content in our terms and conditions. We also take a large variety of brand safety measures to ensure that the brand equity of our clients is preserved as much as possible. These measures include determining that each publisher's inventory meets our content requirements and those of our clients to ensure that their display advertisements are not shown in inappropriate content categories. For that purpose, we use numerous internal systems and processes to filter out inventory in real time, including the list of suspect IP addresses from the Trustworthy Accountability Group and the lists of invalid traffic from several specialized external vendors. With respect to our inventory purchased through RTB exchanges, we utilize a mix of proprietary methodologies as well as third-party software to verify that inventory where the advertisement placement is shown conforms to our advertising guidelines and the content expectations and branding guidelines of our clients. 
Government Regulation
Further to the laws and regulations governing privacy and data protection described above, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. 
Competition 
We compete in the commerce media market and in the broader market for digital marketing and media monetization, primarily through Display Advertising. Our market is complex, rapidly evolving, highly competitive, still fragmented and yet rapidly consolidating. We face significant competition in this market, which we expect to intensify in the future, partially as a result of potential new entrants in our market, including but not limited to large well-established internet publishers and players, in particular as we continue to expand the breadth of the Criteo Commerce Media Platform. We currently compete with large, well-established companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Google, and Microsoft, pure play Demand-Side Platforms ("DSPs"), such as The Trade Desk, Viant Technology or Google's DV360, pure play Supply-Side Platforms (“SSPs”) such as Magnite, PubMatic or Google Ad Manager, and pure play retail SSPs such as Microsoft's PromoteIQ or Publicis' CitrusAd, that only focus on monetizing retailers' media, as well as smaller, privately held companies. Potential competition could emerge from large enterprise marketing platforms, like Adobe Systems Inc. ("Adobe"), Oracle Corporation ("Oracle") and Salesforce.com, Inc. ("Salesforce"), or public and private companies specialized in the Marketing Technology ("MarTech") space. In addition, web browsers, and desktop and mobile operating systems developed by large software companies like Google and Apple Inc. ("Apple") can have a significant influence and impact on the way we operate. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include: 
•access to granular commerce data on a large scale; 
•technology-based ability to activate data, in particular commerce data, for multiple digital marketing and media monetization goals, along the entire consumer journey;
•technology-based ability to generate advertisers' desired business outcomes, including, but not limited to, high return on advertising spend at scale;
•relevance and breadth of solutions to address numerous digital marketing and media monetization goals;
•breadth and depth of consumer reach, including in all environments and devices across the open Internet;
•marketer and publisher control over the objectives, parameters and performance of their advertising campaigns through modular, flexible and easy-to-use tools and services available on a self-service interface;
•measurability of the advertising spend performance, based on clear and transparent measurement metrics;
•completeness and effectiveness of solutions across digital devices, commerce and advertising environments, platforms and operating systems, advertising channels and publisher environments;
•transparency of pricing models, aligning with the value propositions provided to marketers;
•openness, transparency, security and fairness of data sharing and data management practices;
•client trust;
•global presence;
•client service and detailed, transparent client reporting available on a self-service basis; 
•commitment to data protection and user privacy; and
•ease of use.
We believe that we are well positioned in commerce media with respect to all of these factors and expect to continue to capture an increasing share of digital marketing and media monetization budgets worldwide.
Seasonality
Our client base consists primarily of commerce of companies in the Retail, Travel and Classifieds industries, which we refer to as “commerce companies” or “commerce clients”. In the digital Retail industry and the consumer brand verticals in particular, many businesses devote the largest portion of their advertising spend to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday spending by consumers. As a result, the concentration of advertising spend in the fourth quarter of the calendar year may be particularly pronounced. Our Retail clients typically conduct fewer advertising campaigns in the first and second quarters than they do in other quarters, while our Travel clients typically increase their travel campaigns in the first and third quarters and conduct fewer advertising campaigns in the second quarter. As a result, our revenue tends to be seasonal in nature. If the seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced, our operating cash flows could fluctuate materially from period to period.
Employees and Human Capital Management
We have a demonstrated history of commitment to the well-being and success of our workforce, and our company is driven by our core values of “open, together and impactful”. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 2,781 employees. Our employees employed by French entities (985 employees) are represented by a labor union and employee representative bodies (works' council, employee delegates and a health and safety committee) and covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider labor relations to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations.
Our Board, with assistance from our Compensation Committee, has oversight of and periodically reviews the Company's strategies, initiatives and programs with respect to the Company's culture, talent recruitment, development and retention and employee engagement.
Talent Acquisition & Development
Attracting and retaining top talent is a key objective at Criteo, and we invest significantly in talent acquisition. We are committed to offering an environment in which employees are ensured equal job opportunities and have a chance for advancement. As part of our transformation, we have undertaken a number of initiatives to enhance our employee value proposition and experience, including the recent publication of our Culture book, very flexible working practices and the renovation of our main offices to offer attractive workplaces. Our compelling employee value proposition, attractive compensation packages and vibrant culture are instrumental in our ability to attract and retain talent.
Additionally, we strive to provide exceptional training opportunities and development programs for our employees. In 2021, over 33,000 training hours were delivered to our employees. To assess and improve employee retention and engagement, we periodically survey employees, and take action to address areas of employee concern. In 2021, we carried out two employee surveys specific to COVID-19 concerns, soliciting feedback on a wide range of topics from well-being to productivity and hybrid work to social links with other employees and provided multiple services to our employees, including a hybrid way of working and several wellness interactive sessions.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
As a global technology company, we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture is the cornerstone for driving creative collaboration and sustainable change across the industry. We are proud that our employees can be themselves at work and we value diversity in the workforce; as of December 31, 2021, 41% of our 2,781 employees are female. As stated in our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policy, our mission is to sustain our focus on equity, and building stronger diversity through how we hire, develop, reward, and retain all talent at Criteo. We empower our employees to impact the industry, promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in everything we do, delivering richer experiences for all. In 2021, we achieved gender pay parity and extended our parental leave to be inclusive of our diverse workforce. Our efforts to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace are led by a dedicated Diversity, Equity and Inclusion leadership team who partner through the business and leverage our seven active Employees Resource Groups (“ERGs”) who engage with employees, support allyship and sponsorship to encourage community, networking and safe spaces for all diverse groups throughout Criteo. In 2021, over half of our employees volunteered across our seven ERGs. This work extends to our efforts to strengthen our inclusive culture and drive sustainable efforts that impact our environment and societal interests throughout and beyond Criteo. 
Health, Safety and Wellness
Employee health and safety is a priority for Criteo. We devote time and effort across all of our locations to provide positive working conditions, work-life balance and a healthy office environment for our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we immediately implemented a remote working arrangement that complied with all applicable government regulations and protected our employees while allowing them to continue to be effective in their jobs. We continue to stay updated on changes in government regulations and implement them to meet our employees’ changing health and wellness needs.
Total Rewards
We are focused on offering competitive compensation and comprehensive benefit packages designed to meet the needs of our employees and reward their efforts and contributions. We seek fairness in total compensation with reference to external comparisons, internal comparisons and the relationship between management and non-management compensation. Our total compensation package includes base pay, bonuses, equity awards, 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave and employee assistance programs among many others.
