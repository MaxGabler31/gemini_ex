Business Overview

We are a Social Networking Platform that connects its Users using the practice of treating food and/or beverage Products via our Platform. The participants in our Platform include: Shops, Sending Consumers, Receiving Consumers and Brands

Platform Benefits

Our Platform is designed to benefit Shops, Users, and Brands, as follows:


· | Shops
--+------


○ | Obtaining sales from Remote Customers 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------
○ | Obtaining additional awareness and visibility 
○ | Having online, real-time analytics on the spending of our Users


6


· | Users
--+------


○ | Staying in touch with friends, anywhere they might be in the world using the Remote Treating mode
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | Making new friends using the In-Shop Treating Mode 
○ | In both modes, using the method of Treating (purchasing and sending Treats) 


· | Brands
--+-------


○ | Gaining access to a targeted audience that is ensembled to send and receive food and/or beverage products
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | Getting customized brand positioning by advertising throughout our Platform 
○ | Having online, real-time analytics on the spending within the Platform 

How the Platform Works 

A Shop registers by paying an annual fee on our Platform, at which time it has access to our Platform and has established the ability to upload:

· | Its shop photos to be displayed on our app 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Its Treat (Food and/or Beverage Products) Catalog with pricing information
· | Its banking information, so we can execute relevant payments to its owners


A User downloads our App for free, completes account information, uploads his or her photo, and connects with friends by importing them from various sources, such as their phone catalog, Meta (Facebook), or other social networking platforms. 

Then the User gains access to our newsfeed that shows “connected friends” activity similar to other Social Networking platforms. Therefore, every User, can upload photos, “like” other connected User photos and send and receive notifications.

Following that, the User can select one of two “Treating Modes” to purchase and send a Treat to another User:


· | Under “Remote Treating” mode, a Sending Consumer can select any shop registered, in any country, select a Treat from the Shop’s catalog, purchase it, and a notification is sent to the Receiving Consumer that a Treat is ready for redemption 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Under “In-Shop Treating” mode, a Sending Consumer may “check-in” at a Shop registered in our Platform and gain access to all Users that have also checked-in during the same time; either existing “friends” or new people that they have the opportunity to Treat and meet. The Treat selection process is the same as in “Remote Treating Mode”.

Platform Data

Our platform is designed to be multi-lingual (currently operating in English, Greek and Romanian) and a multicurrency conversion feature (so a Sending Consumer from one country receives real-time conversion when purchasing a Treat for a Receiving Consumer from another country).

We started operations in Greece on August 13, 2021 (a market that we shall be managing directly with our own resources) and in Romania on August 26, 2021 (a market that we shall be managing using a Local Partner).
