ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel immuno-oncology products based off our proprietary Tri-specific Killer Engager (TriKE), Tetra-specific Killer Engager (TetraKE) and bi-specific Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) technology platforms. Our TriKE and TetraKE platforms generate proprietary moieties designed to harness and enhance the cancer killing abilities of a patient’s own natural killer, or NK, cells. Once bound to a NK cell, our moieties are designed to enhance the NK cell and precisely direct it to one or more specifically-targeted proteins (tumor antigens) expressed on a specific type of cancer, ultimately resulting in the cancer cell’s death. TriKEs and TetraKEs are made up of recombinant fusion proteins, can be designed to target any number of tumor antigens on hematologic malignancies, sarcomas or solid tumors and do not require patient-specific customization. They are designed to be dosed in a common outpatient setting similar to modern antibody therapeutics and are expected to have reasonably low cost of goods. Our ADC platform generates product candidates that are bi-specific, ligand-directed single-chain fusion proteins that, we believe, represent the next generation of ADCs.
 
  Our most advanced bi-specific ADC, which targets CD19+ and/or CD22+ hematological malignancies, is in a Phase 2 NHL/ALL trial, and we plan to begin a Phase 1 trial in CD33+ hematologic malignancies for our most advanced TriKE product candidate in the second half of 2018. We are initially targeting certain hematologic malignancies as we believe our product candidates may have certain advantages over existing and other in-development products. We are also developing TetraKE product candidates designed to target the larger solid tumor market and expect to begin human clinical trials in 2019.
 
  We also are focused on developing a portfolio of three central nervous system, or CNS, product candidates that are covered by issued or filed composition of matter patents and consist of innovative reformulations and/or repurposing of existing therapies. We expect to take advantage of our CNS portfolio by generating proof-of-concept data and/or achieving other milestones and ultimately entering into strategic transactions, which may include transactions with commercialization-oriented pharmaceutical companies.

  Our TriKE product candidates are single-chain, tri-specific scFv recombinant fusion proteins composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains (or heavy chain only) of anti-CD16 antibodies, wild-type or a modified form of IL-15 and the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of an antibody that precisely targets a specific tumor antigen. We utilize the NK stimulating cytokine human IL-15 as a crosslinker between the two scFvs which provides a self-sustaining signal that leads to the proliferation and activation of NK cells thus enhancing their ability to kill cancer cells mediated by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) via the highly potent CD16 activating receptor on our moieties. Our lead TriKE, OXS-3550, targeting CD33+ malignancies is expected to begin clinical testing in the second half of 2018. Our second TriKE product candidate, OXS-C3550, is a next-generation version of OXS-3550 containing a modified CD16 component.
 
  Our TetraKE product candidates are single-chain fusion proteins composed of human single-domain anti-CD16 antibody, wild-type IL-15 and the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of two antibodies that target two specific tumor antigens expressed on specific types of cancer cells. An example of a TetraKE product candidate is OXS-1615which targets EpCAM and CD133 positive solid tumors. EpCAM is found on many solid tumor cells of epithelial origin and CD133 is a marker for cancer stem cells. OXS-1615 is designed to enable a patient’s NK cells to kill not only the heterogeneous population of cancer cells found in many solid tumors but also kill the cancer stem cells that are typically responsible for recurrences. We intend to initiate human clinical testing for certain of our solid tumor product candidates in 2019.
 
  Our TriKEs and TetraKEs act by binding to a patient’s NK cell and a specific tumor antigen enabling an immune synapse between the now IL-15-enhanced NK cell and the targeted cancer cell. The formation of this immune synapse induces NK cell activation leading to the death of the cancer cell. The self-sustaining signal caused by our IL-15 cross-linker enables prolonged and enhanced proliferation and activation of NK cells similar to the increased proliferation of T-cells caused by 41BB-L or CD28 intracellular domains in CAR-T therapy but without the need to enhance the patient’s NK cells ex vivo.
 
  We are using our TriKE and TetraKE platforms with the intent to bring to market multiple immuno-oncology products that can treat a wide range of hematologic malignancies, sarcoma and solid tumors. The platforms are scalable and we are putting processes in place to be able to produce IND-ready moieties in approximately 90-120 days after a specific TriKE or TetraKE conceptual design. After conducting market and competitive research, specific moieties can then be rapidly advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with larger companies. We are currently evaluating over a dozen moieties and intend to announce additional clinical product candidates in the second half of 2018. We believe our TriKEs and TetraKEs will have the ability, if approved for marketing, to be used on a stand-alone basis, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics, be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy and potentially overcome certain limitations of current chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR-T, therapy.
 
  We also believe our bi-specific, ligand-directed single-chain fusion proteins represents the next generation of ADCs. Our lead bi-specific ADC, OXS-1550, which targets CD19+ and/or CD22+ hematological malignancies is currently in a Phase 2 trial being conducted at the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell leukemias or lymphomas. We believe OXS-1550 has certain properties that could result in competitive advantages over recently approved ADC products targeting leukemias and lymphomas. In a Phase 1 trial, of nine patients that achieved adequate blood levels, we saw a durable complete response, or CR, in two heavily pretreated patients. One patient, who had failed multiple previous treatment regimens, has been cancer free since early 2015.
  
  Our initial work has been conducted in collaboration with the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota under a program led by Dr. Jeffrey Miller, the Deputy Director. Dr. Miller is a recognized leader in the field of NK cell and IL-15 biology and their therapeutic potential. We have exclusive rights to the TriKE and TetraKE platforms and are generating additional intellectual property around specific moieties.
 
  We also are focused on developing a portfolio of central nervous system, or CNS, product candidates that are covered by formulation patents and issued or filed composition of matter patents and consist of innovative reformulations and/or repurposing of existing therapies. We believe our CNS product candidates represent potentially near-to-market opportunities that may have broader potential applicability beyond their initial indication. Certain members of our management team have a track-record of developing CNS products and product candidates with similar strategies including at Chase Pharmaceuticals and Prestwick Pharmaceuticals. We have designed our CNS clinical programs with the intent to efficiently advance each program to an FDA New Drug Application in a certain initial indication and expand applicable markets potentially after approval. Our three product candidates are initially targeting a rare autoimmune disease Myasthenia Gravis, a rare neuropathic pain indication, trigeminal neuralgia, and a vestibular disorder, motion sickness.

  Immuno-Oncology Platform
 
  Tri-specific Killer Engagers (TriKEs) and Tetra-specific Killer Engagers (TetraKEs)
 
  The generation of chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, expressing T cells from monoclonal antibodies has represented an important step forward in cancer therapy. These therapies involve the genetic engineering of T cells to express either CARs, or T cell receptors, or TCRs, and are designed such that the modified T cells can recognize and destroy cancer cells. While a great deal of interest has recently been placed upon chimeric antigen receptor T, or CAR-T, therapy, it has certain limitations for broad potential applicability because it can require an individual approach that is expensive and time consuming, and may be difficult to apply on a large scale. We believe there is an unmet need for targeted immuno-oncology therapies that have the potential to be dosed in a patient-friendly outpatient setting, can be used on a stand-alone basis, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics and/or be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy. We believe our TriKE and TetraKE constructs have this potential and therefore we have generated, and intend to continue to generate, a pipeline of product candidates to be advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with larger companies.
  
  NK cells represent an important immunotherapeutic target as they are involved in tumor immune-surveillance, can mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), contain pre-made granules with perforin and granzyme B and can quickly secrete inflammatory cytokines, and unlike T cells they do not require antigen priming and can kill cells in the absence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation.
   Unlike full-length antibodies, TriKEs and TetraKEs are small single-chain fusion proteins that bind the CD16 receptor of NK cells directly producing a potent and lasting response, as demonstrated by preclinical studies. An additional benefit they may have is attractive biodistribution, as a consequence of their smaller size, which we expect to be important in the treatment of solid tumors. In addition to these advantages, TriKEs and TetraKEs are designed to be non-immunogenic, have appropriate clearance properties and can be engineered quickly to target a variety of tumor antigens.
 
  Background and Select Non-Clinical Data
 
  In conjunction with our research agreement with the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota, the exploration of targeting NK cells to a variety of tumors initially focused on novel bi-specific killer engagers, or BiKEs, composed of the variable portions of antibodies targeting the CD16 activating receptor on NK cells and CD33 (AML and MDS; see figure below), CD19/CD22 (B cell lymphomas), or EpCAM (epithelial tumors (breast, colon, and lung)) on the tumor cells.

  Subsequently, a tri-specific (TriKE) construct that replaced the linker molecule between the CD16 scFv and the CD33 scFv with a modified IL-15 molecule, containing flanking sequences, was generated and tested. Data indicate that the CD16 x IL-15 x CD33 and CD16 x IL-15 x EpCAM TriKEs potently induce proliferation of healthy donor NK cells, possibly greater than that induced by exogenous IL-15, which is absent in the BiKE platform. Targeted delivery of the IL-15 through the TriKE also resulted in specific expansion of the NK cells without inducing T cell expansion on post-transplant patient samples.
 
  When compared to the CD16 x CD33 BiKE, the CD16 x IL-15 x CD33 TriKE is also capable of potently restoring killing capacity of post-transplant NK cells against CD33-expressing HL-60 Targets and primary AML blasts. These results demonstrated the ability to functionally incorporate an IL-5 cytokine into the BiKE platform and also demonstrated the possibility of targeting a variety of cytokines directly to NK cells while reducing off-target effects and the amount of cytokines needed to obtain biologically relevant function.
 
  The figure below is a schematic of a BiKE construct (top) and a TriKE construct (bottom), which has the modified IL-15 linker between the CD16 scFv and the CD33 scFv components.
 
 


 

  The TriKE constructs were also tested against three separate human tumor cell lines: HL-60 (promyelocitic leukemia), Raji (Burkitt’s lymphoma), and HT29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), in addition to a model for ovarian cancer. All cell lines contained the Luc reporter to allow for in vivo imaging of the tumors. These systems were used to show in vivo efficacy of BiKEs (1633) and TriKEs (OXS-3550) against relevant human tumor targets (HL-60-luc) over an extended period of time. The system consisted of initial conditioning of mice using radiation (250-275 cGy), followed by injection of the tumor cells (I.V. for HL-60-luc and Raji-luc, intra-splenic for HT29-luc and IP for ovarian for MA-148-luc), a three-day growth phase, injection of human NK cells, and repeated injection of the drugs of interest, BiKE and TriKE (three to five times a week). Imaging was carried out at day 7, 14, and 21, and extended as needed.
 
  Figure A below shows the results (tumor burden and mortality) when dosing NK cells alone (top panel), the BiKE version (lacking IL-15) of OXS-3550 (middle panel; called 1633), and the TriKE, OXS-3550 (bottom panel; then called 161533) in the above described human tumor model, HL-60-luc. In the NK-cell-only arm, two out of the five mice were dead by day 21 with two of the surviving mice having extensive tumor burden as depicted by the colored images. In contrast, all five mice in each of the BiKE and TriKE arms survived. In addition, the tumor burden in the TriKE-treated mice was significantly less than in the BiKE-treated mice, demonstrating the improved efficacy from NK cells in the TriKE-treated mice.

  Based on these results, and others, the IND for OXS-3550 was filed in June 2017 by the University of Minnesota. FDA requested that additional nonclinical toxicology be conducted prior to initiating clinical trials. The FDA also requested some additional information and clarifications on the manufacturing (CMC) and clinical packages. We plan to incorporate the requested additional toxicology studies, information and clarifications in the IND that was transferred to us from the University of Minnesota in October 2017. We expect to begin a Phase 1 clinical trial for OXS-3550 in the second half of 2018.
 
  Generation of humanized single-domain antibody targeting CD16 for incorporation into the TriKE platform
 
  To develop second generation TriKEs, we designed a new humanized CD16 engager derived from a single-domain antibody. While scFvs consist of a heavy and a light variable chain joined by a linker, single-domain antibodies consist of a single variable heavy chain capable of engaging without the need of a light chain counterpart (see figure below).

  These single-domain antibodies are thought to have certain attractive features for antibody engineering, including physical stability, ability to bind deep grooves, and increased production yields, amongst others. Pre-clinical studies demonstrated increased activity (NK Cell Degranulation) and functionality (NC Cell Cytokine Production) of the single-domain CD16 TriKE (OXS-C3550) compared to the original TriKE (OXS-3550) (see figure below). These data were presented at the 2017 American Society of Hematology Conference.
 

  Targeting Solid Tumors and Other Potentially Attractive Characteristics
 
  Unlike full-length antibodies, TriKEs and TetraKEs are small single-chain fusion proteins that bind the CD16 receptor of NK cells directly producing a potentially more potent and lasting response as demonstrated by preclinical studies. An additional benefit that they may have is an attractive biodistribution, because of their smaller size, which we expect to be important in the treatment of solid tumors. In addition to these potential advantages, TriKEs and TetraKEs are designed to be non-immunogenic, have appropriate clearance properties and can be engineered quickly to target a variety of tumor antigens. We believe these attributes make them an ideal pharmaceutical platform for potentiated NK cell-based immunotherapies and have the potential to overcome some of the limitations of CAR-T therapy and other antibody therapies.

  Examples of our earlier stage solid tumor targeting product candidates are focused on EpCAM, Her2, Mesothelin (mesothelioma and lung adenocarcinoma), and CD133 alone and in combination. We believe certain of these constructs have the potential to target prostate, breast, colon, ovarian, liver, and head and neck cancers. We intend to initiate human clinical testing for certain of our solid tumor product candidates in 2019.
 
  Efficient Advancement of Potential Future Product Candidates --Production and Scale Up
 
  We are using our TriKE and TetraKE platforms with the intent to bring to market multiple immuno-oncology products that can treat a range of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and solid tumors. The platforms are scalable and we are currently working with several third parties investigating the optimal expression system of the TriKEs and TetraKE constructs which we expect to be part of a process in which we are able to produce IND-ready moieties in approximately 90-120 days after the construct conceptual design.
 
  After conducting market and competitive research, specific moieties can then be rapidly advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with larger companies. We are currently evaluating over a dozen moieties and intend to announce additional clinical product candidates in the second half of 2018.
 
  We believe our TriKEs and TetraKEs will have the ability, if approved for marketing, to be used on a stand-alone basis, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics, or be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy and potentially overcome certain limitations of current chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR-T, therapy.
 
  Bi-specific Antibody-Drug Conjugates Program
 
  Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of potent biopharmaceutical drugs designed as a targeted therapy for the treatment of cancer.   ADCs combine the antitumor potency of highly cytotoxic small-molecule drugs with the high selectivity, pharmacokinetic profile of mAbs. These attributes allow sensitive discrimination between healthy and diseased tissue. We believe our bi-specific, ligand-directed single-chain fusion protein represents an example of the next generation of ADCs.
 
  OXS-1550, our bi-specific ADC, is a single chain bispecific recombinant fusion protein consisting of an anti-CD22 sFv, an anti-CD19 sFv, and DT390 (the catalytic and translocation domains of diphtheria toxin). It is a cytotoxic molecule produced by recombinant DNA techniques composed of a fusion gene consisting of sequences for DT390 and also sequences encoding two separate and distinct sFvs, one recognizing CD22 and one recognizing CD19. The anti-CD22 sFv comes from the monoclonal antibody RFB4 and this sFv is currently in clinical trials involving another anti-CD22 immunotoxin called BL22. The anti-CD19 sFv is from the monoclonal antibody HD37 that has previously been used clinically. Published preclinical studies have shown that the presence of both sFvs on the same single chain molecule results in a bispecific fusion toxin that has superior activity and anti-cancer effects compared to the monospecific fusion toxins. Between the VL and VH regions of the sFvs, we have introduced aggregation reducing sequences (ARL) which has produced a product which has demonstrated better activity against scid mouse systemic models of B cell malignancy. The action of DT2219 occurs as a result of binding to the CD22 and/or CD19 receptors, subsequent internalization, and enzymatic inhibition of protein synthesis leading to cell death.
 
  We believe that our single-chain bi-specific recombinant fusion proteins utilizing novel linkers and innovative warheads represent an important advance over currently marketed ADCs. Utilizing our bi-specific ADC platform we have the ability to generate novel ADCs with unique targets, linkers and warheads. This platform provides us with the ability to rapidly construct novel ADCs with the potential to treat a wide range of cancers, including hematologic and solid tumors.
 
  Immuno-Oncology Product Candidates
 
  OXS-1550
 
  OXS-1550 is a bispecific scFv recombinant fusion protein-drug conjugate composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 antibodies and a modified form of diphtheria toxin (DT390) as its cytotoxic drug payload.  CD19 is a membrane glycoprotein present on the surface of all stages of B-lymphocyte development and is also expressed on most B-cell mature lymphoma cells and leukemia cells.  CD22 is a glycoprotein expressed on B-lineage lymphoid precursors, including precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and often is co-expressed with CD19 on mature B-cell malignancies such as lymphoma.

  OXS-1550 targets cancer cells expressing the CD19 receptor or CD22 receptor or both receptors.  When OXS-1550 binds to cancer cells, the cancer cells internalize OXS-1550, and are killed due to the action of drug’s cytotoxic diphtheria toxin payload.  OXS-1550 has completed a Phase 1 human clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma or leukemia.
 
  The initial Phase 1 study enrolled 25 patients with mature or precursor B-cell lymphoid malignancies expressing the CD19 receptor or CD22 receptor or both receptors. All 25 patients received at least a single course of therapy. The treatment at the higher doses produced objective tumor responses with one patient in continuous partial remission and the second in complete remission. A Phase 2 trial of OXS-1550 is underway in patients with ALL/NHL. The FDA-approved clinical trial is being conducted at the University of Minnesota's Masonic Cancer Center. There are currently 18 patients enrolled in this clinical trial. Patients in this trial are given an approved increased dosage and schedule of OXS-1550.
 
  We began enrolling patients in Phase 2 trial of OXS-1550 during the first quarter of 2017 and the first patient began dosing in April 2017. We expect data from this Phase 2 trial to be available in the second half 2018.
 
  OXS-3550
 
  OXS-3550 is our first TriKE product candidate. It is a single-chain, tri-specific scFv recombinant fusion protein conjugate composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD16 and anti-CD33 antibodies and a modified form of IL-15. We intend to study this anti-CD16-IL-15-anti-CD33 TriKE in CD33 positive leukemias, a marker expressed on tumor cells in acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, and other hematopoietic malignancies. CD33 is primarily a myeloid differentiation antigen with endocytic properties broadly expressed on AML blasts and, possibly, some leukemic stem cells. CD33 or Siglec-3 (sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 3, SIGLEC3, SIGLEC3, gp67, p67) is a transmembrane receptor expressed on cells of myeloid lineage. It is usually considered myeloid-specific, but it can also be found on some lymphoid cells. The anti-CD33 antibody fragment that will be used for these studies was derived from the M195 humanized anti-CD33 scFV and has been used in multiple human clinical studies. It has been exploited as target for therapeutic antibodies for many years. We believe the recent approval of the antibody-drug conjugate gemtuzumab validates this targeted approach.
 
 The OXS-3550 IND will focus on AML, the most common form of adult leukemia with 21,000 new cases expected in 2018 alone (American Cancer Society). These patients typically receive frontline therapy, usually chemotherapy, including cytarabine and an anthracycline, a therapy that has not changed in over 40 years. About half will have relapses and require alternative therapies. In addition, MDS incidence rates have dramatically increased in the population of the United States from 3.3 per 100,000 individuals from 2001-2004 to 70 per 100,000 annually, MDS is especially prevalent in elderly patients that have a median age of 76 years at diagnosis. The survival of patients with MDS is poor due to decreased eligibility, as a result of advanced age, for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT), the only curative MDS treatment (Cogle CR. Incidence and Burden of the Myelodysplastic Syndromes. Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2015; 10(3):272-281). We expect OXS-3550 could serve as a relatively safe, cost-effective, and easy-to-use therapy for resistant/relapsing AML and could also be combined with chemotherapy as frontline therapy thus targeting the larger market.
 
  The IND for OXS-3550 was filed in June 2017 by the University of Minnesota. FDA requested that additional preclinical toxicology be conducted prior to initiating clinical trials. The FDA also requested some additional information and clarifications on the manufacturing (CMC) and clinical packages. The requested additional toxicology studies, information and clarifications will be incorporated by our company in the IND that was transferred to us from the University of Minnesota in October 2017. We expect to begin a Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2018.
 
  OXS-C3550
 
  OXS-C3550 is a next-generation, follow-on, to our lead TriKE, OXS-3550. OXS-C3550 contains a modified CD16 moiety which has improved binding characteristics and enhanced tumor cell killing based on functional assays and animal models of AML. Using our platform technology, we substituted the anti-CD16 scFv arm in OXS-3550 with a novel humanized single-domain anti-CD16 antibody to create this second-generation molecule which may have improved functionality. Single-domain antibodies, such as OXS-C3550, typically have several advantages, including better stability and solubility, more resistance to pH changes, can better recognize hidden antigenic sites, lack of a VL portion thus preventing VH/VL mispairing and are suitable for construction of larger molecules. OXS-C3550 induced a potent increase in NK cell degranulation, measured by CD107a expression against HL-60 AML tumor targets when compared to our first-generation TriKE (70.75±3.65% vs. 30.75±5.05%). IFN  production was similarly enhanced (29.2±1.8% vs. 6.55±1.07%). OXS-C3550 also exhibited a robust increase in NK cell proliferation (57.65±6.05% vs. 20.75±2.55%).

  OXS-3550 studies will help inform the development of OXS-C3550 which we expect will de-risk the OXS-C3550 program as data will be generated to make an informed decision on which, or both, will be brought into later phase studies.
  
  OXS-1615
  
  OXS-1615 is an example of our first-generation TetraKEs designed for the treatment of solid tumors. It is a single-chain fusion protein composed of CD16-IL15-EpCAM-CD133. EpCAM is found on many solid tumor cells of epithelial origin and CD133 is a marker for cancer stem cells. This TetraKE is designed to target not only the heterogeneous population of cancer cells found in solid tumors but also the cancer stem cells that are typically responsible for recurrences. We intend to initiate human clinical testing for certain of our solid tumor product candidates in 2019.
  
  Central Nervous System
 
  Our CNS portfolio consists of innovative reformulations and/or repurposing of existing therapies and are covered by issued formulation or filed composition of matter patents (PCTs and provisionals). We believe our CNS product candidates address numerous unmet medical needs that can lead to improved efficacy and/or address tolerability and safety issues that tend to limit the usefulness of the original approved drug. Our CNS drug candidates address disease states such as chronic neuropathic pain (trigeminal neuralgia), myasthenia gravis and vestibular disorders.
 
  In January 2018, we completed dosing in our Phase 1 clinical trial for GTP-004, our product candidate for the treatment for the symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Based on the data, and discussions with key opinion leaders, we expect to be in a position to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients in the second half of 2018. We also began a proof-of-concept clinical trial for GTP-011, a 72-hour patch for the prevention of motion sickness, in late February 2018. We anticipate that the new drug application, or NDA, will be a 505(b)2 NDA for each of these programs. PainBrake® is designed to enable accurate dose fractionation for the treatment of certain forms of neuropathic pain and we expect to complete the manufacturing tablets for a bioequivalence study in the second half of 2018 and to conduct a bioequivalence study subsequently.
 
  CNS Product Candidates
 
  GTP-004
 
 GTP-004 is a fixed-dose combination tablet for the treatment of the muscle weakness associated with myasthenia gravis, or MG, a chronic autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction characterized by muscle weakness. MG affects an estimated approximately 36,000 to 60,000 people in the U.S. The basic abnormality in MG is a reduction in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) or neighboring proteins at the neuromuscular junctions (Drachman, 2016). In neonatal myasthenia, the fetus may acquire antibodies from a mother affected with MG. Generally, cases of neonatal MG are temporary and the child's symptoms usually disappear within 2-3 months after birth (Myasthenia Gravis Fact Sheet; National Institute of neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2016). Rarely, children may have congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) caused by defective gene mutations (Engel, 2012). In some cases, degeneration of the nerves that innervate muscles such as occurs with aging (Lexel, 1997) leads to a myasthenic syndrome. Recently (Makarious et al, 2017), have reported on a myasthenic syndrome associated with the use of checkpoint inhibitors.
 
 Cholinesterase inhibitors, or ChEIs, that do not get into the brain (do not cross the blood-brain barrier), such as pyridostigmine and neostigmine are used to treat the muscular weakness associated with myasthenia gravis and other myasthenic syndromes). However, ChEIs also act at cholinergic synapses in the gut to cause GI side effects such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, which are dose-limiting (Engel 2012; Abicht et al, 2003 updated in 2014).

 GTP-004 combines pyridostigmine with ondansetron, designed to attenuate the gastrointestinal, or GI, side effects of pyridostigmine alone. Mitigating the GI side effects of pyridostigmine with a drug that prevents diarrhea, nausea and vomiting should lead to greater patient comfort, safety, and compliance as well as to improved efficacy. Several provisional patent applications protecting the combination of neostigmine or pyridostigmine with a number of antiemetic drugs were filed by GTP in early 2017.
 
 GTP-004 completed dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial in January 2018. The objective of the Phase 1 clinical trial was to demonstrate that GI side effects of pyridostigmine are reduced with GTP-004. Healthy volunteers were enrolled in the Phase 1 study. Following enrollment, subjects received single increasing oral doses of pyridostigmine (ranging from 30 to 120mg) administered once daily in the morning. Once subjects experienced intolerable GI side effects and reached First Intolerable Dose -FID1- as defined by protocol criteria, upward dose escalation of pyridostigmine was discontinued and subjects were washed out for 2 to 7 days. Next, subjects that reached FID received daily increasing doses of pyridostigmine in combination with ondansetron.
 
 Three subjects (2 males, one female; aged 34 to 43) reached intolerable gastrointestinal side effects with pyridostigmine alone. The dose-limiting gastro-intestinal adverse event occurred at 60 mg for 2 subjects, and 90 mg for the third subject. When these three subjects received GTP-004 (pyridostigmine with ondansetron), gastro-intestinal adverse events were abrogated, and all subjects tolerated doses as high as 120 mg, the maximum allowed dose allowed by the protocol.
 
 Based on the data from the Phase 1 clinical trial, and discussions with key opinion leaders, we expect to be in a position to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients in the second half of 2018.
 
 Provisional patent applications protecting the combination of Mestinon® or Prostigmine® with a number of antiemetic drugs were filed by GTP in early 2017.
 
  PainBrake
 
 PainBrake is a new patented formulation of carbamazepine (Tegretol®) that enables accurate dose fractionation for the treatment of neuropathic pain, a condition that results from a dysfunction of nerves involved in the perception of pain and that is typically chronic and particularly prevalent in elderly patients. An NIH-supported study published in 2009 estimated that almost 16 million Americans suffer from chronic neuropathic pain (Yawn et al., 2009) and this number is expected to increase due to the aging population. Current drugs provide a useful degree of pain relief in only about half the patients, very few patients achieve complete relief of pain (Nightingale, 2012). Peak dose-limiting side effects, mainly sedation, somnolence, dizziness and balance problems which are poorly tolerated by the elderly (Oomens et al., 2015) cause patients to be under-dosed, thereby contributing to inadequate pain relief. This is particularly true for carbamazepine, a drug that is considered to be the first line therapy for the treatment of certain forms of neuropathic pain (Zakrzewska, 2015).
 
 To overcome dose-limiting side effects, PainBrake tablets employ an innovative bilayered, deeply scored design patented by AccuBreak. The top layer contains carbamazepine and is pre-divided by deep scoring during the manufacturing process to provide accuracy of dose adjustments by enabling easy tablet splitting into exact doses. The bottom layer provides mechanical stability and serves as the break region when splitting the tablet. We have in-licensed against milestones and royalties the worldwide rights to the use of the AccuBreak technology for the delivery of drugs that like carbamazepine are voltage-gated sodium channel blockers.  The core patent for the AccuBreak technology expires in 2025.
 
 PainBrake® is designed to enable accurate dose fractionation for the treatment of certain forms of neuropathic pain and we expect to complete the manufacturing tablets for a bioequivalence study in the second half of 2018 and to begin a bioequivalence study as a subsequent step.

  GTP-011
 
 We are developing GTP-011 as a 72-hour transdermal product for the prevention of motion sickness, a well-known syndrome that typically involves nausea and vomiting in otherwise healthy people and that occurs upon exposure to certain types of motion.
 
  Currently, the scopolamine patch (Transderm Scop® from Novartis) is viewed as a first-line medication for prevention of motion sickness (Gil et al., 2012; Brainard and Gresham, 2014). However, side effects can be of particular concern and include sedation (Spinks et al., 2004), reduced memory for new information, impaired attention, and lowered feelings of alertness (Parrott, 1989). Mental confusion or delirium can occur after application of scopolamine patch (Seo et al., 2009). Elderly people as well as people with undetected incipient dementia or mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, may be particularly prone to develop mental confusion after applying the scopolamine patch (Seo et al., 2009). 
 
 GTP-011, like scopolamine, is a transdermal formulation that contains a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Unlike scopolamine, however, GTP-011’s active ingredient has been reported not to affect memory and cognition and has a low incidence of sedation (Kay et al., 2012). GTP-011 may thus be a more favorable alternative, if approved for marketing, to the scopolamine patch for the treatment of motion sickness. Since GTP-011 is expected to be a new formulation of an approved drug, we anticipate that the NDA will be a 505(B)2 NDA. We began a proof-of-concept clinical trial for GTP-011 in late February 2018.
 
  Our Strategy
 
  Our goal is to be a leader in immuno-oncology therapies targeting a broad range of indications including hematological malignancies, sarcoma and solid tumors and to generate value from our CNS product candidates. Key elements of our strategy are to: 
 
  Expedite clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our bi-specific ADC, OXS-1550, in specific indications with a high unmet-medical need such as patients who are resistant or refractory to conventional treatment and also assess fast-to-market strategies in potential orphan indications 
 
  Based upon promising clinical results from the initial OXS-1550 Phase 1 study, we began enrolling patients in a Phase 2 trial during the first quarter of 2017 for our most advanced oncology product candidate, OXS-1550, for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell leukemias or lymphomas. In the Phase 1 study, of the nine patients who received OXS-1550 at the higher doses, two had durable complete responses in heavily pretreated patients. One of these patients, who had failed multiple previous treatment regimens, has been cancer free since the beginning of 2015.
 
  The approximately 34 patient, open label, two stage, FDA-approved Phase 2 trial is being conducted at the University of Minnesota's Masonic Cancer Center. The trial is a continuation of the dose and schedule finding component of the Phase 1 study using the dose limiting toxicity identified in the Phase 1 but with a higher number of cycles. The trial is designed to confirm the safety of OXS-1550 and make a preliminary determination of activity level by disease. There are currently 18 patients enrolled in the Phase 2 trial and we expect data from this Phase 2 trial to be available in the second half 2018.
  
  We will also utilize our bi-specific ADC platform to generate novel ADCs with unique targets, linkers and warheads. We anticipate that this platform will give us the ability to rapidly construct novel ADCs with the potential to treat a wide range of cancers, including hematologic and solid tumors.
 
  Rapidly advanced our Tri-specific Killer Engagers (TriKEs), OXS-3550 and OXS-C3550
 
 Our TriKE and TetraKE product candidates have the potential to be groundbreaking therapies targeting a broad range of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and solid tumors. We are preparing to study OXS-3550, an anti-CD16-IL-15-anti-CD33 TriKE in CD33 positive leukemias, a marker expressed on tumor cells in AML, MDS and other myeloid malignancies. We expect to begin a Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2018 in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. The Phase 1 trial will be a dose finding study. We expect this will be closely followed by Phase 2 trials to determine the most efficacious dosing and cycles with the aim to maximize efficacy while minimizing on-target, off-disease adverse events.
  
   
11


  
 
  OXS-C3550 contains a humanized single-domain anti-CD16 moiety which demonstrated improved binding characteristics and enhanced tumor cell killing based on functional assays and animal models of AML.
 
 We have designed OXS-3550 and OXS-C3550, if approved for marketing, to serve as a relatively safe, cost-effective, and easy-to-use therapies for resistant/relapsing AML or MDS which could also be combined with chemotherapy as frontline therapy thus targeting a broad AML/MDS market.
 
  OXS-C3550 is a next-generation, follow-on, to our lead TriKE, OXS-3550. OXS-3550 studies will help inform the development of OXS-C3550. We believe this will de-risk the OXS-C3550 program as the data being generated will help to make informed decisions on which, or both, will be brought into later phase studies and in which patient populations.
 
  Utilize our TriKE and TetraKE platform technologies to develop a robust pipeline of targeted immuno-oncology products targeting a wide range of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and solid tumors for development on our own and through potential collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies
 
  We are using our TriKE and TetraKE platforms with the intent to bring to market multiple, targeted, off-the-shelf therapies that can treat a range of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and solid tumors. The platforms are scalable and we are currently working with several third parties investigating the optimal expression system of the TriKEs and TetraKE constructs which we expect to be part of a process in which we are able to produce IND-ready moieties in approximately 90-120 days after the construct conceptual design. After conducting market and competitive research, specific moieties can then be rapidly advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
 
  We are currently evaluating over a dozen moieties and intend to announce additional clinical product candidates in the second half of 2018. We intend to initiate human clinical testing for certain of our solid tumor product candidates in 2019.
 
  We believe our TriKEs and TetraKEs will have the ability, if approved for marketing, to be used on a stand-alone basis, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics, or be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy and potentially overcome certain limitations of current chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR-T, therapy.
 
  Continue our collaborative relationship with the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota, under a program led by Dr. Jeffrey Miller and become the leading NK-oriented immune-oncology company
 
  We believe that the TriKE and TetraKE constructs represent potentially groundbreaking innovations in immunotherapy. In July 2016 we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Minnesota to develop and commercialize cancer therapies using TriKE and TetraKE technology developed by researchers at the university to target NK cells to cancer.
 
  We believe TriKE and TetraKE therapeutics have the potential to significantly impact the standard of care for hematologic malignancies, sarcomas, as well as solid tumors. The direct engagement of the NK cell with the tumor cell via very specific receptors may increase the efficacy while decrease the toxicity seen with other forms of immunotherapies. If approved, we expect the TriKEs and TetraKEs will be able to be administered at cancer treatment facilities without the need for specialized centers or product-specific trained staff.
 
  We also intend to selectively evaluate and potentially acquire or enter into licensing or other agreements for technologies and/or product candidates that we believe would complement our oncology product candidates and platform technologies.

  Monetize our CNS programs through transactions with commercialization-oriented pharmaceutical companies and/or other transactions
 
  Our CNS portfolio consists of innovative reformulations and/or repurposing of existing therapies and are covered by formulation patents or filed composition of matter patents (PCTs and provisional applications) and represent, what we believe to be, near-to-market product opportunities. Our CNS programs address numerous unmet medical needs that, if approved, we believe may lead to improved efficacy while addressing tolerability and safety issues that tend to limit the usefulness of the original approved drugs.
  
  We expect to take advantage of our CNS portfolio by generating proof-of-concept data and/or achieving other milestones and ultimately entering into transactions with commercialization-oriented pharmaceutical companies, which could result in income, or enter into other transaction structures with the intent to generate value for our shareholders.
  
  Oncology Markets
 
  B-cell Lymphomas/Leukemias
 
 B-cell lymphoma is a type of cancer that forms in B cells (a type of immune system cell). B­cell lymphomas may be either indolent (slow-growing) or aggressive (fast-growing). Most B­cell lymphomas are non-Hodgkin lymphomas. There are many different types of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. These include Burkitt lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. It is the most common type of non- Hodgkin lymphoma among adults, with an annual incidence of 7–8 cases per 100,000 people per year.
 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
 
 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, is an acute form of leukemia, or cancer of the white blood cells, characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of immature white blood cells, known as lymphoblasts. In persons with ALL, lymphoblasts are overproduced in the bone marrow and continuously multiply, causing damage and death by inhibiting the production of normal cells (such as red and white blood cells and platelets) in the bone marrow and by spreading (infiltrating) to other organs.
 
 It is estimated that there will be approximately 6,000 new cases of ALL reported in the United States in 2018 (ACS Cancer Facts & Figures 2018). "Acute" is defined by the World Health Organization standards, in which greater than 20% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is defined as having less than 20% blasts in the bone marrow. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is seen in both children and adults; the highest incidence is seen between ages 2 and 5 years. ALL is the most common childhood cancer constituting about 23 to 30% of cancers before age 15. Although 80 to 90% of children will have a durable complete response with treatment it is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among children.
 
  Multiple Myeloma
 
 Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that forms in white blood cells and will affect an estimated 30,770 people in 2018 in the U.S. causing about 12,770 deaths. Multiple myeloma causes cancer cells to accumulate in the bone marrow, where they crowd out healthy blood cells. Multiple myeloma is also characterized by destructive lytic bone lesions (rounded, punched-out areas of bone), diffuse osteoporosis, bone pain, and the production of abnormal proteins which accumulate in the urine. Anemia is also present in most multiple myeloma patients at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up. Anemia in multiple myeloma is multifactorial and is secondary to bone marrow replacement by malignant plasma cells, chronic inflammation, relative erythropoietin deficiency, and vitamin deficiency. Plasma cell leukemia, a condition in which plasma cells comprise greater than 20% of peripheral leukocytes, is typically a terminal stage of multiple myeloma and is associated with short survival.

  Myeloid Leukemias
 
  Acute Myeloid Leukemia
 
  AML is a heterogeneous hematologic stem cell malignancy in adults with incidence rate of 3–5% per 100,000 populations. The median age at the time of diagnosis is 65–69 years. AML is an aggressive disease and is fatal without anti-leukemic treatment. AML is the most common form of adult leukemia with 20,000 new cases each year. These patients will require frontline therapy, usually chemotherapy including cytarabine and an anthracycline, a therapy that has not changed in over 40 years. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by dysplastic features of erythroid/myeloid/megakaryocytic lineages, progressive bone marrow failure, a varying percentage of blast cells, and enhanced risk to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia. It is estimated that over 10,000 new cases of MDS are diagnosed each year and there are minimal treatment options; other estimates have put this number higher. In addition, the incidence of MDS is rising for unknown reasons.
 Solid Tumors
 
 In the United States, in 2018, it is estimated there will be approximately 1,735,350 new cases of cancer resulting in over 600,000 deaths. Greater than 80% of these cancers will be classified as solid tumors. The most prevalent new cases of solid tumors being breast, lung, prostate, colorectal and bladder. (American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts & Figures 2018)
 Sarcomas
 
 A sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops from certain tissues, like bone or muscle. Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are the main types of sarcoma. Soft tissue sarcomas can develop from soft tissues like fat, muscle, nerves, fibrous tissues, blood vessels, or deep skin tissues. They can be found in any part of the body. Most of them develop in the arms or legs. They can also be found in the trunk, head and neck area, internal organs, and the area in back of the abdominal cavity (known as the retroperitoneum). Sarcomas are not common tumors, and most cancers are the type of tumors called carcinomas.
 
 The American Cancer Society's estimates for soft tissue sarcomas in the United States for 2018 are (these statistics include both adults and children): about 13,040 new soft tissue sarcomas will be diagnosed (7,370 cases in males and 5,670 cases in females). 5,150 Americans (2,770 males and 2,380 females) are expected to die of soft tissue sarcomas. The most common types of sarcoma in adults are undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (previously called malignant fibrous histiocytoma), liposarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. Certain types occur more often in certain areas of the body than others. For example, leiomyosarcomas are the most common abdominal sarcoma, while liposarcomas and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma are most common in legs. But pathologists (doctors who specialize in diagnosing cancers by how they look under the microscope), may not always agree on the exact type of sarcoma. Sarcomas of uncertain type are very common. (American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts & Figures 2018)
 
  CNS Markets
 
  Chronic Neuropathic Pain
 
 Neuropathic pain has many causes, including trigeminal neuralgia, diabetes, certain forms of chemotherapy, trauma, toxins, infection such as postherpetic infection, immune deficiencies, ischemic disorders, and multiple sclerosis. According to the latest market report published by Persistence Market Research (November 2016) titled “Global Market Study on Neuropathic Pain: Anticonvulsants Drug Class Segment Projected to Witness the Highest Growth Through 2024,” the global neuropathic pain market was valued at $5.2 billion in 2015 and was estimated to reach a market valuation of $5.4 billion by 2016. The market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 5.6% during an eight-year forecast period 2016–2024 and reach $8.3 billion by the end of 2024.
 
   
14


  
 
  The chronic pain market continues to represent a major unmet medical need. Current drugs provide a useful degree of pain relief in only about half the patients (Nightingale, 2012). It is estimated that only one in four patients with neuropathic pain experiences over 50% pain relief, and 30% of patients have no or very little relief. Very few patients achieve complete pain relief. In most patients, pain relief is obtained at the price of burdensome side effects. For many drugs, inadequate pain relief is due to side effects that occur when drugs reach peak concentrations in the blood, these side effects are dose-dependent and dose-limiting and prevent the use of fully effective doses. As a consequence, patients are chronically under-dosed. This is particularly true for carbamazepine, a drug with which it may be possible to achieve nearly complete relief of pain in many patients who suffer from forms of neuropathic pain that respond to carbamazepine.
 
 Current treatments for neuropathic pain treat the symptom (pain) and include narcotic analgesics, voltage-gated sodium channel blockers, voltage-gated calcium channel blockers, glutamate NMDA NR2B antagonists (ketamine), drugs that increase monoamine transmission, and cannabinoids. However, these therapies have safety and tolerability issues including, for some, tolerance, abuse and addiction liability. Many have dose-limiting side effects that prevent patients from receiving fully effective doses of medication, further limiting efficacy. Some of the key players operating in the global neuropathic pain market are Depomed Inc. (NASDAQ:DEPO), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), GlaxoSmithKline PLC (NYSE:GSK), Sanofi S.A. (NYSE:SNY), Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), and Baxter Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:BAX), among others.
 
  Myasthenia Gravis
 
 MG is a rare, chronic autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction caused by antibodies that attack components of the postsynaptic membrane, impair neuromuscular transmission, and lead to varying degrees of weakness and fatigue of skeletal muscle. Recently, anti-cancer treatments with check-point inhibitors have been associated in some patients with rapidly progressive severe myasthenia gravis. The prevalence of MG in the United States is estimated at 14 to 20 per 100,000 population, approximately 36,000 to 60,000 cases in the US (Howard, 2015). Rarely, children may show signs of congenital myasthenia or congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). These are not autoimmune disorders, but are caused by defective genes that produce abnormal proteins instead of those that normally are involved in cholinergic transmission: acetylcholinesterase (the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine), acetylcholine receptors, and other proteins present along the muscle membrane (Engel, 2012).In some rare cases, a myasthenic syndrome is due to bi-allelic variants in the gene encoding the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) located in the presynaptic terminal (O’Grady et al, 2016). In other cases, degeneration of the nerves that innervate muscles such as occurs with aging (Lexel, 1997) leads to a myasthenic syndrome.
  
 Only two drugs are currently approved for the muscular symptoms of myasthenia gravis, namely Mestinon® and Prostigmine®. Both have the same mechanism of action, and both are associated with gastrointestinal side effects, which are an important source of discomfort for the patient, may be the source of non-compliance, or may result in the need to decrease the dose of ChEI to mitigate these side effects when these become dose-limiting. In many patients the side effects are dose limiting and prevent the administration of the fully effective dose. Attempts at overcoming these side effects using dose fractionation or a slow release formulation (Mestinon TimeSpan) have been disappointing.
 
  Motion Sickness
 
  The current transdermal market leader for the prevention of motion sickness is the 72-hour scopolamine patch (Gil et al., 2012) commercialized by Sandoz. However, this medication can cause a number of worrisome side effects., especially in the elderly, such as confusion and memory impairment. The scopolamine patch is not approved for children.

 Research and Development
 
 Expenditures for research and development activities related to continuing operations were $1,068,000 and $975,000 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
 Our currently projected expenditures for 2018 include approximately $10 million to $12 million for research and development. The actual cost of our programs could differ significantly from our current projections if we change our planned development process. In the event that actual costs of our clinical program, or any of our other ongoing research activities, are significantly higher than our current estimates, we may be required to significantly modify our planned level of operations.
 
 The successful development of any product candidate is highly uncertain. It is difficult to reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of, or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any product candidate, due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs. Any failure to complete any stage of the development of products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and liquidity.
 
  Competition
 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid technological change. Competition from domestic and foreign biotechnology companies, large pharmaceutical companies and other institutions is intense and expected to increase. A number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals in our targeted areas. According to a recent analysis by InVentiv Health there are over 800 companies developing approximately 1500 cancer immunotherapies via 4000 development projects across 535 targets. According to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Research Association, at the end of 2015 there were 135 drugs in development for the treatment of lymphomas (blood cell cancers including multiple myeloma).
 
 Many compounds are in development for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Current treatments for neuropathic include narcotic analgesics, voltage-gated sodium channel blockers, voltage-gated calcium channel blockers, glutamate NMDA NR2B antagonists (ketamine), drugs that increase monoamine transmission, and cannabinoids. Some of the key players operating in the global neuropathic pain market are Depomed Inc. (NASDAQ:DEPO), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), GlaxoSmithKline PLC (NYSE:GSK), Sanofi S.A. (NYSE:SNY), Biogen Idec Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), and Baxter Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:BAX), among others. In the field of myasthenia gravis, pharmaceutical research and development efforts focus on the discovery of a cure for the disease. A cure would make treatment with GTP-004 obsolete. In the field of motion sickness, research may be ongoing for better anti-motion sickness drugs.

  Government Regulation
 
  Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, (including manufacturing changes), quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 U.S. Drug Development Process
 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biological products under the FDCA and the FDA's implementing regulations.
 
 Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 
   ●
 completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations;

   ●
 submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;

   ●
 approval by an independent IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;

   ●
 performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to GCP regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended use;

   ●
 preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;

   ●
 satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's or biologic’s identity, strength, quality, and purity; and

   ●
 FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.


 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates (or those of our collaborators or licensees) will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
 An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical study and places the study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance, and may be imposed on all product candidates within a certain pharmaceutical class. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical studies of a certain duration or for a certain dose.
 
   
20


  
 
 All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical study. Further, an IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical study are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Study sites are subject to inspection for compliance with GCP.
 
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
 Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
   ●
 Phase 1.  The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients.

 
   ●
 Phase 2.  Involves clinical studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.

 
   ●
 Phase 3.  Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.


 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
  U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a new biological drug product, requesting approval to market the product.
 
 The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial application user fee although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for an orphan product or for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees
 
   
21


  
 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, an NDA or BLA application (or supplements to an application) for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral.
 
 In 2012, the FDASIA amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an End-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical studies, and/or other clinical development programs.
 
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 
 The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review to determine whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use.
 
 The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions.
 
 Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure clinical data supporting the submission were developed in compliance with GCP.
 
 The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than an applicant interprets the same data.
 
 After the FDA's evaluation of an application, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing.
 
   
22


  
 
 Even with submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical studies, to further assess safety and effectiveness after approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
  ANDAs and Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or BLA (described above) for innovator products, or an ANDA for generic products. Relevant to ANDAs, the Hatch-Waxman amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs for generic versions of branded drugs previously approved by the FDA (such previously approved drugs are also referred to as listed drugs). Because the safety and efficacy of listed drugs have already been established by the brand company (sometimes referred to as the innovator), the FDA does not require a demonstration of safety and efficacy of generic products. However, a generic manufacturer is typically required to conduct bioequivalence studies of its test product against the listed drug. The bioequivalence studies for orally administered, systemically available drug products assess the rate and extent to which the API is absorbed into the bloodstream from the drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the listed drug. In addition to the bioequivalence data, an ANDA must contain patent certifications and chemistry, manufacturing, labeling and stability data.
 
 The third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA's findings with respect to certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents of the applicant or that are held by third parties whose claims cover the applicant's product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any subsequent applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make one of the following certifications to the FDA concerning patents: (1) the patent information concerning the reference listed drug product has not been submitted to the FDA; (2) any such patent that was filed has expired; (3) the date on which such patent will expire; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a "section viii" statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 
   
23


  
 
 If the reference NDA holder or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. Thus approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
  Post-Approval Requirements
 
 Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping (including certain electronic record and signature requirements), periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of certain adverse experiences, deviations, and other problems with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
 The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
 Manufacturers and certain other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product.
 
 Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an application. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
 The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
   
24


  
 
 Potential implications include required revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 
   ●
 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;

   ●
 warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;

   ●
 refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs/BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;

   ●
 product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or

   ●
 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.


 In addition, the distribution of prescription drugs and biologics is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of the products and product samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidance, and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 
  Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
 In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Some of the additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement levels imposed by third-party payors influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication, or place drugs at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligation imposed on patients. Moreover, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, one payor's determination to provide coverage does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement may differ significantly from payor to payor.
 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
 
 The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our drugs and product candidates from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
 
   
25


  
 
 In addition, we expect that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third-party payors and government authorities to continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
  Employees
 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had five employees. Many of our activities are outsourced to consultants who provide services to us on a project basis. As business activities require and capital resources permit, we will hire additional employees to fulfill our company’s needs.
  
  Form and Year of Organization
 
  In 1965, the corporate predecessor of GT Biopharma, Diagnostic Data, Inc. was incorporated in the State of California. Diagnostic Data changed its incorporation to the State of Delaware in 1972; and changed its name to DDI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 1985. In 1994, DDI Pharmaceuticals merged with International BioClinical, Inc. and Bioxytech S.A. and changed its name to OXIS International, Inc. On July 17, 2017, we amended our Certificate of Incorporation for the purpose of changing our name from Oxis International, Inc. to GT Biopharma, Inc.
 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger
 
  On September 1, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger whereby we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of GTP. GTP is a biotechnology company focused on acquiring or discovering and patenting what it believes to be close-to-market improved treatments for CNS disease (neurology and pain) and shepherding the products through the FDA approval process potentially to NDA. GTP products currently include a treatment for neuropathic pain, the symptoms of myasthenia gravis, and motion sickness. In exchange for the ownership of GTP, we issued a total of 16,927,878 shares of our common stock to the three prior owners of GTP, which represented 33% of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis at the time of closing.
 
  Upon the consummation of the acquisition, Anthony J. Cataldo resigned as our chief executive officer and was simultaneously elected as executive chairman of the board of directors. Kathleen Clarence-Smith, M.D., Ph.D., the founder of GTP, was then elected as our chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors.
 
  As conditions to the acquisition of GTP, (i) we raised $4,540,000 upon the sale of debentures which were subsequently converted into 3,575,109 shares of restricted common stock and 208,224 shares of Series J Preferred Stock to a total of nine persons or entities; (ii) canceled debt in the amount $17,295,352 upon the issuance of 13,712,516 shares of common stock and 700,278 shares of Series J Preferred Stock to a total of 26 persons or entities; (iii) issued 494,911 shares of common stock and 5,046 shares of Series J Preferred Stock upon the cashless exercise of warrants to a total of 22 persons or entities; and (iv) converted 25,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock and 1,666,667 Series I Preferred Stock into 5,327,734 shares of common stock held by a total of three persons or entities. All stock issuances were exempt from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Act of 1933, as amended, or the Act, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Act because the issuances did not involve any public offering.
