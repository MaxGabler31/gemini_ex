Business Development 

The Yippi App is a messaging app with a focus on entertainment and security. It’s fast, simple, secure and free. Yippi seamlessly syncs a user’s normal messages and secret messages into one application. Users can send an unlimited number of messages, photos, and voice messages. Yippi groups allow users to send broadcasts to up to 100 contacts at a time. Users download the Yippi App through the Apple App Store, Google Play, or the Amazon App Store. Revenue is generated from selling advertising, emoji stickers, and special filters, effects and features for use with Yippi. Toga has also generated revenue through the sales of product through a Direct Marketing network to assist in the funding of operations.  This will be temporary as it will assist the Company pay for its ongoing development of the Yippi App.
Yippi App Features

We have developed Yippi as the unique super app that empowers the user with numerous functionalities in a single complete app. The four main elements of the Yippi App are the marketplace, social media, ecosystem, and communication. Since July of 2017, there have been multiple versions launched which have incorporated all four elements.
Marketplace

We see the future in creating a robust ecosystem that is relevant and personalized for the user. Riding on the success of data commerce in large to small scale enterprising techno-preneurs, we are providing a social platform for any user to be involved in customizing their additional plug-ins of choice; from the utility add-ons, games, stickers, themes, skins or contents onto their Yippi social messaging app. This digital content makes up the Marketplace, where the user could obtain free or paid plug-ins from various vendors on a secure micro-transaction platform.

This self-sustaining ecosystem further completes and complements the whole Yippi social messaging app as the daily super app. We believe this concept opens up a whole new level of micro-transactions and a platform for creators to list their digital products and enhancements making them readily available for users.

With this Marketplace, instead of creating and owning every single item of intellectual property on our digital store, we are synergizing the creators and third-parties to create, list their items and engage in sharing of the digital products. This also sets in motion a micro-transaction, as creators could monetize their digital crafts, and diversify their revenue as Marketplace offers them another viable choice away from the existing digital markets.

Our API (Application Protocol Interface) is made available to creators and third-parties upon request, which allows them to develop and test their digital products, features and enhancements before the process of submission the same onto the Marketplace. This allows third party developers to develop applications that interface with the Yippi platform making the Marketplace a more robust destination for app users. This creates an atmosphere of community.

Additionally, physical products within the Marketplace are on a Peer to Peer (P2P) and Business to Consumer (B2C) basis with this feature embedded separately in Yippi Social, as the listing of products are easily available for users to peruse the marketplace to offer their wares. The Marketplace was launched in July 2017 and is in its initial usability stage. 

Wallet

Yippi has a host of built-in shopping functions, which provide access to targeted Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in an ever-expanding variety of shopping experiences. Merchants range from official branded enterprises to budding e-shopping enterprises.

The hotel and flight (TogaGo) feature in Yippi boasts an impressive array of hotel, cruise, and flight partners that enable users to search for the best price for their travel needs. Currently, prices are relatively cheaper and comparable to major travel applications in the market, and with this feature we have bridged these two different applications into one comprehensive application.

These extensions are developed and functioning and are bridged within Yippi with a link to the target platform while the user is still logged into their Yippi account.

Social Media

Yippi Social is fully developed and functioning and is the social media platform embedded within the Yippi social messaging app. Yippi Social incorporates a fully functioning social media timeline as a personal space with integrated functions such as: sharing of updates; following video channels; receiving event invitations; sharing photo and video links and joining groups of interests.

Yippi Social enables users to share their content internally and externally via other platforms (social media or communication apps within their devices) in contrast to WeChat Moments’ or Facebook Timeline’s internal-only sharing capability.

Games

As with most social chat applications that have games bundled onto their app, Yippi has a plethora of simple yet addictive and fun games built in. There are 21 games for the user, with more anticipated to come in the coming months.

We are also anticipating the acquisition of additional games to add to our collection, as well as to cater to a wider gaming audience.

Globally, a large share of gaming revenues are generated from mobile gaming. It is our intention to identify, invest in and partner with up-and-coming developers, which we believe will allow us to compete for additional revenue.

Through the Market Place, we encourage more game studios or independent game producers to package and market their games via this separate platform within Yippi. We believe this would add another significant stream of revenue with its’ own micro-transactions (of free games’ enhancements/add-ons) and game purchases (paid games). As of July 2019, over 20 games were live within the Games section of the Yippi app.

Stickers

Since its release in July 2017, Yippi Stickers is currently functioning and has been packed with pre-loaded stickers that are suitable for any occasion, and these are well organized in their folders for the ease of execution.

We firmly believe with Stickers it opens up a whole new avenue for aspiring graphic designers to create and sell their artwork stickers on our Market Place.

A case study to note is the revenue-generating sticker pioneered by Line chat app, as they achieved tremendous success in generating revenue from their users through affordable e-stickers ever since its inception in 2010 and has steadily been a part of the corporation’s source of income; albeit with extensive competition from other chat apps’ introduction of their own stickers.

We believe Stickers may provide a profitable source of revenue, and we believe with our additional incentive of allowing talented users to trade their digital stickers on our associated Market Place platform, we are just at the tip of the iceberg in the vast potential of stickers in this generational boom.

We are committed in bringing the next evolution of Stickers and in bringing and providing creative creators to share in our technological advances. The Yippi App provides a platform for sticker creations and development, with tutorials and market trends. This may include the next evolution of Motion Stickers, Animated GIFs and cinemographs with snippet of sound/voice and this would further differentiate and modernize all our Yippi Stickers in another level above major sticker competitors. In doing so, we believe we will be able to derive revenue from this this digital product.

Ecosystem

The Company presents the Yippi app to the market as a unique “Super App”, due to the fact that it provides numerous features that creates an ecosystem within the app.

The following have been developed and are currently functioning within the Yippi app: games marketplace (Toga Games). The Company utilizes online and offline aspects to help define and develop the application.

We are actively seeking additional components to add and complement the existing ecosystem in enhancing the user experience and in accordance with the Company’s vision.


7

Yippi Languages

Yippi Languages is an educational tool currently functioning within the application, as we believe in life-long learning by learning languages anytime, anywhere.

Yippi Languages was launched in July 2017 and helps users speaking any of the following ten (10) languages to learn English: Chinese, Hindi, Hmong, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Tagalog, Thai and Vietnamese. 

Yippi Languages features dozens of lessons per supported language and is an invaluable tool for many to access learning modules while adopting another language as a 2nd language with audio guides in speaking natively. Modules also include interactive mini-games to enhance comprehension, and vocabulary which is vital to the learning process.

We are committed to further enhancing this app feature and in providing a comprehensive learning experience to the user. We have engaged third-parties to re-develop an additional UI/UX in making the app responsive and relevant with the trend.

We have engaged researchers to study the probable functionality of it as an e-learning tool for schools as this feature has potential in bringing affordable quick and easy language learning into the school setting or as a language guide incorporated into after-school curriculum.

Artificial Intelligence

A.I.,(artificial intelligence) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning and self-correction.

AI within Yippi was launched in June 2018 with the introduction of Hungry Bear, an AI robot customer service chat box. When a user enters a question in Hungry Bear, the AI chat box will provide immediate answers to the questions.
Communication

Read & Burn 

Reads & Burn is a privacy feature which was launched in July 2017 and currently functions within the chat feature. This feature provides peer-to-peer security in handling private pictures and confidential documents. The pictures and documents sent through Read & Burn are only accessible with touch and then the image disappears from the server and chat history. The pictures and documents cannot be screen-shot by the user’s smartphone.

We included this feature as an enhancement to the experience in Yippi. We believe this feature has its potential in the security of sending private images or confidential documents and provides the users with peace of mind in sending private documents for a single view.

This data will not be stored on smartphones via Yippi nor through peer-to-peer encryption when it is unopened. Through read & burn data is not stored on the servers or in history.

Secret Chat 

In addition to Read & Burn, we developed another version of our chat feature with an enhanced level of security, aptly named, Secret Chat. Launched in January 2017, this feature is a secretive function that self–destructs upon leaving the chat conversation without a record on the application as well as the server. We believe this negates the function of encrypting messages found in other chat apps proving to be a safe chat, virtually un-hackable as it does not have a trace on either servers once our proprietary system purges the chat thread.

Within the chat conversation, the user has almost all of the same functionalities of a regular chat, such as sending images/videos, recording voice messages, sending stickers or gifting eggs.


8

Fun Camera

This trendy and advanced video camera feature allows users to beautify and add animated filters as 3D Face Technology on a video call. Currently in use, this feature is app-exclusive as we developed a number of the filters and augmented reality (AR) skins.

Video calls are made with options to enhance both the caller and recipient with beauty skins, fun stickers, or facial-recognition augmented reality caricatures or cartoons for shared fun experience.

At the time of its launch in April 2018, we believe the number of possible facial enhancements via AR provided by this feature is competitive with the major native camera apps found in Samsung’s and Huawei’s latest flagship smartphones.

Whiteboard

We developed and launched Whiteboard as a unique feature in July 2017. Whiteboard enables users to simultaneously write on the screen display. The users can currently share the same whiteboard with both parties able to write and talk on a single session remotely. 

The voice function has an on/off switch and users could communicate while sketching together on the shared whiteboard.

In addition, the whiteboard could be ‘erased’ by either party at any time to clear the space for another new board for continuous writing. Sharing of info or ideas could be sketched out over the whiteboard or dictated to the other person with ease, rather than the conventional method of writing on a piece of paper before snapping a picture.

This is an excellent feature for sketches and scribbles as it engages a real-time experience, as well as a fun tool for leisure.

Free Chats with Voice & Video Calls

Yippi has embedded and enhanced the quality of Voice & Video Calls for the ease of connectivity to anyone anywhere. We expanded on the functions of our chat application in making the action of contacting friends & family with choices of Text, Voice & Video calls that is parallel with leading chat applications in the market.

Voice & Video quality of calls made via Yippi is clear, and, as with other chat applications, is dependent on network strength. We believe the simplicity of placing a call or a video call will be further enhanced with the advancement of technology and data speed packets as 5G connectivity is upon us.

From its launch in July 2017, Yippi has continued to develop and expand this feature, not just with regards to peer-to-peer calls, but also improving group calls. Group video calls enable a tele-conference from individual smartphones, anytime and anywhere; in line with the ease of communications on the go. Yippi offers a group video call of up to 9 video feeds at the moment. Continued enhancement of to this feature is important to us as we strive to offer the market standard of quality of voice and video calls to our users. 


9

Meeting Room

Meeting Room was launched in January 2017 and is an improvement over the standard group chat feature. The highlight of this feature is the ability to share files and to set a time frame structure for the meeting. The Meeting Room offers additional functions for the administrator to control and facilitate the chat room.

The Meeting Room enables discussions and meetings on subjects within a set time frame and this helps to organize chat groups in order.

We believe this feature has the potential of being a group chat of choice as it allows users to communicate and share files of any type with ease. This is an advantage over other chat apps as most have a limitation on what type of files are shareable, whereas we are giving the user the full sharing capabilities comparable to leading file-sharing apps available. 

We believe this feature could be a trend-setter as the timer in this feature is an advantage to a normal group chat. This frees up a sense of organization of the user’s chat boxes in maintaining and managing their chat conversations.

Forward Voice Message

Since its launch in July of 2017, the Yippi social messaging app enables users to forward voice messages to contacts, as well as group chat recipients. This enhances the sharing possibility of a recorded message as it is equipped in-app for the ease and functionality of the user.

In addition, with our propriety enhancement of built-in translation (and voice recognition); the user may use the option to translate received voice message from a selection of spoken languages.

People Nearby

With its launch in July of 2017, users can use this feature to seek out other Yippi users within their immediate area to communicate and network, or chat for leisure.

Yippi users can arrange a meeting and make new friends, or seek out business opportunities by networking through this feature. With the impending official brand accounts, we could evolve this further with geo-location push notification on promotions and offers for Yippi user that switches their People Nearby feature. Currently there are no brand accounts.

With respect to all of the features and functionalities of the Yippi App, we are looking at trends and opportunities to enhance the apps features and functionalities and to add new features. 

The markets for our Yippi App are characterized by rapid technological change, particularly in the technical capabilities of smartphones and tablets, and changing end-user preferences. Therefore, we will be required to continuously invest capital to innovate and modify our Yippi App and publish new apps. We cannot assure that we will have adequate capital to modify our Yippi App or develop new apps.

However, our ability to plan for further development of the Yippi App, distribution and promotional activities will be significantly affected by our ability to anticipate and adapt to relatively rapid changes in the tastes and preferences of our current and potential users. New and different types of entertainment may increase in popularity at the expense of mobile apps. A decline in the popularity of apps in general, or our Yippi App in particular, would harm our business and prospects. We may not be successful in developing additional features and functionality for the Yippi App.

Marketing Strategy

As of July 31, 2019 we had approximately 57,329 daily active users and approximately 305,297 monthly active users of our Yippi App. As of October 31, 2019 we had approximately 90,578 daily active users and approximately 409,222 monthly active user. We define a daily active user as a registered user of the Yippi App who opens the app at least once during a 24-hour period and monthly active user as a registered user of the Yippi App who opens the app at least once during a 30-day period.

We have outlined the following plans in our effort to achieve or targets described below. We believe this is in line with our vision and mission statement in being a pioneer of the Big Data industry and in creating a sustainable system in initiating the support for the targeted 2,000,000 SMEs projected to use our platforms in expanding their business and culture of data-marketing. In an effort to achieve our goal of 500 million Active Users, and the preceding downloads, we have created a 6 vertical marketing strategy we call the 6 User Channels.


10


This 6 User Channels cover the basis of our group marketing effort globally with its own timeline in activity of different regions globally, with the selection based on our research and details. There can be no assurance that all or any of our planned marketing activities will be implemented, or, in the event any or all of such planned marketing activities are implemented that they will be successful.

We believe that with the rise of affordable smartphones and efforts in bridging the internet to the disadvantaged, the potential market to expand the user base is exponential in the near future.

We are currently concentrating our efforts on the following 6 User Channels:

2. Publicity & Campaigns

A series of brand awareness and marketing campaign in promoting Yippi to the target market as a unique super app. We have engaged branding consultants in selected countries in marketing Yippi digitally.

Campaigns are set to launch until the end of the year in Indonesia and the Philippines as well as corporate branding on social media and an internet presence.

3. Games & Contests

We published our game, Duck Wanted on July 2018, and the response has been positive with daily scoreboards and rewards in attracting more players in this engaging game. At the time of print, we are working on other genre of games for the release soon and building on the momentum.

We started an on-going contests campaign since May 2018 via Yippi Social, with Share/Comment contests on a weekly basis. The contest gambit encompasses questions, quiz, personal preferences, favorite pictures among others in engaging users/followers to participate by commenting and sharing on their Social walls. The winners were picked based on the criteria of most creative, most shares or most ‘likes’ earned.

4. Mini-Programs

Mini-Programs are “sub-applications” within our Yippi ecosystem, and it enables advanced features to users in e-commerce, task management, coupons/offers, brand page or exclusive content from official accounts.

These enhancements provide experiences that are built completely within Yippi, for a complete user experience.

Mini-Programs are similar to apps but as it is within Yippi, accessing it won’t take up any storage space on the user’s device. Users may scan QR codes or input the names of the mini-programs in-app to launch them. The campaign to encourage talented independent developers to create mini-programs onto /and powered by our Marketplace is vital in the success of the mini-programs and thus complements our ecosystem in the near future.

5. Languages

Toga strongly believes in making a difference to those in need and this channel is seen as a corporate social responsibility in the area of offering users Yippi as an English learning app. Presently, and since its launch in July 2017, Languages’ education module is designed to teach English to users from ten (10) different native languages, including Chinese, Hindi and Indonesian.

The Company also intends to target potential users of the Yippi App in the United States.

12

Advertising

We compete for advertising revenue, especially with respect to video and other highly engaging formats. We believe our ability to compete depends primarily on our reach and ability to deliver a strong return on investment to our advertisers, which is driven by our advertising products, delivery and measurement capabilities, APIs, and other tools. The industry in which we operate is changing rapidly and we find ourselves in competition with internet-based platforms, advertising networks, and traditional media.
Competition

We compete with other companies in every aspect of our business, particularly with companies that focus on mobile engagement and advertising. Many of these companies, such as Apple, Facebook (including Instagram and WhatsApp), Tencent (including WeChat), Snap Inc. (Snapchat), Google (including YouTube), and Twitter, have significantly greater financial and human resources. Our competitors span from internet technology companies and digital platforms to traditional companies in print, radio, and television sectors to underlying technologies like default smartphone messaging. Additionally, our competition for engagement varies by region. The main bases on which we currently compete with competitors include engagement, partnerships, advertising, and talent.

We compete to attract and retain our users’ attention, both in terms of reach and engagement. Since our Yippi App and apps of our competitors are typically free, we compete based on our brand and the quality of our app and any potential future product offerings rather than on price. We focus on constantly improving and expanding the Yippi App and related features.

Toga Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
July 31, 2019

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Business description

On June 30, 2016, Blink Couture, Inc. entered into a merger agreement with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Toga Limited (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation with no material operations. The Company continued operations under the name Toga Limited.

Blink Couture, Inc. was originally incorporated as Fashionfreakz International Inc. on October 23, 2003, under the laws of the State of Delaware. On December 2, 2005, Fashionfreakz International Inc. changed its name to Blink Couture Inc. Until March 4, 2008, the Company’s principal business was the online retail marketing of trendy clothing and accessories produced by independent designers. On March 4, 2008, the Company discontinued its prior business and changed its business plan. On June 13, 2016, a change of control of the Company occurred. On that date, the current president and Chief Executive Officer purchased a total of 13,869,150 of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company.

On June 10, 2017, the Board of Directors unanimously adopted resolutions authorizing the increase of the Company’s authorized number of shares of common stock from one hundred million (100,000,000) shares to ten billion (10,000,000,000) shares and increased the number of the Company’s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock by conducting a forward split at the rate of fifty (50) shares for every one (1) (50:1) share currently issued and outstanding (the “Forward Split”). The Forward Split became effective in the market on September 11, 2017 following approval by the FINRA. All share amounts in this filing have been adjusted retroactively.

The Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, TOGL Technology Sdn. Bhd. (“TOGL”) in Malaysia on September 26, 2017.

On May 28, 2018, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary TOGL formed a branch office in Taiwan.

The Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, PT. Toga International Indonesia (“PT Toga”) in Indonesia on November 23, 2017.

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary TOGL formed a wholly-owned subsidiary Toga Vietnam Company Limited (“Toga Vietnam”) in Vietnam on January 15, 2019, acquired 100% shares of WGS Discovery Tours & Travel in Malaysia on June 24, 2019 and acquired 67% of the shares in PT TOGL Technology Indonesia in Indonesia on May 24, 2019. 

On May 8, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby it amended Article IV of its Articles of Incorporation by decreasing the Company’s authorized number of shares of common stock from ten billion (10,000,000,000) shares to one billion (1,000,000,000) shares and decreasing its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of ten (10) shares for every one (1) share held (“10-1 Reverse Split”). The Company’s Board of Directors approved this amendment on April 24, 2019.

On May 17, 2019, the Company filed an Issuer Company-Related Action Notification Form with FINRA requesting that the 10-1 Reverse-Split and share decrease be effected in the market. All share and per share information in these consolidated financial statements retroactively reflect this stock distribution.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and has adopted a July 31 fiscal year end. 
Basis of Consolidation

These consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the wholly-owned subsidiaries, TOGL Technology Sdn. Bhd., and PT. Toga International Indonesia. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. TOGL Technology incorporates the financial statements of the Taiwan and Vietnam office.
Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of less than ninety days at the date of purchase.

Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share

Pursuant to the authoritative guidance, basic net income and net loss per share are computed by dividing the net income and net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income and net loss per share is the same as basic net income and net loss per share when their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect due to our continuing net losses. 

As at July 31, 2019, the Company has potentially 120,000 dilutive securities from outstanding stock options, which were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per common share as the result of the computation was anti-dilutive.

Software Development

The Company accounts for all software and development costs in accordance with ASC 985-20 – Software. Accordingly, all costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility have been expensed. As of July 31, 2019, none of the costs subsequent to technological feasibility associated with software and development met the criteria for capitalization.
Inventories

Inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method.

No reserves are considered necessary for slow moving or obsolete inventory as inventory on hand at year-end was purchased near the end of the year. The Company continuously evaluates the adequacy of these reserves and makes adjustments to these reserves as required.

As of July 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had inventories of $162,985 and $NIL, respectively.


28

Equipment and Furniture

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method. The depreciation and amortization methods are designed to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives, in years, of the respective assets as follows:

Building | 20 years 
-----------------------+-------------
Renovation | 3 to 5 years
Fixtures and Furniture | 4 to 5 years
Tools and Equipment | 4 to 5 years
Vehicles | 3 to 5 years
Computer Equipment | 4 to 5 years


Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Improvements of a major nature are capitalized. At the time of retirement or other disposition of property and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gains or losses are reflected in income.

The long-lived assets of the Company are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment” (“ASC 360”), whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. During the years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, no impairment losses have been identified.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets – digital currency

We account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350 “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other” (“ASC 350”). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. In addition, ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests when circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill may be in doubt. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units; assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions or the occurrence of one or more confirming events in future periods could cause the actual results or outcomes to materially differ from such estimates and could also affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment at future reporting dates.

On June 24, 2019, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary TOGL acquired 100% shares of WGS Discovery Tours & Travel in Malaysia, which generated Goodwill of $11,718. The Company has accounted for transaction in accordance with ASC 805 “Business Combinations.”

Based on the Company’s analysis of goodwill as of July 31, 2019, no indicators of impairment exist. No impairment loss on goodwill was recognized for the year ended July 31, 2019.

Foreign Currency Translations

The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Our subsidiary’s functional currency is the Malaysian ringgit. All transactions initiated in Malaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar and Vietnamese dong, and Indonesian rupiah are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830-30, ”Translation of Financial Statements,” as follows:


1) | Monetary assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Equity at historical rates. 
3) | Revenue and expense items at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period. 


29


Adjustments arising from such translations are deferred until realization and are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity as a component of comprehensive income or loss. Therefore, translation adjustments are not included in determining net income (loss) but reported as other comprehensive income. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings in the period of settlement.

Stock-based Compensation

We account for stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant, and recognize compensation over the service-period that they are expected to vest. We estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated value of the portion of a stock-based award that is ultimately expected to vest, taking into consideration estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time, of other comparative securities, equal to the weighted average life of the options. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures, such differences are accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised. 

Stock-based compensation incurred for the year ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are summarized as follows:


 | Year Ended |

Fair Value

FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”) establishes a framework for all fair value measurements and expands disclosures related to fair value measurement and developments. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

ASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

Level 1—Quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable inputs;

Level 2—Significant other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data; and

Level 3—Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data.

The carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable and other liabilities, accrued interest payable, and convertible notes approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.
Related Party Balances and Transactions

The Company follows FASB ASC 850, “Related Party Disclosures,” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transaction. (See Note 5)

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is established when management considers it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as incurred as a component of income tax expense. The Company has not recognized any tax benefits from uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented.

Revenue Recognition

In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the Standard is that recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new guidance requires that companies disclose the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company has chosen to early adopt and apply the standards beginning in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, which applies the new standard to contracts that are not completed as of the date of adoption. The Company concluded that no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was required upon the adoption of the new standard.

The Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenues when satisfying the performance obligation of the associated contract that reflects the consideration expected to be received based on the terms of the contract.


31


Revenue related to contracts with customers is evaluated utilizing the following steps: (i) Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer; (ii) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) Determine the transaction price; (iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (v) Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

When the Company enters into a contract, the Company analyzes the services required in the contract in order to identify the required performance obligations which would indicate the Company has met and fulfilled its obligations. For the current contracts in place, the Company has identified performance obligations as agreement from both parties (implicit or explicit) that the obligations have been met. To appropriately identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all of the services required to be satisfied per the contract, whether explicitly stated or implicitly implied. The Company allocates the full transaction price to the single performance obligation being satisfied.

The Company recognizes revenue when the customer confirms to the Company that all of the terms and conditions of the contract has been met. The Company derives its revenues from the following:


- | advertising using a custom-built advertising feature that matches client advertising requirements (approximately $0.4 million)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | management fees and information technology fees (approximately $1.4 million) 
- | sale of products through a direct marketing network (approximately $7.1 million) 


The Company analyses whether gross sales, or net sales should be recorded, has control over establishing price, and has control over the related costs with earning revenues. The Company has recorded all revenues at the gross price.

Cash payments received are recorded as deferred revenue until the conditions, stated above, of revenue recognition have been met, specifically all obligations have been met as specified in the related customer contract.

Concentration of Revenue by Customer

The Company’s concentration of revenue for individual customers above 10% are as follows:


· | Agel Enterprise International Sdn Bhd: 14%,
--+--------------------------------------------
· | Others: 85% 


Concentration of Revenue by Country:


- | Malaysia (TOGL Technology Sdn. Bhd): 34% 
--+--------------------------------------------------
- | Indonesia (PT. Toga International Indonesia): 63%
- | United States (Toga Limited): 3% 


The Company attributes revenue from external customers to individual countries based upon the responsibility of the entity to fulfil the sales obligation and the entity from which the actual service is provided.

Accounts Receivable

The Company’s accounts receivable balance is related to advertising through TOGL. Accounts receivable are recorded in accordance with ASC 310, “Receivables.” Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company does not currently have any amount recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on management’s estimate and based on all accounts being current, the Company has not deemed it necessary to reserve for doubtful accounts at this time.

As of July 31, 2019, the Company’s accounts receivable are concentrated 70% with Agel Enterprise International Sdn Bhd.

As of July 31, 2019, the Company’s accounts receivable are concentrated 93% in Malaysia (TOGL Technology Sdn. Bhd) and 7% in United States (Toga Limited).

Research and Development Expenses

We follow ASC 730, “Research and Development,” and expense research and development costs when incurred. Accordingly, third-party research and development costs, including designing, prototyping and testing of product, are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or milestone results have been achieved. Indirect costs are allocated based on percentage usage related to the research and development.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, “Leases” (“ASC 842”). The guidance requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Existing sale-leaseback guidance, including guidance for real estate, is replaced with a new model applicable to both lessees and lessors. ASC 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the adoption of ASC 842, but has not determined the effects it may have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-08 “Collaborative Arrangements” (Topic 808) intended to improve financial reporting around collaborative arrangements and align the current guidance under ASC 808 with ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” The ASU affects all companies that enter into collaborative arrangements. The ASU clarifies when certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted for as revenue under Topic 606 and changes certain presentation requirements for transactions with a collaborative arrangement participants that are not directly related to sales to third parties. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods therein. Earlier adoption is permitted for any annual or interim period for which consolidated financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company has not entered into any collaborative arrangements and therefore does not currently expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company plans to adopt this ASU either on the effective date of January 1, 2020 or possibly in an earlier period if a collaborative arrangement is entered. Upon adoption, the Company will utilize the retrospective transition approach, as prescribed within this ASU.

The Company has reviewed and analyzed the above recent accounting pronouncements and notes no material impact on the financial statements as of July 31, 2019.

NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES

The Company recognizes deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company has not incurred any income tax liabilities due to accumulated net losses. We operate in various tax jurisdictions, and accordingly, our income is subject to varying rates of tax.

For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, no taxable income was generated. All tax years since inception are open for review. The Company had a net loss of $9,800,520 for the year ended July 31, 2019 and $13,620,308 for the same period in 2018. As of July 31, 2019, the Company’s net operating loss carry forward was approximately $3,000,000, which will begin to expire in year 2036.

On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) resulting in significant modifications to existing law.
