When team members feel connected to our mission and are listened to, cared for, and respected at an extraordinary level, they produce outstanding work, which enables our customers to measurably improve. As customers realize improvements, their trust in Health Catalyst builds, their engagement in our shared work increases, and they choose to renew and expand their relationship with us, while also referring Health Catalyst to key decision-makers at other potential customers. Customer renewal, expansion, and referral produce growing, scalable, and predictable financial performance.
The cycle described above creates momentum for our business and is encapsulated in the following diagram:
Given the central importance of team member engagement to our company’s long-term success, we have been purposeful in defining and emphasizing operating principles and cultural attributes that reinforce the commitment to our mission and to team member engagement. We consistently focus on our operating principles and cultural attributes, as well as our mission and Flywheel (collectively, the Health Catalyst Way), which we review in all new hire orientations, company-wide meetings, and board of directors’ meetings. Furthermore, we regularly measure our team member engagement and adjust our practices based on team member feedback. We have demonstrated an elite, consistent level of team member engagement over time as demonstrated by a 95th to 99th percentile ranking by Gallup.

The unique combination of talent and experience across healthcare and technology, as well as our management team’s commitment to the Health Catalyst Way, underpin everything we do.
Our Growth Strategies
Our growth strategies reflect our mission to be the catalyst for massive, measurable, data-informed healthcare improvement. Our focus on multiple channels, as well as our collaborative company culture, results in high levels of sustainable growth. Our strategic levers to drive growth include:
•Grow our overall customer base. We have a substantial opportunity to continue growing our customer base through our active sales and marketing strategy and significant word-of-mouth references. We currently estimate our total core addressable market to include more than 1,200 healthcare organizations, including health systems and risk-bearing entities. We believe there is ample room to win new business and deepen market penetration in our core market. Further, healthcare providers outside of the United States face similar challenges to those in the United States and can implement our Solution to address them. We plan to opportunistically pursue international markets by expanding our business in the United Kingdom, Canada, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East.
•Expand within our current customer base. We intend to deepen and expand the relationships we have with our existing customer base. Our relationship with a new customer oftentimes starts through the use of targeted analytics applications and services to pinpoint and achieve a single measurable clinical, financial, or operational improvement. As we deliver measurable improvements, trust builds, and our customers engage with us more broadly and purchase additional applications and services. We have achieved continued DOS Subscription customer growth in part due to strong customer retention and customer referrals. This is evidenced by our positive Dollar-based Retention Rates of 112%, 102%, and 109% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We will continue to invest in helping customers identify additional uses for our Solution, ensuring they achieve measurable improvements throughout our relationship with them.
•Add new analytics applications and services offerings. The expansion of our Solution and enhancement of our applications library will accelerate as we deepen our customer relationships and add to our dataset. Because our platform is open and we partner with our customers, we are able to identify new opportunities for further improvements and leverage that insight with other customers across our core market to develop new analytics applications and services offerings. We have used this process to build several new software applications through our history, and we will continue to invest in product development, particularly at the analytics applications layer of our technology stack.
•Grow our addressable market through additional healthcare business segment adjacencies. We believe there are significant applications for our Solution outside of our core market, as evidenced by our early efforts to expand into the life sciences market and certain international markets. While we believe there are significant opportunities in our core market, these business segment agencies have the potential to significantly grow our addressable market and business over time.
•Selectively pursue acquisitions and partnerships. We plan to continue evaluating and identifying opportunities where we can leverage our platform to scale and consolidate both data assets and best-of-breed applications. We believe that competing point solutions vendors will have difficulty in growing their offerings into sustainable businesses, which we believe translates into a robust mergers and acquisitions pipeline for us. We have a track record of identifying and integrating new and complementary capabilities, including our acquisitions of Healthcare Data Works, Medicity, Able Health, Healthfinch, Vitalware, and Twistle. Moreover, we believe the companies we partner with and acquire choose us because of our collaborative, best-in-class culture which we view as a differentiating factor in sourcing acquisitions and partnerships.
Our Solution
Our Solution empowers our customers to run a data-informed business. Our healthcare-specific, open, flexible, scalable and self-service data platform, advanced analytics applications, and services expertise guide our customers to greater levels of digital maturity, enabling clinical, financial, and operational improvements. The diagram below illustrates the three layers of our comprehensive Solution.
Data and analytics platform - the Data Operating System (DOS)
DOS is a healthcare-specific, open, flexible, scalable and self-service data and analytics platform that allows customers to integrate and organize their disparate data sources to enable insights across clinical, financial, and operational objectives. It serves as a digital backbone, allowing customers to extract data from transactional source systems, combine disparate data sets into a unified source of truth and query the dataset directly. DOS is a cloud-based technology that we primarily provide through Microsoft Azure. In order to enable more advanced feature development and functionality, we are in the process of migrating the small number of remaining on-premise DOS customers to Microsoft Azure.
DOS has been uniquely designed and purpose-built to handle the complex, ever-evolving nature of healthcare-specific data and analytics. This includes healthcare-specific terminology, data governance, meta-data management, and analytics. By creating healthcare-specific data models to organize industry-specific data, we enable faster and more repeatable analytics and insights. We have developed the capabilities to turn these insights into actions by connecting our analytics into the workflow systems, such as an electronic health record (EHR).
Differentiating attributes of our DOS include:
•Data Warehouse. We believe our innovative architecture has a proven track record of agility and adaptability to new rules, vocabularies, and data content. Our open and self-service platform enables database-level querying and custom analytics use-cases.
•Source Connectors. Our platform is designed to quickly ingest data from the numerous systems and siloed data sources our customers possess. We have prebuilt connectors to the most common transactional software systems used by healthcare organizations. The DOS data management console enables customers to manage robust ETL processes and scheduling.

•level of customer satisfaction;
•ease of deployment and use of solutions and applications;
•breadth and depth of solution and application functionality;
•access to, and ability to glean insights from, large data sets;
•brand awareness and reputation;
•modern and adaptive technology platform;
•capability for customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability, and reliability of applications;
•total cost of ownership;
•ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
•size of customer base and level of user adoption;
•regulatory compliance verification and functionality;
•domain expertise with respect to healthcare; and
•ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications.
We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, and other resources and name recognition than we do and more established distribution networks and relationships with healthcare providers. As a result, many of these companies may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards and changes in customer requirements. These companies may be able to invest more resources in research and development, strategic acquisitions, sales and marketing, patent prosecution, litigation, and financing capital equipment acquisitions for their customers.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive, complex, and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations. Various federal and state agencies have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce healthcare laws. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and interpretation of existing laws and regulations may change periodically. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business. The following are summaries of key federal and state laws and regulations that impact our operations:
Government regulation of health-related and other personal information
In the United States, numerous state and federal laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our customers. 
For example, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations implemented thereunder (collectively, HIPAA) impose obligations on “covered entities,” including certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information (PHI) for or on behalf of such covered entities, as well as their covered subcontractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of PHI. 
Since we provide services that require us to use and disclose PHI on behalf of our covered entity customers, we are a business associate. Our covered entity customers are required under HIPAA to enter into business associate agreements (BAAs) with us and we are required to enter into BAAs with our downstream subcontractors that access or otherwise process PHI on our behalf. As a business associate, we are required to comply with the HIPAA security standards, and certain provisions of the HIPAA privacy standards and breach notification rule, and may be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so. 
In addition to HIPAA, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, including privacy safeguards, and security standards. Many states have also adopted data security breach notification requirements. Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we must comply with them. In addition, certain states have adopted other laws governing the use and disclosure of personal information. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) was recently voted into law by California residents. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA, and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and become enforceable on July 1, 2023. Similar laws have passed in Virginia and Colorado, and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The enactment of such laws could have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging.
Federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the FTC, Federal Communications Commission and states’ attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or patient information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content and to regulate direct marketing, including telemarketing and telephonic communication. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security, and access.
Fraud, waste, and abuse
Even though we do not directly order or provide healthcare services that are reimbursable by Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors or submit claims or receive reimbursement from any such payor, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud, abuse and waste apply or may apply to our business and to the financial arrangements through which we market, sell and provide our services to our healthcare provider customers. These laws and regulations include or may include the following:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for, or intended to induce or reward, including arranging for or recommending, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, prescription, or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid program. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.
•The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws impose criminal and civil penalties and authorizes civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to a federal government healthcare program, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; making, using or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to payment of a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government has prosecuted revenue cycle management service providers for causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims in violation of the FCA. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Moreover, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.
•HIPAA also contains a provision that imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program (including private payors) or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Similarly, the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
In addition, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes and regulations that apply regardless of the payor, including commercial payors and self-pay patients. Violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including significant penalties, fines, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight under a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, imprisonment and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. 
Corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting laws
In many states, there are laws that that prohibit business entities, such as us, from providing professional medical services or directly employing or otherwise exercising control over professional judgment or medical decisions by physicians or other licensed health care professionals (such activities generally referred to as the “corporate practice of medicine”). Corporate practice of medicine regulations and other similar laws may also prevent fee-splitting, or the sharing of professional service income with non-professional or business interests. Overseeing a care coordination or care management team could be alleged in some cases to involve treatment or diagnosis of patients which requires a clinic license or other state license or permission. Any determination that we are acting in the capacity of a healthcare provider and acting improperly as a healthcare provider, exercising undue influence or control over a healthcare provider or impermissibly sharing fees with a healthcare provider, may result in additional compliance requirements, expense, and liability to us, and require us to change or terminate some portions of our contractual arrangements or business.
Patient safety organization certification and other certification requirements
Our patient safety organization (PSO) is certified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). We must meet certain requirements to maintain this certification. In addition, there may be other federal and state certification requirements that we may be required to meet from time to time in connection with our Solution. We cannot be certain that our Solution will continue to meet these standards. The failure to comply with these certification requirements could result in the loss of certification.
Interoperability Standards. ONC is charged under the 21st Century Cures Act with developing a Trusted Exchange Framework that establishes governance requirements for trusted health information exchange in the United States. ONC has developed the U.S. Common Data Set for Interoperability which may lay the groundwork for future data exchange requirements for trusted exchange. ONC continues to modify and refine these standards. We may incur increased software development and administrative expense and delays in delivering technology and services if we need to update our services to conform to these varying and evolving requirements. In addition, delays in interpreting these standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our clients’ decisions to purchase our services. If our services are not compliant with these evolving standards, our market position and sales could be impaired, and we may have to invest significantly in changes to our technology and services.
The 21st Century Cures Act includes provisions related to data interoperability, information blocking, and patient access. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) recently issued final rules related to these provisions, which include, among other things, requirements surrounding information blocking, changes to ONC's Health IT Certification Program and requirements that CMS-regulated payors make relevant claims/care data and provider directory information available through standardized patient access and provider directory application programming interfaces (APIs) that connect to provider electronic health records. Any failure to adequately comply with these rules may adversely impact our business and our ability to compete.
In a regulatory climate that is uncertain, our operations may be subject to direct and indirect adoption, expansion or reinterpretation of various federal and state laws and regulations. Compliance with these amended and/or future laws and regulations may require us to change our practices at an undeterminable and possibly significant initial monetary and annual expense. There could be laws and regulations applicable to our business that we have not identified or that, if changed, may apply to our business operations. Additionally, the introduction of new services may require us to comply with additional, yet undetermined, laws and regulations.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
The FDA regulates medical or health-related software, including machine learning functionality and predictive algorithms, if such software falls within the definition of a “medical device” under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and by other federal, state and local authorities. The FDCA and related regulations govern the conditions of safety, efficacy, clearance, approval, manufacturing, quality system requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of medical devices. However, historically, the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion for certain low-risk software functions, and has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to the regulation of software as a medical device. In addition, FDCA excludes certain types of software from the definition of a medical device, including certain medical-related software, including software used for administrative support functions at a healthcare facility, software intended for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle, software designed to store electronic health records, software for transferring, storing, or displaying medical device data or in vitro diagnostic data, and certain clinical decision support software. Accordingly, we believe our currently marketed products are not currently regulated by the FDA as medical devices, or are otherwise subject to FDA’s current enforcement discretion policies.
FDA premarket clearance and approval requirements - Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (QSR), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. 
While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. 
Postmarket regulation - After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•complying with requirements governing Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database;
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Manufacturers of medical device products marketed in the United States are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. Device manufacturers are also subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. 
If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including a determination that our software products require prior FDA clearance or approval to be legally marketed in the United States, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions: warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or criminal prosecution.
Foreign regulations
Our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates are subject to additional regulations by the Government of the United Kingdom, as well as its subdivisions, the Government of Singapore, and the Government of the United Arab Emirates, respectively. These include federal and local corporation requirements, restrictions on exchange of funds, employment-related laws and qualification for tax status.
Foreign data collection. The collection and use of personal health data in the European Economic Area (EEA) is governed by various laws concerning privacy, data protection and data security, most notably the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR). The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA as well as to those outside the EEA if they collect and use personal data in connection with offering goods or services to individuals in the EEA or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on services providers. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA to other countries, including the United States; in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States by invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses, which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the EEA. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The GDPR may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with data protection rules. In addition, member states of the EEA may impose further obligations relating to the processing of health data, which could further add to our compliance costs and limit how we process this information. From January 1, 2021, we may be subject to the GDPR and also the United Kingdom (UK) GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g. fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the UK and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how the UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated in the long term. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the UK, enabling data transfers from European Union member states to the UK without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews or extends that decision. We also may become subject to similar laws and regulations in other countries outside of the EEA in which we do business. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and foreign anti-bribery laws. The FCPA makes it illegal for U.S. persons, including U.S. companies, and their subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, and agents, to promise, authorize or make any corrupt payment, or otherwise provide any item of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official or any foreign political party or party official to obtain or retain business. Violations of the FCPA can also result in violations of other U.S. laws, including anti-money laundering, mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy laws. There are severe penalties for violating the FCPA. In addition, the Company may also be subject to other non-U.S. anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010.
Export controls. Economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by OFAC prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, and dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries, and other sanctioned persons, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Further, federal regulations impose authorization, reporting, and/or licensing requirements prior to the export of certain software that incorporates encryption technology. These requirements may apply to our Solution to the extent that our software with encryption functionality is implemented abroad or is hosted on servers in a foreign country to provide services to customers outside the United States. In addition, various countries also regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our customers’ ability to import our technology into those countries.

Human Capital Management
At the center of the Flywheel described above is the engagement of our team members. Team member engagement is foundational to everything we do and is the #1 priority of our CEO and broader leadership team. When team members feel connected to our mission and are listened to, cared for, and respected at an extraordinary level, they produce outstanding work, which enables our customers to measurably improve. As customers realize improvements, their trust in Health Catalyst builds, their engagement in our shared work increases, and they choose to renew and expand their relationship with us, while also referring Health Catalyst to key decision-makers at other potential customers. Customer renewal, expansion, and referral produce growing, scalable, and predictable financial performance.
Our key human capital management objectives include, among others: (i) attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse and talented workforce; (ii) providing opportunities for learning, development, career growth, and movement within Health Catalyst; (iii) evaluating compensation and benefits, and rewarding performance; (iv) investing in physical, emotional, and financial health of team members; (v) obtaining team member feedback; (vi) maintaining and enhancing our culture and mission; and (vii) communicating with our board of directors on a routine basis on key topics. We have implemented and continue to develop many programs designed to achieve these priorities, some of which are further described below. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 1,200 team members, almost all of whom are located in the United States. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our team member relations to be good. We encourage you to review the Environmental, Social and Governance scorecard found on our website at https://ir.healthcatalyst.com/esg/overview (ESG Website) for more detailed information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Team member engagement
We regularly engage with our team members to assess their job satisfaction, including conducting regular team member surveys and hosting monthly all team member meetings in which leadership answers questions from team members. We use information from these sources, among others, to improve our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented team members who will help advance our mission. 
Compensation, benefits and wellness 
In addition to market-competitive base pay, short-term bonus incentives, and long-term equity incentives, we provide comprehensive team member benefits and a variety of other health and wellness resources. We are committed to fair compensation and opportunity in our workplace.
Pay equity
We are committed to ensuring our team members receive equal pay for equal work. We establish components and ranges of compensation based on market and benchmark data. Within this context, we strive to pay all employees equitably within a reasonable range, taking into consideration factors such as role; market data; internal equity; job location; relevant experience; and individual, business unit, and company performance, among others. We regularly review our compensation practices and analyze the equity of compensation decisions. We institute measures, such as communications and trainings, to recognize, interrupt and prevent bias in hiring, performance management, and compensation decisions and we provide resources to further develop managers and leaders to help them make equitable decisions about pay.
Diversity and inclusion 
We are committed to fostering a culture of inclusion and belonging, and to building a diverse workforce to drive innovation and collective growth, which we believe is critical to our success. We continue to formalize and invest in our diversity and inclusion initiatives as further described on the ESG website listed above. These diversity and inclusion efforts – spearheaded by our Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer and our five affinity groups in partnership with hundreds of our team members – focus on diversity and inclusion in our workforce, in our workplace and in healthcare. We continue to focus upon inclusive recruitment and hiring practices to source diverse talent and mitigate potential bias throughout the hiring process, including expanding our internship program to include remote workplace options, attending diversity conferences and job fairs. Our Shades affinity group for team members of color contributes to the marketing and design of our AI driven Health Equity Assessment and Guidance Solution to overcome disparities in care in the healthcare ecosystem. Over the past year, we continued to expand our diversity training for our team members with the creation and launch of our Diversity Dialogue Series, which included outside speakers.
Growth and development
We invest significant resources to develop talent and actively foster a learning culture where team members are empowered to drive their personal and professional growth. We offer extensive onboarding and regular training programs to prepare our team members at all levels for career progression and individual development. We also offer annual continuing education reimbursement to allow team members to be continuous learners and seek new challenges.
Flexible work environment
We help our team members succeed by providing flexibility in where and how they work. For many years, we have enabled team members to have flexible work arrangements, including a large percentage of remote team members. We believe these arrangements can increase team member’s ownership, satisfaction and productivity, as well as enable us to hire from a broader, more diverse pool of talent. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we allowed all team members to be remote to protect the health, safety and wellness of our team members. We continue to support our workforce with the technology and infrastructure necessary to work from a remote location, including a work equipment and utilities reimbursement program to help our team member improve their dynamic workspaces.
