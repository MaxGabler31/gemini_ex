ITEM 1: BUSINESS 
Overview
eBay Inc. was formed as a sole proprietorship in September 1995 and was incorporated in California in May 1996. In April 1998, we reincorporated in Delaware, and in September 1998, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our principal executive offices are located at 2025 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California, 95125, and our telephone number is (408) 376-7008. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, when we refer to “we,” “our,” “us,” or “eBay” in this annual report on Form 10-K, we mean eBay Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
eBay is a global commerce leader through our Marketplace platforms which connect millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world. The platforms include our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its localized counterparts, including off-platform businesses in Japan and Turkey, as well as eBay’s suite of mobile apps. Our platforms are accessible through an online experience (e.g. desktop and laptop computers), iOS and Android mobile devices (e.g. smartphones and tablets) and our application programming interfaces (“APIs,” platform access for third party software developers).
Notably, on June 24 , 2021, we completed the sale of our Classifieds business to Adevinta ASA (“Adevinta”) for $2.5 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments, and 540 million Adevinta shares, and on November 18, 2021, eBay completed the sale of approximately 135 million shares of Adevinta to Astinlux Finco S.a.r.l. (“Permira”) for approximately $2.3 billion in cash. Further, on November 14, 2021, we completed the sale of 80.01% of our ownership stake in eBay Korea LLC to E-mart Inc. (“Emart”) for approximately $3.0 billion of gross cash proceeds subject to certain adjustments.
Our Strategy
As a global commerce leader and third-party marketplace, our technologies and services are designed to provide buyers choice and a breadth of relevant inventory from around the globe, and to enable sellers’ access to eBay’s 147 million buyers worldwide. Our business model and pricing are designed so that our business is successful when our sellers are successful. We earn revenue primarily through fees collected on paid sales, payment processing and first-party advertising. 
eBay’s strategy is to leverage technology to enhance the marketplace experience for our customers to drive growth in Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”), while increasing the rate of revenue growth through our managed payments and advertising initiatives and delivering healthy operating margins. In 2020, we embarked on a multi-year journey to build more compelling category experiences for enthusiastic consumers, to become the partner of choice for sellers and to strengthen trust in relationships with buyers on our platforms. We derived a majority of GMV in 2021 from the following product categories — parts & accessories, consumer electronics and home & garden.
During 2021, we completed the migration of eBay’s managed payments in all markets, delivering buyers and sellers a simplified end-to-end payments experience. Through managed payments, we are able to provide a frictionless experience for current and next-generation customers, consistent with today’s retail standards. We offer buyers more flexibility and choice in how they’d like to pay and offer sellers a more streamlined way to run their businesses. 
Our advertising business remains focused on growing our Promoted Listings offerings (our first-party advertising products) while reducing non-strategic, third-party advertising. In 2021, we launched three new products: Promoted Listings Express (a cost-per-acquisition product for auction listings), Promoted Listings Advanced (a cost-per-click product) and External Promoted Listings (an off-platform advertising product). These new products complement our existing first-party advertising offering, Promoted Listings Standard (a cost-per-acquisition product for fixed-priced listings). Through our portfolio of Promoted Listings offerings, we are providing sellers with data-driven recommendations to optimize their conversion and drive velocity, while testing and building more technology features to drive growth, position eBay as the seller’s platform of choice and surface relevant inventory to buyers. 
Our Customer Offerings
We provide a number of features for our sellers and buyers that align with our approach to becoming the partner of choice for sellers and building life-long, trusted buyer relationships. These offerings are designed to build trust and confidence on our platform and drive GMV. 
To become the partner of choice for sellers, eBay continuously invests in technology to enhance the selling experience and products to grow the seller tools ecosystem. The new unified listing experience offers an intuitive and cohesive design across all platforms — desktop, mobile and app — simplifying the listing flow and enhancing seller benefits. Using computer vision technology, we launched a tool that allows sellers to scan select trading cards using eBay’s mobile apps to create a listing in less time. eBay expanded the Promoted Listings offerings to make it easier for sellers to drive velocity. We also launched personalized tools, such as coded coupons, to support a richer online seller experience. Coded coupons make it possible for sellers to personalize and distribute offers to their target customers, and 6.2 million unique buyers have made purchases using coded coupons and 69 thousand sellers have made sales with the use of coded coupons since launching in early 2021. In addition, all Seller Hub users are able to access Terapeak Product Research for free across a number of our markets — U.S., U.K., Germany, Australia, France, Italy, Spain and Canada — providing pricing insights and listing quality reports without any barriers.
In order to further strengthen our buyers’ confidence and trust in our services, we offer “eBay Money Back Guarantee,” which allows buyers to receive their money back if the item they ordered does not arrive, is faulty or damaged or does not match the listing. eBay Money Back Guarantee covers most items purchased on the eBay platform in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Australia, Canada, France, Italy and Spain through a qualifying payment method. In 2021, eBay expanded "Authenticity Guarantee," an independent authentication service, to more luxury categories and more markets. We now authenticate watches sold over $2,000 in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany; select sneakers sold over $100 in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Australia and Canada; and select handbags sold over $500 in the U.S. Additionally, to meet consumer demand for top products, we expanded our eBay Refurbished offering, a dedicated destination that brings inventory from pre-selected brands and top rated sellers with standardized condition grading.
eBay also invests in product experiences that delight our customers and enhance the buying experience for our enthusiasts. Our Collection tool allows enthusiasts to view, manage and to track the value of their trading card collection. eBay has increased the tools available for our Motors enthusiasts by expanding the My Garage feature to Canada, Italy, France and Spain and adding a motorcycle parts finder to the fitment shopping experience. In the U.S., we added our entire parts and accessories inventory to the eBay Motors app, making it easier to find the most relevant inventory.
Our Impact and Responsibility
eBay’s purpose is to empower people and create economic opportunity for all through our technology for our global community of users. Every day, people build businesses on our platforms. With a low cost of entry for sellers, we offer a highly accessible way for all types of users to interact in a global marketplace that’s inclusive and connects people of all backgrounds. Accordingly, we prioritize our corporate responsibility efforts to impact the areas of economic empowerment and sustainable commerce. Key economic programs include eBay for Charity, the eBay Foundation and our small business enablement efforts, such as our Up & Running Grants program. 
eBay for Charity empowers buyers and sellers to support charities around the world. In 2021, eBay for Charity matched donations made to Direct Relief and partnered with OXFAM, Make a Wish Foundation, Stop AAPI Hate and The Andy Warhol Foundation. In 2021, more than $145 million was raised by buyers and sellers to support charities via eBay for Charity.
The eBay Foundation helps to build economically vibrant and thriving communities. During 2021, the eBay Foundation granted over $14 million to support historically excluded entrepreneurs and our employee gift-matching program. The eBay Foundation also increased our employee gift-matching annual cap to $10,000 per employee, per year. To date, the eBay Foundation has awarded more than $76 million to more than 1,800 nonprofits. 
In 2021, eBay committed to invest $25 million in the Clear Vision Impact Fund to bolster small- and medium-sized minority-owned businesses that support historically under-served communities.
Recommerce has been an integral part of eBay’s purpose since the Company was founded in 1995. As a pioneer of the circular economy, eBay has created a space where people can buy and sell pre-owned goods. This helps preserve the world’s natural resources and reduces the Company’s carbon footprint by saving on the water and energy typically used in producing new goods and saves them from being sent to landfills. 
eBay continued its work to reach its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025 and signed its second virtual power purchase agreement in 2021. In our continued efforts to address climate change, we announced an updated carbon reduction goal that has been approved by the Science Based Target initiative: eBay commits to reduce its own (scope 1 and scope 2) emissions 90% by 2030 from a 2019 base year and to reduce value chain (scope 3) emissions from downstream transportation and distribution by 20% in the same timeframe. We will also be carbon neutral for our scope 1 and 2 emissions by the end of 2021 and each year moving forward. eBay was ranked in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Green Power Partnership National Top 100 and Top 30 Tech & Telecom for the second year. Additionally, we strive to integrate best practices in our offices and data center operations and to continually reduce our environmental footprint. This year, eBay was also recognized for its commitment to sustainability and responsible business by its inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices World and North American Indices for the third straight year. eBay also scored an A- on the CDP Climate Change questionnaire. 
Financial Information
We measure our footprint in our addressable market according to GMV. GMV consists of the total value of all paid transactions between users on our platforms during the applicable period inclusive of shipping fees and taxes. In 2021, we generated $87 billion in GMV, of which approximately 54 percent was generated outside the U.S. We believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overall volume of paid transactions that flow through our platforms in a given period.
At the end of 2021, eBay had 147 million active buyers and 17 million sellers. In 2021, we had approximately 1.5 billion live listings globally. The term “active buyer” means, as of any date, all buyer accounts that paid for a transaction on our platforms within the previous 12-month period. Buyers may register more than once and, as a result, may have more than one account. “Sellers” include consumer-to-consumer (“C2C”) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) sellers that have received payment for a transaction on our platforms within the previous 12-month period.
We generate revenue primarily from the transactions we successfully enable, including monetization of managed payments and first-party advertising and through marketing services. The majority of our revenue comes from a take rate on the GMV of transactions paid on our platforms. We define “take rate” as net transaction revenues divided by GMV.
Our platforms are designed to enable our buyers and sellers to leverage our economies of scale and capital investments, such as in sales and marketing, mobile, customer acquisition, technology innovation and customer service.
Notable Business Transactions in 2021 and 2020
We regularly review and manage our investments to ensure they support eBay’s strategic direction and complement our disciplined approach to value creation, profitability and capital allocation. eBay completed the sale of its Classifieds business to Adevinta for $2.5 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments, and 540 million Adevinta shares in the second quarter of 2021, then completed the sale of approximately 135 million shares of our Adevinta stake to Permira for approximately $2.3 billion in cash in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, we completed the sale of 80.01% of our ownership stake in eBay Korea LLC to E-mart for approximately $3.0 billion of gross cash proceeds, subject to certain adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2021.
In the first quarter of 2020, we completed the sale of StubHub to viagogo for $4.05 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments.
