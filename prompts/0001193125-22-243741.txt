Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Our Company 
 Except as otherwise indicated, the terms we, us, our, Investcorp Credit and the Company refer to Investcorp Credit Management BDC, Inc. (formerly known as CM Finance Inc through August 30, 2019) and CM Investment Partners and the Adviser refer to our investment adviser and administrator, CM Investment Partners LLC. 
 We were formed in February 2012 and commenced operations in March 2012 as CM Finance LLC, a Maryland limited liability company. Immediately prior to the pricing of our initial public offering, CM Finance LLC was merged with and into CM Finance Inc, a Maryland corporation (the Merger). On August 30, 2019, we changed our name to Investcorp Credit Management BDC, Inc. We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (BDC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), and that has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (RIC) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 We are a specialty finance company that invests primarily in the debt of U.S. middle-market companies, which we generally define as those companies that have an enterprise value, which represents the aggregate of debt value and equity value of the entity, of less than $750 million. We are externally managed by CM Investment Partners. The Adviser is led by Michael C. Mauer and Christopher E. Jansen, who together have over 40 years of experience in the leveraged debt markets. Our primary investment objective is to maximize total return to stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation by investing in debt and related equity of privately held middle-market companies. 
 We seek to invest primarily in middle-market companies that have annual revenues of at least $50 million and EBITDA of at least $15 million. We focus on companies with leading market positions, significant asset or franchise values, strong free cash flow and experienced senior management teams, with emphasis on companies with high-quality sponsors. Our investments typically range in size from $5 million to $25 million. We expect that our portfolio companies will use our capital for organic growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion, refinancings, and/or recapitalizations. We invest, and intend to continue to invest, in standalone first and second lien loans and unitranche loans, with an emphasis on floating rate debt. Unitranche loans are loans structured as first lien loans with certain characteristics of mezzanine loan risk in one security. We also selectively invest in unsecured debt, bonds and in the equity of portfolio companies through warrants and other instruments, in most cases taking such upside participation interests as part of a broader investment relationship. 
 We strive to maintain a strong focus on credit quality, investment discipline and investment selectivity. We believe that investing in the debt of private middle-market companies generally provides a more attractive relative value proposition than investing in broadly syndicated debt due to the conservative capital structures and superior default and loss characteristics typically associated with middle-market companies. We believe that, because private middle-market companies have limited access to capital providers, debt investments in these companies typically carry above-market interest rates and include more favorable protections, resulting in attractive risk-adjusted returns across credit cycles while better preserving capital. The companies in which we invest typically are highly leveraged, and, in most cases, our investments in such companies are not rated by national rating agencies. If such investments were rated, we believe that they would likely receive a rating that is often referred to as junk. 
 We previously, through CM Finance SPV Ltd. (CM SPV), our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a $102.0 million term secured financing facility (the Term Financing), due December 5, 2021 with UBS AG, London Branch (together with its affiliates UBS). The Term Financing was collateralized by a portion of the debt investments in our portfolio. On June 21, 2019, we amended the Term Financing to increase the Term 
 
1 
 
 Financing by $20.0 million from $102.0 million to $122.0 million. We subsequently repaid $20.0 million of the Term Financing on April 15, 2020. Borrowings under the Term Financing, as amended, bore interest with respect to the $102.0 million (i) at a rate per annum equal to one-month LIBOR plus 3.55% from December 5, 2019 through December 4, 2020, and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to one-month LIBOR plus 3.15% from December 5, 2020 through December 4, 2021. On November 19, 2021, the Company repaid the Term Financing in full in accordance with the terms of the Term Financing. 
 As of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, there were $0 and $102.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Term Financing, respectively. 
 On November 20, 2017, as subsequently amended, we entered into a $50 million revolving financing facility with UBS, which was subsequently amended on June 21, 2019 to reduce the size to $30.0 million and extend the maturity date (as amended, the Revolving Financing). On September 30, 2020, we amended the Revolving Financing to reduce the size of the Revolving Financing to $20.0 million and extend the maturity date to December 5, 2021. We paid a fee on any undrawn amounts of 0.75% per annum. On November 19, 2021, we satisfied all obligations under the Revolving Financing and the agreement was terminated. 
 As of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Financing. 
 On August 23, 2021, we, through Investcorp Credit Management BDC SPV, LLC (SPV LLC), our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a five-year, $115 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Capital One Revolving Financing) with Capital One, N.A. (Capital One), which is secured by collateral consisting primarily of loans in the Companys investment portfolio. The Capital One Revolving Financing, which will expire on August 22, 2026 (the Maturity Date), features a three-year reinvestment period and a two-year amortization period. 
 Borrowings under the Capital One Revolving Financing generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 2.35%. The default interest rate will be equal to the interest rate then in effect plus 2.00%. The Capital One Revolving Financing requires the payment of an upfront fee of 1.125% of the available borrowings under the Capital One Revolving Financing at the closing and requires the payment of an unused fee of (i) 0.75% annually for any undrawn amounts below 50% of the Capital One Revolving Financing, (ii) 0.50% annually for any undrawn amounts between 50% and 75% of the Capital One Revolving Financing, and (iii) 0.25% annually for any undrawn amounts above 75% of the Capital One Revolving Financing. Borrowings under the Capital One Revolving Financing are based on a borrowing base. The Capital One Revolving Financing generally requires payment of interest and fees on a quarterly basis. All outstanding principal is due on the Maturity Date. The Capital One Revolving Financing also requires mandatory prepayment of interest and principal upon certain events. 
 As of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, there were $84.0 million and $0 in borrowings outstanding under the Capital One Revolving Financing, respectively. 
 Portfolio Composition 
 As of June 30, 2022, our portfolio consisted of debt and equity investments in 35 portfolio companies with a fair value of $233.7 million. As of June 30, 2022, our portfolio at fair value consisted of 91.94% first lien investments, 0% second lien investments, and 8.06% equity, warrant or other positions. At June 30, 2022, the weighted average total yield of debt and income producing securities at amortized cost (which includes income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.09%. At June 30, 2022, our weighted average total yield on investments at amortized cost (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 9.37%. The weighted average total yield was computed using an internal rate of return calculation of our debt investments based on contractual cash flows, including interest and amortization payments, and, for floating rate investments, the spot London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate as of June 30, 2022 of all 
 
2 
 
 of our debt investments. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The weighted average total yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before payment of all of our fees and expenses, including any sales load paid in connection with an offering of our securities. There can be no assurance that the weighted average total yield will remain at its current level. 
 The industry composition of our portfolio at fair value at June 30, 2022 was as follows:

The Adviser and Administrator  CM Investment Partners LLC 
 CM Investment Partners, our external investment adviser, was formed in July 2013 and is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act). The Adviser is responsible for sourcing investment opportunities, conducting industry research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser is led by its Co-Chief Investment Officers, Michael C. Mauer and Christopher E. Jansen. Mr. Mauer also serves as the Chairman of our board of directors and our Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Jansen also serves as our President and Secretary. Mr. Mauer was formerly Global Co-Head of Leveraged Finance and Global Co-Head of Fixed Income Currency and Commodity Distribution at Citigroup Inc. and a senior member of its credit committee responsible for all underwriting and principal commitments of leveraged finance capital worldwide. Mr. Jansen was a founding Managing Partner and Senior Portfolio Manager for Stanfield Capital Partners and had a leading role in planning its strategic direction. At Stanfield, Mr. Jansen was responsible for the management of 15 different portfolios aggregating in excess of $7 billion in assets consisting of large corporate loans, middle-market loans, second lien loans, high yield bonds and structured finance securities. 
 On August 30, 2019, Investcorp Credit Management US LLC (Investcorp) acquired an approximate 76% ownership interest in the Adviser through the acquisition of the interests held by Stifel Venture Corp. (Stifel) and certain funds managed Cyrus Capital Partners, L.P. (the Cyrus Funds) and through a direct purchase of 
 
3 
 
 equity from the Adviser (the Investcorp Transaction). Investcorp is a leading global credit investment platform with assets under management of $14.7 billion as of June 30, 2022. Investcorp manages funds that invest primarily in senior secured corporate debt issued by mid and large-cap corporations in Western Europe and the United States. The Investcorp business has a strong track record of consistent performance and growth, employing approximately 39 investment professionals in London and New York. Investcorp is a subsidiary of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C. (Investcorp Holdings). Investcorp Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Investcorp, are referred to as Investcorp Group. Investcorp Group is a global provider and manager of alternative investments, offering such investments to its high-net-worth private and institutional clients on a global basis. As of June 30, 2022, Investcorp Group had $42.7 billion in total assets under management, including assets managed by third party managers and assets subject to a non-discretionary advisory mandate where Investcorp Group receives fees calculated on the basis of assets under management. Investcorp Group employs approximately 490 people across its offices in New York, London, Switzerland, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Doha, Mumbai, Beijing, and Singapore. Investcorp Group has been engaged in the investment management and related services business since 1982, and brings enhanced capabilities to the Adviser. 
 The Advisers investment team, led by Messrs. Mauer and Jansen, is supported by three additional investment professionals, who, together with Messrs. Mauer and Jansen, we refer to as the Investment Team. The members of the Investment Team have over 100 combined years of structuring customized debt solutions for middle-market companies, which we believe will enable us to generate favorable returns across credit cycles with an emphasis on preserving capital. Messrs. Mauer and Jansen have developed an investment process for reviewing lending opportunities, structuring transactions and monitoring investments throughout multiple credit cycles. The members of the Investment Team have extensive networks for sourcing investment opportunities through direct corporate relationships and relationships with private equity firms, investment banks, restructuring advisors, law firms, boutique advisory firms and distressed/specialty lenders. The members of the Investment Team also have extensive experience across various industries, including aviation, cable, defense, healthcare, media, mining, oil and gas, power, retail, telecommunications, trucking and asset-backed special situations. As a result, we believe we will be able to achieve appropriate risk-adjusted returns by investing in companies that have restructured but do not have sufficient track records to receive traditional lending terms from a commercial bank or the broadly syndicated leveraged finance market. We believe the members of the Investment Team share a common investment philosophy built on a framework of rigorous business assessment, extensive due diligence and disciplined risk valuation methodology. 
 Every initial investment by us requires the approval by a majority of the Advisers investment committee (the Investment Committee) and such majority must include both Messrs. Mauer and Jansen. Every follow-on investment decision in an existing portfolio company and every investment disposition require approval by a majority of the Investment Committee. The Investment Committee currently consists of Messrs. Mauer and Jansen, the Co-Chief Investment Officers of the Adviser, and Andrew Muns, a Managing Director of the Adviser. In addition, Jeremy Ghose, the Managing Director and Head of Investcorp, has a non-voting observer role on the Investment Committee. 
 In connection with the Investcorp Transaction, on June 26, 2019, our board of directors, including all of the directors who are not interested persons of the Company, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (each, an Independent Director), unanimously approved a new investment advisory agreement (the Advisory Agreement) and recommended that the Advisory Agreement be submitted to our stockholders for approval, which our stockholders approved at the Special Meeting of Stockholders held on August 28, 2019. At the closing of the Investcorp Transaction on August 30, 2019, we entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Adviser, pursuant to which we pay the Adviser a management fee equal to 1.75% of our gross assets, payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. In addition, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, we pay the Adviser an incentive fee equal to 20.0% of pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to an annualized hurdle rate of 8.0% with a catch up fee for returns between the 8.0% hurdle and 10.0%, as well as 20.0% of net capital gains. 
 At the closing of the Investcorp Transaction on August 30, 2019, we entered into a new administration agreement with the Adviser (the Administration Agreement). Under the Administration Agreement, the 
 
4 
 
 Adviser provides us with our chief financial officer, accounting and back-office professionals, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services. The terms of the Administration Agreement, including the reimbursement of expenses by the Company to the Adviser, are identical to those contained in the Companys prior administration agreement with the Adviser (the Prior Administration Agreement). 
 In connection with the Investcorp Transaction, on June 26, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive stock purchase and transaction agreement with Investcorp BDC Holdings Limited (Investcorp BDC), an affiliate of Investcorp (the Stock Purchase Agreement). Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Investcorp BDC was required by August 30, 2021 to purchase (i) 680,985 newly issued shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at the most recently determined net asset value per share of the Companys common stock at the time of such purchase, as adjusted as necessary to comply with Section 23 of the 1940 Act, and (ii) 680,985 shares of the Companys common stock in open-market or secondary transactions. Investcorp BDC has completed all required purchases under the Stock Purchase Agreement. 
 Market Opportunity 
 We believe that the current investment environment presents a compelling case for investing in secured debt (including standalone first and second lien loans and unitranche loans) and unsecured debt (including mezzanine/structured equity) of middle-market companies. The following factors represent the key drivers of our focus on this attractive market segment: 

 | Reduced Availability of Capital for Middle-Market Companies. We believe there are fewer providers of financing and less capital available for middle-market companies compared to prior to the economic downturn that began in mid-2007. We believe that, as a result of that downturn:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | many financing providers have chosen to focus on large, liquid corporate loans and syndicated capital markets transactions rather than lending to middle-market businesses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | regulatory changes have caused many commercial and investment banks, in recent years, to de-emphasize their service and product offerings to middle-market companies in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | hedge funds and collateralized loan obligation managers are less likely to pursue investment opportunities in our target market as a result of reduced availability of funding for new investments; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | consolidation of regional banks into money center banks has reduced their focus on middle-market lending.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result, we believe that less competition facilitates higher quality deal flow and allows for greater selectivity throughout the investment process. 
 

 | Robust Demand for Debt Capital. According to Pitchbook, a market research firm, private equity firms had approximately $749 billion of uncalled capital as of June 30, 2022. They have expanded their focus to include middle-market opportunities due to the lack of opportunities in large capital buyout transactions. We expect the large amount of uninvested capital and the expanded focus on middle-market opportunities to drive buyout activity over the next several years, which should, in turn, continue to create lending opportunities for us.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Attractive Deal Pricing and Structures. We believe that, in general, middle-market debt investments are priced more attractively to lenders than larger, more liquid, public debt financings, due to the more limited universe of lenders as well as the highly negotiated nature of these financings. Middle-market transactions tend to offer stronger covenant packages, higher interest rates, lower leverage levels and better call protection compared to larger financings. In addition, middle-market loans typically offer other investor protections such as default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5 
 

information rights for lenders. Further, we believe that in the current environment, as the economy reopens following the economic shutdown resulting from the COVID-19 national health emergency, lenders with available capital may be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities as the economy reopens and may be able to achieve improved economic spreads and documentation terms.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Specialized Lending Requirements. We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the Investment Teams experience, lending to private U.S. middle-market companies is generally more labor-intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies. Lending to smaller capitalization companies requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender. As a result, middle-market companies historically have been served by a limited segment of the lending community.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that the Advisers disciplined approach to origination, portfolio construction and risk management should allow us to achieve favorable risk-adjusted returns while preserving our capital. We believe that the following competitive strengths provide positive returns for our investors: 

 | Experienced Team with Substantial Resources. The Adviser and its Investment Team is led by Messrs. Mauer and Jansen, each with over 40 years of experience investing in, providing corporate finance services to, restructuring and consulting with middle-market companies. Messrs. Mauer and Jansen are supported by three additional investment professionals, who collectively with Messrs. Mauer and Jansen, have over 100 combined years of structuring strategic capital for business expansion, refinancings, capital restructuring, post-reorganization financing and servicing the general corporate needs of middle-market companies. The Adviser also benefits from its alignment with Investcorp, its parent company, which is the leading global credit investment platform with assets under management of $14.7 billion as of June 30, 2022. We believe that the Investment Team and its substantial resources, including through its relationship with Investcorp, provide a significant advantage and contribute to the strength of our business and enhance the quantity and quality of investment opportunities available to us.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Capitalize on the Investment Teams Extensive Relationships with Middle-Market Companies, Private Equity Sponsors and Intermediaries. The members of the Investment Team have extensive networks for sourcing investment opportunities through corporate relationships and relationships with private equity firms, investment banks, restructuring advisors, law firms, boutique advisory firms and distressed/specialty lenders. We believe that the strength of these relationships in conjunction with the Investment Teams ability to structure financing solutions for companies that incorporate credit protections at attractive returns for us provide us with a competitive advantage in identifying investment opportunities in our target market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Disciplined Underwriting Policies and Rigorous Portfolio Management. Messrs. Mauer and Jansen have an established credit analysis and investment process to analyze investment opportunities thoroughly. This process, followed by the Investment Team, includes structuring loans with appropriate covenants and pricing loans based on our knowledge of the middle-market and our rigorous underwriting standards. We focus on capital preservation by extending loans to portfolio companies with assets that we believe will retain sufficient value to repay us even in depressed markets or under liquidation scenarios. Each investment is analyzed from its initial stages by either Mr. Mauer or Mr. Jansen, as the Advisers Co-Chief Investment Officers, and an additional investment professional of the Investment Team. The Investment Committee consists of Messrs. Mauer, Jansen and Muns, with Mr. Ghose as a non-voting observer. Every initial investment requires approval by a majority of the Investment Committee and such majority must include both Messrs. Mauer and Jansen. Every follow-on investment decision in an existing portfolio company and every investment disposition require approval by at least a majority of the Investment Committee. Under the supervision of Messrs. Mauer and Jansen, the
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
6 
 

Investment Teams investment professionals also monitor the portfolio for developments, perform credit updates on each investment, review financial performance on at least a quarterly basis, and have regular discussions with the management of portfolio companies. We believe the Advisers investment and monitoring process and the depth and experience of the Investment Team gives us a competitive advantage in identifying investments and evaluating risks and opportunities throughout the life cycle of an investment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Ability to Structure Investments Creatively. Our Investment Team has the expertise and ability to structure investments across all levels of a companys capital structure. These individuals have extensive experience in cash flow, asset-based lending, workout situations and investing in distressed debt, which should enable us to take advantage of attractive investments in recently restructured companies. Furthermore, we believe we are in a better position to leverage the existing knowledge and relationships that the Investment Team has developed to lead investments that meet our investment criteria. We believe that current market conditions allow us to structure attractively priced debt investments and may allow us to incorporate other return-enhancing mechanisms such as commitment fees, original issue discounts (OID), early redemption premiums, payment-in-kind (PIK) interest and certain forms of equity securities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investment Strategy 
 We invest in standalone first and second lien loans and unitranche loans, and selectively in unsecured debt, bonds and in the equity of portfolio companies through warrants and other instruments, in most cases taking advantage of a potential benefit from an increase in the value of such portfolio company as part of an overall relationship. We seek to invest primarily in middle-market companies that have annual revenues of at least $50 million and EBITDA of at least $15 million. Our investments typically range in size from $5 million to $25 million. We may invest in smaller or larger companies if there is an attractive opportunity, especially when there are dislocations in the capital markets, including the high yield and large syndicated loan markets. During such dislocations, we expect to see more deep value investment opportunities offering prospective returns that are disproportionate to the associated risk profile. We focus on companies with leading market positions, significant asset or franchise values, strong free cash flow and experienced senior management teams, with an emphasis on companies with high-quality sponsors. 
 Our primary investment objective is to maximize current income and capital appreciation by investing directly in privately held middle-market companies. The Adviser pursues investments for us with favorable risk-adjusted returns, including debt investments that offer cash origination fees and lower leverage levels. The Adviser seeks to structure our debt investments with strong protections, including default penalties, information rights, and affirmative and negative financial covenants, such as lien protection and restrictions concerning change of control. We believe these protections, coupled with the other features of our investments, allow us to reduce our risk of capital loss and achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, although there can be no assurance that we are always able to structure our investments to minimize risk of loss and achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Investment Criteria 
 The Investment Team uses the following investment criteria and guidelines to evaluate prospective portfolio companies. However, not all of these criteria and guidelines are used or met in connection with each of our investments. 

 | Established companies with a history of positive operating cash flow. We seek to invest in established companies with sound historical financial performance. The Adviser typically focuses on companies with a history of profitability on an operating cash flow basis. We do not intend to invest in start-up companies or companies with speculative business plans.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Defensible and sustainable business. We seek to invest in companies with proven products and/or services that provide a competitive advantage versus its competitors or new entrants. The Adviser places
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 
 

an emphasis on the strength of historical operations and profitability and the generation of free cash flow to reinvest in the business or to utilize for debt service. The Adviser also focuses on the relative strength of the valuation and liquidity of collateral used to provide security for our investments, when applicable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Seasoned management team with meaningful equity ownership. The Adviser generally requires that our portfolio companies have a seasoned management team, with strong corporate governance. The Adviser also seeks to invest in companies with management teams that have meaningful equity ownership. The Adviser believes that companies that have proper incentives in place, including having significant equity interests, motivate management teams to enhance enterprise value, which will act in accordance with our interests.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Significant Invested Capital. The Adviser seeks investments in portfolio companies where it believes that the aggregate enterprise value significantly exceeds aggregate indebtedness, after consideration of our investment. The Adviser believes that the existence of significant underlying equity value (i.e., the amount by which the aggregate enterprise value exceeds the aggregate indebtedness) provides important support to our debt investments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Investment Partnerships. We seek to invest where private equity sponsors have demonstrated capabilities in building enterprise value. In addition, we seek to partner with specialty lenders and other financial institutions. The Adviser believes that private equity sponsors and specialty lenders can serve as committed partners and advisors that will actively work with the Adviser, the company and its management team to meet company goals and create value.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Ability to exert meaningful influence. We target investment opportunities in which we will be a significant investor in the tranche and in which we can add value through active participation in the direction of the company, sometimes through advisory positions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Exit strategy. We generally seek to invest in companies that the Adviser believes possess attributes that will provide us with the ability to exit our investments. We typically expect to exit our investments through one of three scenarios: (i) the sale of the company resulting in repayment of all outstanding debt, (ii) the recapitalization of the company through which our loan is replaced with debt or equity from a third party or parties or (iii) the repayment of the initial or remaining principal amount of our loan then outstanding at maturity. In some investments, there may be scheduled amortization of some portion of our loan, which would result in a partial exit of our investment prior to the maturity of the loan.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deal Origination 
 The Advisers deal-originating efforts are focused on its direct corporate relationships and relationships with private equity firms, investment banks, restructuring advisers, law firms, and boutique advisory firms and distressed/specialty lenders. The Advisers investment team continues to enhance and expand these relationships. 
 The origination process is designed to thoroughly evaluate potential financings and to identify the most attractive of these opportunities on the basis of risk-adjusted returns. Each investment is analyzed from its initial stages through our investment by one of the Co-Chief Investment Officers of the Adviser and an additional investment professional. If an opportunity fits our criteria for investment and merits further review and consideration, the investment is presented to the Investment Committee. This first stage of analysis involves a preliminary, but detailed, description of the potential financing. An investment summary is then generated after preliminary due diligence. The opportunity may be discussed several times by members of the Investment Team. Prior to funding, every initial investment requires the approval of a majority of the Investment Committee and such majority must include both Messrs. Mauer and Jansen. Follow-on investment decisions in existing portfolio companies and investment dispositions require the approval of a majority of the Investment Committee. 
 If the Adviser decides to pursue an opportunity, a preliminary term sheet will be produced for the target portfolio company. This term sheet serves as a basis for the discussion and negotiation of the critical terms of the proposed financing. At this stage, the Adviser begins its formal underwriting and investment approval process as 
 
8 
 
 described below. After the negotiation of a transaction, the financing is presented to the Investment Committee of the Adviser for approval. Upon approval of a financing transaction, the parties will prepare the relevant loan documentation. An investment is funded only after all due diligence is satisfactorily completed and all closing conditions have been satisfied. The investments in our portfolio are monitored by a member of the Investment Committee aided by the investment professionals of the Investment Team, who also perform credit updates on each investment quarterly. 
 Underwriting 
 Underwriting process and investment approval 
 The Adviser makes investment decisions only after considering a number of factors regarding the potential investment including, but not limited to: 
 

 | historical and projected financial performance;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | company and industry specific characteristics, such as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | composition and experience of the management team; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | track record of the private equity sponsor leading the transaction, if applicable.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This methodology is employed to screen a high volume of potential investment opportunities on a consistent basis. 
 If an investment is deemed appropriate to pursue, a more detailed and rigorous evaluation is made after considering relevant investment parameters. The following outlines the general parameters and areas of evaluation and due diligence for investment decisions, although not all are necessarily considered or given equal weighting in the evaluation process. 
 Business model and financial assessment 
 The Adviser undertakes a review and analysis of the financial and strategic plans for the potential investment. There is significant evaluation of and reliance upon the due diligence performed by the private equity sponsor, if applicable, and third-party experts, including accountants and consultants. Areas of evaluation include: 
 

 | historical and projected financial performance;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | quality of earnings, including source and predictability of cash flows;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | customer and vendor interviews and assessments;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | potential exit scenarios, including probability of a liquidity event;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | internal controls and accounting systems; and
--+----------------------------------------------


 | assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
--+------------------------------------------------

 Industry dynamics 
 The Adviser evaluates the portfolio companys industry, and may, if considered appropriate, consult or retain industry experts. The following factors are among those the Adviser analyzes: 
 

 | sensitivity to economic cycles;
--+--------------------------------


 | competitive environment, including number of competitors, threat of new entrants or substitutes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fragmentation and relative market share of industry leaders;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | growth potential; and
--+----------------------

 
9 
 

 | regulatory and legal environment.
--+----------------------------------

 Management assessment 
 The Adviser makes an in-depth assessment of the management team, including evaluation along several key metrics: 
 

 | background checks;
--+-------------------


 | the number of years in their current positions;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | track record;
--+--------------


 | industry experience;
--+---------------------


 | management incentive, including the level of direct investment in the enterprise; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | completeness of the management team (positions that need to be filled or added).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sponsor assessment 
 Among critical due diligence investigations is the evaluation of a private equity sponsor or specialty lender that has, or is also making, an investment in the portfolio company. A private equity sponsor is typically a controlling stockholder upon completion of an investment and as such is considered critical to the success of the investment. In addition, a management team with meaningful equity ownership can serve as a committed partner to us and any private equity sponsor or specialty lender. The Adviser evaluates a private equity sponsor or specialty lender along several key criteria, including: 
 

 | investment track record;
--+-------------------------


 | industry experience.
--+---------------------


 | capacity and willingness to provide additional financial support to the company through additional capital contributions, if necessary; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | reference checks.
--+------------------

Investments 
 The following describes the types of loans we generally make: 
 Standalone first lien loans. Standalone first lien loans are loans that are typically senior on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuers capital structure and have the benefit of a security interest on the assets of the portfolio company. Standalone first lien loans may provide for moderate loan amortization in the early years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. 
 Standalone second lien loans. Standalone second lien loans are loans that are typically senior on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuers capital structure and have the benefit of a security interest over the assets of the borrower, although ranking junior to first lien loans. Standalone second lien loans may provide for moderate loan amortization in the early years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. Standalone second lien loans can incur greater frictional costs (e.g., increased professional costs relating to resolving conflicts among the lenders) in the event of a workout and, partly because of this possible impact on recovery rates, we expect to demand a significantly higher risk premium in the form of higher spreads, call protection and/or warrants for extending standalone second lien loans, compared to first lien loans of similar credit quality. 
 Unitranche loans. Unitranche loans are loans structured as first lien loans with certain characteristics of mezzanine loan risk in one security. Unitranche loans typically provide for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the loan with the majority of the principal repayment deferred until loan maturity. Unitranche 
 
10 
 
 loans usually provide us with greater control over a portfolio companys capital structure, as they provide a one-stop financing solution and limit frictional costs (e.g., negotiations with, and concessions to, other lien holders) in the event of a workout process. Consistent with our focus on capital preservation, unitranche loans typically have less volatile returns than standalone second lien or mezzanine loans. 
 Mezzanine loans/structured equity. Mezzanine loans are subordinated to senior secured loans on a payment basis, are typically unsecured and rank pari passu with other unsecured creditors of the issuer. As with standalone second lien loans, we expect to demand a significantly higher risk premium in the form of higher spreads, call protection and/or warrants for mezzanine loans, given the lower recovery rates for such securities due in part to the greater frictional costs (e.g., increased professional costs relating to resolving conflicts among the lenders) in a protracted workout. We may take mezzanine type risk in the form of structured equity investments. In cases where portfolio companies may be constrained in their ability to raise additional capital in the form of debt, we may have the opportunity to structure preferred equity or other equity-like instruments. These equity instruments typically have redemption rights and will either be convertible into common equity at our option or will have detachable warrants compensating us for the additional risk inherent in such investments. In most cases, these equity instruments will have debt-like characteristics, which provide more downside protection than a typical equity instrument. 
 Equity components. In connection with some of our debt investments, we will also invest in preferred or common stock or receive nominally priced warrants or options to buy an equity interest in the portfolio company. As a result, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. The Adviser may structure such equity investments and warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a put, or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and piggyback registration rights. 
 Portfolio Management Strategy 
 The investments in our portfolio are monitored by a member of the Investment Committee aided by the investment professionals of the Investment Team, who also perform credit updates on each investment quarterly. 
Risk Ratings 
 In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, we use the Advisers investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. This investment rating system uses a five-level numeric rating scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 

Investment Rating 1 | Investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. 
Investment Rating 2 | Investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans are initially rated 2. 
Investment Rating 3 | Investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with their financial covenants. 
Investment Rating 4 | Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in workout. Investments with a rating of 4 are those for which some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected.

 
11 
 

Investment Rating 5 | Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in workout. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected.

 If the Adviser determines that an investment is underperforming, or circumstances suggest that the risk associated with a particular investment has significantly increased, the Adviser will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the Investment Committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. While the investment rating system identifies the relative risk for each investment, the rating alone does not dictate the scope and/or frequency of any monitoring that will be performed. The frequency of the Advisers monitoring of an investment is determined by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the trends in the financial performance of the portfolio company, the investment structure and the type of collateral securing the investment. 
 The following table shows the investment rankings of the debt investments in our portfolio:

Determination of Net Asset Value and Portfolio Valuation Process 
 The net asset value per share of our outstanding shares of common stock is determined quarterly by dividing total assets minus liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding. 
 In calculating the value of our total assets, investment transactions will be recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses will be computed using the specific identification method. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market price is not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors based on the input of our management and audit committee. In addition, our board of directors retains one or more independent valuation firms to review each quarter, the valuation of each portfolio investment for which a market quotation is not available. We also have adopted Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. This accounting statement requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is assumed to be sold in the principal market to market participants, or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, the market in which we can exit portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level activity is considered our principal market. 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations unless the quotations are deemed not to represent fair value. We generally obtain market quotations from recognized exchanges, market quotation systems, independent pricing services or one or more broker dealers or market makers. 
 Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board 
 
12 
 
 of directors. Because a readily available market value for many of the investments in our portfolio is often not available, we value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors using a consistently applied valuation process in accordance with a documented valuation policy that has been reviewed and approved by our board of directors. Due to the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events may have differing impacts on the market quotations used to value some of our investments than on the fair values of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available. Market quotations may also be deemed not to represent fair value in certain circumstances where we believe that facts and circumstances applicable to an issuer, a seller or purchaser, or the market for a particular security causes current market quotations not to reflect the fair value of the security. Examples of these events could include cases where a security trades infrequently, causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, where there is a forced sale by a distressed seller, where market quotations vary substantially among market makers, or where there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid ask spread. 
 Those investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments include, as relevant and among other factors: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio companys ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, merger and acquisition comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 

 | our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed by the investment team of the Adviser;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | on a periodic basis, at least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment is reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the valuation committee of our board of directors then reviews these preliminary valuations and makes a recommendation to our board of directors regarding the fair value of each investment; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the board of directors then discusses these preliminary valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of the Adviser, the independent valuation firm and the valuation committee.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act was adopted by the SEC in December 2020 and establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. Our board of directors has adopted valuation policies and procedures that are intended to comply with Rule 2a-5.

13 
 
Realization of Investments 
 The potential exit scenarios of a portfolio company will play an important role in evaluating investment decisions. The Adviser will formulate specific exit strategies at the time of each investment. Our debt orientation will provide for increased potential exit opportunities, including the sale of investments in the private markets, the refinancing of investments held, often due to maturity or recapitalizations, and other liquidity events including the sale or merger of the portfolio company. Since we seek to maintain a debt orientation in our investments, we generally expect to receive interest income over the course of the investment period, receiving a significant return on invested capital well in advance of final exit. 
Derivatives 
 We may utilize hedging techniques such as interest rate swaps to mitigate potential interest rate risk on our indebtedness. Such interest rate swaps would principally be used to protect us against higher costs on our indebtedness resulting from increases in both short-term and long-term interest rates. We also may use various hedging and other risk management strategies to seek to manage various risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Such hedging strategies would be utilized to seek to protect the value of our portfolio investments, for example, against possible adverse changes in the market value of securities held in our portfolio. 
Managerial Assistance 
 As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. The Adviser will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We may receive fees for these services and will reimburse the Adviser for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review by our board of directors, including our Independent Directors. 
Competition 
 Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC. 
 We use the expertise of the investment professionals of the Adviser to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we believe the relationships of these investment professionals will enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. 
 Staffing 
 We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by the Adviser. We have a Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer. To the extent necessary, our board of directors may hire additional personnel in the future. Our officers are all 
 
14 
 
 employees of the Adviser and our allocable portion of the cost of Rocco DelGuercio, as our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer, and his staff, is paid by us pursuant to the Administration Agreement with the Adviser. 
 At the closing of the Investcorp Transaction on August 30, 2019, the Adviser entered into a services agreement with Investcorp International Inc. (Investcorp International), an affiliate of Investcorp (the Investcorp Services Agreement), through which the Adviser can utilize the expertise of Investcorps accounting and back-office professionals on an as-needed basis upon the request of the Adviser. 
 Management Agreements 
 Advisory Agreement 
 The Advisory Agreement went into effect on August 30, 2019 (the Commencement Date). 
 Management Services 
 Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act, the Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser: 
 

 | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | executes, closes, services and monitors the investments we make;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | determines the securities and other assets that we will purchase, retain or sell;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Advisers services under the Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it may furnish similar services to other entities. 
 Management Fee 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components  a base management fee (the Base Management Fee) and an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee). The cost of both the Base Management Fee and the Incentive Fee will ultimately be borne by our stockholders. 
Base Management Fee 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, the Base Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage and excluding cash and cash equivalents (such amount, Gross Assets). 
 The Base Management Fee is calculated based on the average value of our Gross Assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The Base Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears and the Base Management Fees for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately pro-rated.

15 
 
Incentive Fee 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, the Incentive Fee, which provides the Adviser with a share of the income that it generates for the Company, has two components, ordinary income (the Income-Based Fee) and capital gains (the Capital Gains Fee). Incentive Fees are calculated as described below and payable quarterly in arrears (or, upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date). 
 Income-Based Fee 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, the Income-Based Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below) for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, subject to a total return requirement (the Total Return Requirement) and deferral of non-cash amounts, and is 20.0% of the amount, if any, by which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets attributable to its common stock, for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, exceeds a 2.0% (which is 8.0% annualized) hurdle rate and a catch-up provision measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, in any fiscal quarter, the Adviser receives no Incentive Fee until our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income equals the hurdle rate of 2.0%, but then receives, as a catch-up, 100% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5% (which is 10.0% annualized). The effect of the catch-up provision is that, subject to the Total Return Requirement and deferral provisions discussed below, if Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter, the Adviser receives 20.0% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial assistance and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the fiscal quarter, minus the Companys operating expenses for the quarter (including the Base Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and any distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the Incentive Fee, it is possible that we may pay an Incentive Fee in a quarter where we incur a loss, subject to the Total Return Requirement and deferral of non-cash amounts. For example, if we receive Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, we would pay the applicable Incentive Fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the Incentive Fee is also included in the amount of its gross assets used to calculate the 1.75% Base Management Fee. These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, the Income-Based Fee is subject to the Total Return Requirement. No Income-Based Fee is payable under the Advisory Agreement except to the extent 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the fiscal quarter for which fees are being calculated and the Lookback Period exceeds the cumulative Incentive Fees accrued and/or paid for the Lookback Period. For the foregoing purpose, the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations is the amount, if positive, of the sum of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of the Company for the then current fiscal quarter and the Lookback Period. The Lookback Period means (1) through June 30, 2022, the period that on the last day of the fiscal quarter in which the Commencement Date occurs and ends on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the fiscal quarter for which the Income-Based Fee is being calculated, and (2) after June 30, 2022, the eleven fiscal quarters immediately preceding the fiscal quarter for which the Income-Based Fee is being calculated. 
 
16 
 
In addition, under the Advisory Agreement, the portion of such Incentive Fee that is attributable to deferred interest (such as PIK interest or OID) will be paid to the Adviser only if and to the extent we actually receive such interest in cash, and any accrual thereof will be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write-off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual. Any reversal of such accounts would reduce net income for the quarter by the net amount of the reversal (after taking into account the reversal of Incentive Fees payable) and would result in a reduction and possible elimination of the Incentive Fees for such quarter. Notwithstanding any such Incentive Fee reduction or elimination, there is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter, and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle, and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. 
 The following is a graphic representation of the calculation of the Income-Based Fee: 
 Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income 
 Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 
 


Percentage of Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 Allocated to Income-Based Fee 
 Capital Gains Fee 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, the Capital Gains Fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, and will equal to 20.0% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from the Commencement Date through the end of each fiscal year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fees. If such amount is negative, then no Capital Gains Fee will be payable for such year. Additionally, if the Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a fiscal year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a fiscal year end for purposes of calculating and paying the Capital Gains Fee. 
 Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, was calculate the Capital Gains Fee as if we had realized all assets at their fair values as of the reporting date. Accordingly, we accrue a provisional Capital Gains Fee taking into account any unrealized gains or losses. As the provisional Capital Gains Fee is subject to the performance of investments until there is a realization event, the amount of the provisional Capital Gains Fee accrued at a reporting date may vary from the Capital Gains Fee that is ultimately realized and the differences could be material. 
 Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation 
 Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee before Total Return Requirement Calculation: 
 Alternative 1 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25% 
 
17 
 
Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0% 
 Management fee(2) = 0.4375% 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.2% 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 (investment income  (management fee + other expenses) = 0.6125% 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no income-related incentive fee. 
 Alternative 2 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.9% 
 Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0% 
 Management fee(2) = 0.4375% 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.2% 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 (investment income  (management fee + other expenses) = 2.2625% 
 Incentive fee = 100% × Pre-incentive fee net investment income (subject to catch-up)(4)
= 100% × (2.2625%  2.0%) 
 = 0.2625% 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the catch-up provision; therefore, the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.2625%. 
 Alternative 3 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5% 
 Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0% 
 Management fee(2) = 0.4375% 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.2% 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 (investment income  (management fee + other expenses) = 2.8625% 
 
 
Incentive fee = | 100% × Pre-incentive fee net investment income (subject to catch-up)(4) 
Incentive fee = | 100% × catch-up + (20.0% × (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income  2.5%))
Catch-up = 2.5%  2.0% 
= 0.5% 
Incentive fee = | (100% × 0.5%) + (20.0% × (2.8625%  2.5%)) 
= 0.5% + (20.0% × 0.3625%)
= 0.5% + 0.725% 
= 0.5725% 

 Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, and fully satisfies the catch-up provision; therefore, the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.5725%.

(3) | Excludes organizational and offering expenses.
----+-----------------------------------------------


(4) | The catch-up provision is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 20.0% on all pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2: Income Portion of Incentive Fee with Total Return Requirement Calculation: 
 Alternative 1: 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5% 
 Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0% 
 Management fee(2) = 0.4375% 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.2% 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 (investment income  (management fee + other expenses) = 2.8625% 
 Cumulative incentive compensation accrued and/or paid for preceding 11 calendar quarters = $9,000,000 20.0% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over current and preceding 11 calendar quarters = $8,000,000 
 Although our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 2.0% (as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above), no incentive fee is payable because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters did not exceed the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the preceding 11 calendar quarters. 
 Alternative 2: 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5% 
 Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0% 
 Management fee(2) = 0.4375% 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.2% 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 (investment income  (management fee + other expenses) = 2.8625% 
 Cumulative incentive compensation accrued and/or paid for preceding 11 calendar quarters = $9,000,000 20.0% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over current and preceding 11 calendar quarters = $10,000,000 
 Because our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 2.0% and because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the preceding 11 calendar quarters, an incentive fee would be payable, as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above.

Example 3: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee(*): 
 
19 
 
Alternative 1: 
 Assumptions 
 

Year 1: | $2.0 million investment made in Company A (Investment A), and $3.0 million investment made in Company B (Investment B)
Year 2: | Investment A sold for $5.0 million and fair market value (FMV) of Investment B determined to be $3.5 million 
Year 3: | FMV of Investment B determined to be $2.0 million 
Year 4: | Investment B sold for $3.25 million 

 The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: 
 

Year 1: | None 
Year 2: | Capital gains incentive fee of $0.6 million  ($3.0 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20.0%) 
Year 3: | None  $0.4 million (20.0% multiplied by ($3.0 million cumulative capital gains less $1.0 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $0.6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2)
Year 4: | Capital gains incentive fee of $50,000  $0.65 million ($3.25 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $0.6 million (capital gains incentive fee taken in Year 2) 

Alternative 2 
 Assumptions 
 

Year 1: | $2.0 million investment made in Company A (Investment A), $5.25 million investment made in Company B (Investment B) and $4.5 million investment made in Company C (Investment C)
Year 2: | Investment A sold for $4.5 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $4.75 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $4.5 million 
Year 3: | FMV of Investment B determined to be $5.0 million and Investment C sold for $5.5 million 
Year 4: | FMV of Investment B determined to be $6.0 million 
Year 5: | Investment B sold for $4.0 million 

 The capital gains incentive fee, if any, would be: 
 

Year 1: | None 
Year 2: | Capital gains incentive fee of $0.4 million  20.0% multiplied by $2.0 million ($2.5 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $0.5 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B) 
Year 3: | $0.25 million capital gains incentive fee(1)  $0.65 million (20.0% multiplied by $3.25 million ($3.5 million cumulative realized capital gains less $0.25 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $0.4 million capital gains incentive fee received in Year 2
Year 4: | $0.05 million capital gains incentive fee  $0.7 million ($3.50 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20.0%) less $0.65 million cumulative capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3 
Year 5: | None  $0.45 million (20.0% multiplied by $2.25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $3.5 million less realized capital losses of $1.25 million)) less $0.7 million cumulative capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4(2)

* | The hypothetical amounts of returns shown are based on a percentage of our total net assets and assume no leverage. There is no guarantee that positive returns will be realized and actual returns may vary from those shown in this example.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(1) | As illustrated in Year 3 of Alternative 1 above, if a portfolio company were to be wound up on a date other than its fiscal year end of any year, it may have paid aggregate capital gains incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if such portfolio company had been wound up on its fiscal year end of such year.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | As noted above, it is possible that the cumulative aggregate capital gains fee received by the Adviser ($0.70 million) is effectively greater than $0.45 million (20% of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less net realized capital losses or net unrealized depreciation ($2.25 million)).
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Payment of Our Expenses 
 The Base Management Fee and Incentive Fee compensation provided for in the Advisory Agreement remunerates the Adviser for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments.

Duration and Termination 
 Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Advisory Agreement will be in effect for an initial two-year term and will continue in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by our board of directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Companys outstanding voting securities and a majority of the Independent Directors. 
 The Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty by delivering notice of termination upon not less than 60 days written notice to the other party and will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities may also terminate the Advisory Agreement without penalty upon 60 days written notice. 
 Indemnification 
 The Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations under the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of the Advisers services under the Advisory Agreement or otherwise as the Adviser. 
Board Approval of the Advisory Agreement 
 On August 25, 2022, our board of directors, including all of the Independent Directors, held a meeting to consider and approve the continuation of the Advisory Agreement. In its consideration of the Advisory Agreement, our board of directors took into consideration (1) the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to the Company by the Adviser; (2) comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives; (3) the Companys operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives; (4) the expected profitability of the Adviser; (5) information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Advisory Agreement; (6) the organizational capability and financial condition of the Adviser and its affiliates; and (7) other factors our board of directors deemed to be relevant. In its deliberations, our board of directors did not identify any single piece of information discussed below that was all-important, controlling or determinative of its decision. 
 Based on the information reviewed and the discussion thereof, our board of directors, including all of the Independent Directors, determined that the investment advisory fee rates are reasonable in relation to the services provided and approved the continuation of the Advisory Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders. In voting to approve the Advisory Agreement, our board of directors, including all of the Independent Directors, made the following conclusions: 
 

 | Nature, Extent and Quality of Services. In considering the nature, extent and quality of the services to be provided by the Adviser, our board of directors discussed the experience of current key personnel of the Adviser and considered its experience with the Adviser providing investment management services to the Company. Our board of directors also considered the investment selection process employed by the Adviser, including the flow of transaction opportunities resulting from the Investment Teams significant experience in structuring strategic capital for business expansion, refinancings, capital restructuring, post-reorganization financing and servicing the general corporate needs of middle-market companies; the employment of the Advisers investment philosophy, diligence procedures, credit
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
22 
 

recommendation process, investment structuring, and ongoing relationships with and monitoring of portfolio companies, in light of the investment objective of the Company. Our board of directors also considered the Advisers personnel and their prior experience in connection with the types of investments made by us, including such personnels corporate relationships and relationships with private equity firms, investment banks, restructuring advisors, law firms, boutique advisory firms and distressed/specialty lenders. In addition, our board of directors considered the other terms and conditions of the Advisory Agreement. Our board of directors determined that the substantive terms of the Advisory Agreement (other than the fees payable thereunder, which our board of directors reviewed separately), including the services to be provided, are similar to those of comparable BDCs described in the available market data and in the best interests of our stockholders. Based on the factors above, as well as those discussed below, our board of directors concluded that it was satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of the services to be provided to the Company by the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Comparison to Other Business Development Companies. Our board of directors reviewed a detailed comparison of performance metrics of the Company and a sample of peer BDCs. In considering the appropriate performance metrics by which to benchmark the Companys performance against its peers, our board of directors focused on certain factors that it believes are significant drivers of stockholder value. Our board of directors considered the comparison of performance metrics as it relates to the management and incentive fees to be paid to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement, in comparison to the fees paid to other externally managed BDCs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our board of directors noted that the exclusion of cash and cash equivalents from the Base Management Fee calculation makes it more beneficial to stockholders than certain other fee structures in the peer group. Our board of directors also noted the stockholder-friendly three-year Total Return Requirement, which would result in the net investment income amount utilized for the income-based Incentive Fee calculation being reduced to the extent of any net realized losses and net unrealized depreciation during the applicable three-year period. 
 In addition to reviewing the appropriateness of the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the relative performance of the Adviser and the Company, our board of directors considered the differentiated investment strategy of the Company, which focuses on generating both current income and capital appreciation by investing in debt and related equity investments of privately held middle-market companies. The Company invests primarily in middle-market companies in the form of standalone first and second lien loans and unitranche loans. The Company may also invest in unsecured debt and bonds and in the equity of portfolio companies through warrants and other instruments. The Company generally defines middle-market companies as those with an enterprise value that represents the aggregate of debt value and equity value of the entity of less than $750 million, although it may invest in larger or smaller companies. As of June 30, 2022, the Companys portfolio at fair value consisted of 91.94% first lien investments, 0% second lien investments, and 8.06% equity, warrant or other positions. 
 

 | Costs of Services Provided and Economies of Scale. Our board of directors considered the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the Company grows, and whether the fees payable under the Advisory Agreement reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of our stockholders. Taking into account such information, our board of directors determined that the advisory fee structure under the Advisory Agreement was reasonable with respect to any economies of scale that may be realized as the Company grows, and that there were no material economies of scale to be realized at the Companys current asset level.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Limited Potential for Additional Benefits Derived by the Adviser. Our board of directors considered existing and potential sources of indirect income the Adviser receive as a result of the relationship with us, including reimbursements to the Adviser of allocable expenses under the Administration Agreement, and whether there would be potential for additional benefits to be derived by the Adviser as a result of our relationship with the Adviser, and was advised any such potential would be limited.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
23 
 
Our board of directors concluded that the proposed advisory fees are reasonable, taking into consideration these other indirect benefits. 
 Conclusions. No single factor was determinative of the decision of our board of directors, including all of the Independent Directors, to approve the Advisory Agreement and individual directors may have weighed certain factors differently. 
Administration Agreement 
 Under the Administration Agreement, the Adviser furnishes us with office facilities and equipment and provides us with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, the Adviser performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which includes, among other things, being responsible for the financial and other records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports and other materials filed with the SEC. In addition, the Adviser assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports and other materials to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Under the Administration Agreement, the Adviser also provides managerial assistance on our behalf to those portfolio companies that have accepted our offer to provide such assistance. The Adviser may satisfy certain of its obligations under the Administration Agreement to us through the Investcorp Services Agreement, including supplying us with accounting and back-office professionals upon the request of the Adviser. 
 Payments under the Administration Agreement equal an amount based upon our allocable portion (subject to the review of our board of directors) of the Advisers overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. In addition, if requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, the Adviser will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided, which shall not exceed the amount we receive from such portfolio companies for providing this assistance. The Administration Agreement has an initial term of two years and may be renewed with the approval of our board of directors. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other party. To the extent that the Adviser outsources any of its functions, we pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without any incremental profit to the Adviser. 
 Indemnification 
 The Administration Agreement provides that, absent criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, the Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of the Advisers services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our administrator. 
License Agreement 
 We have entered into a license agreement with the Adviser under which the Adviser has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Investcorp. Under this agreement, we have a right to use the Investcorp name for so long as the Adviser or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the Investcorp name. This license agreement will remain in effect for so long as the Advisory Agreement with the Adviser is in effect and Investcorp is the majority owner of the Adviser.

Exchange Act Reports 
 We maintain a website at www.icmbdc.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K.
We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC in accordance with the Exchange Act. These include our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC. 
 Regulation as a BDC 
 We are a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
 We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an underwriter as that term is defined in the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder. Prior to January 19, 2021, except for registered money market funds, we generally were prohibited from acquiring more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, investing more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company, or investing more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company without obtaining exemptive relief from the SEC. However, the SEC adopted new rules, which became effective on January 19, 2021, that allow us to acquire the securities of other investment companies in excess of the 3%, 5%, and 10% limitations without obtaining exemptive relief if we comply with certain conditions. If we invest in securities issued by investment companies, if any, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses as they will be indirectly responsible for the costs and expenses of such companies. None of these policies is fundamental and may be changed without stockholder approval upon 60 days prior written notice to stockholders. 
 Qualifying Assets 
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the companys total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. Under the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, eligible portfolio companies include (1) private domestic operating companies, (2) public domestic operating companies whose securities are not listed
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
25 
 

on a national securities exchange (e.g., NASDAQ), and (3) public domestic operating companies having a market capitalization of less than $250 million. Public domestic operating companies whose securities are quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board or through Pink Sheets LLC are not listed on a national securities exchange and therefore are eligible portfolio companies.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident to such a private transaction, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities that mature in one year or less from the date of investment.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area. 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 Business development companies generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the business development company controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the business development company, through its directors, officers, employees or agents, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. The Adviser will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. 
Temporary Investments 
 Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets or temporary investments. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as the agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. The Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
 
26 
 
Senior Securities 
 We are generally permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. 
 In accordance with the 1940 Act, on May 2, 2018, our board of directors, including a required majority, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, our asset coverage requirements for senior securities changed from 200% to 150%, effective May 2, 2019. For more information, see Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Business and Structure  Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Risk Factors  Risks Relating to our Business and Structure  Regulations governing our operation as a business development company will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. As a business development company, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage. 
 Common Stock 
 We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock (i) in connection with a rights offering to our existing stockholders, (ii) with the consent of the majority of our common stockholders, or (iii) under such other circumstances as the SEC may permit. For example, we may sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then current net asset value of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve our policy and practice of making such sales. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). 
Codes of Ethics 
 We and the Adviser have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each such code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with such codes requirements. Each code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SECs website at www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of each code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov. 
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to the Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of the Adviser are set out below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by the Adviser and our directors who are not interested persons, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
Introduction 
 As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, the Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in our best interests. As part of this duty, the Adviser recognizes that it must vote our securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests. 
 
27 
 
The Advisers policies and procedures for voting proxies for its investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
 Proxy Policies 
 The Adviser votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. The Adviser reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities we hold. In most cases, the Adviser will vote in favor of proposals that the Adviser believes are likely to increase the value of the portfolio securities we hold. Although the Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative effect on our portfolio securities, the Adviser may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 The Adviser has established a proxy voting committee and adopted proxy voting guidelines and related procedures. The proxy voting committee establishes proxy voting guidelines and procedures, oversees the internal proxy voting process, and reviews proxy voting issues. To ensure that the Advisers vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, the Adviser requires that (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision- making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how the Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest may be present, the Adviser will disclose such conflicts to us, including to our Independent Directors, and may request guidance from us on how to vote such proxies. 
 Proxy Voting Records 
 You may obtain information about how the Adviser voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Investcorp Credit Management BDC, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 280 Park Avenue, 39th Floor, New York, New York 10017, or by calling us collect at (646) 690-5034. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains this information. 
 Privacy Principles 
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
 Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator). 
 We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to employees of the Adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We intend to maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders. 
 Other 
 We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such persons office. 
 
28 
 
We and the Adviser are each required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of relevant federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 
 We may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. Thus, based on current SEC interpretations, co-investment transactions involving a BDC like us and an entity that is advised by the Adviser or an affiliated adviser generally could not be effected without SEC relief. The staff of the SEC has, however, granted no-action relief permitting purchases of a single class of privately placed securities, provided that the adviser negotiates no term other than price and certain other conditions are met. On July 20, 2021, the SEC issued an order, which superseded a prior order issued on March 19, 2019, granting the Companys application for exemptive relief to co-invest, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, in certain private placement transactions with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates and any future funds that are advised by the Adviser or its affiliated investment advisers (the Exemptive Relief). Under the terms of the Exemptive Relief, in order for the Company to participate in a co-investment transaction a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Independent Directors must conclude that (i) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the interests of the Companys stockholders and is consistent with the Companys investment objectives and strategies. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 
 

 | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company 
 As a BDC, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the Annual Distribution Requirement). 
 If we qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 
 
29 
 
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years (the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement). 
 In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 
 

 | continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain qualified publicly traded partnerships, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the 90% Income Test); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain qualified publicly traded partnerships (the Diversification Tests).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 
 Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy the distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted in certain circumstances to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain asset coverage tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
 In accordance with certain applicable Treasury regulations and a revenue procedure issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% (10% for distributions made on or after November 1, 2021, and on or before June 30, 2022) of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing to receive cash must 
 
30 
 
 receive a pro rata amount of cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than 20% (or 10%, if applicable) of his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these Treasury regulations or the revenue procedure. 
 Failure to Maintain our Qualification as a RIC 
 If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes or to dispose of certain assets). 
 If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income that, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20% maximum rate to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits provided certain holding period and other requirements were met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholders tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the nonqualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent five years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC.
