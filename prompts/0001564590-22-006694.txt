ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
 All references to “LSB Industries,” “LSB,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to LSB Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes clear that the reference is only to LSB Industries, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries. Notes referenced throughout this document refer to consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures that are found in Item 8.
 The Company was formed in 1968 as an Oklahoma corporation and became a Delaware corporation in 1977. We manufacture and market chemical products for the agricultural, industrial and mining markets. We own and operate three multi plant facilities in El Dorado, Arkansas (the “El Dorado Facility”), Cherokee, Alabama (the “Cherokee Facility”), and Pryor, Oklahoma (the “Pryor Facility”), and we operate a facility on behalf of Covestro LLC (“Covestro”) in Baytown, Texas (the “Baytown Facility”). Our products are sold through distributors and directly to end customers throughout the United States and parts of Mexico and Canada.
 Our Business
 Our business manufactures products for three principal markets:
  
• | Agricultural Markets: ammonia, fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate (“AN” and “HDAN”) and urea ammonia nitrate (“UAN”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Industrial Markets: high purity and commercial grade ammonia, high purity AN, sulfuric acids, concentrated, blended and regular nitric acid, mixed nitrating acids, carbon dioxide, and diesel exhaust fluid (“DEF”); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mining Markets: industrial grade AN (“LDAN”) and AN solutions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 The products we manufacture at our facilities are primarily derived from natural gas (a raw material feedstock). Our facilities and production processes have been designed to produce products that are marketable at nearly each stage of production. This design has allowed us to develop and deploy a business model optimizing the mix of products to capture the value opportunities in the end markets we serve with a focus on balancing our production. 
 The chart below highlights representative products and applications in each of our end markets.
 
 
End Market | Products | Applications 
Agricultural | UAN, HDAN and ammonia | Fertilizer and fertilizer blends for corn and other crops; NPK fertilizer blends


Industrial | Nitric acid, metallurgical and commercial grade ammonia, sulfuric acid, diesel exhaust fluid and other urea solutions, Specialty E-2 ammonium nitrate and CO2 | Semi-conductor and polyurethane intermediates, ordnance; Pulp and paper, alum, water treatment, metals and vanadium processing; Power plant emissions abatement, water treatment, refrigerants, metals processing; Exhaust stream additive, horticulture / greenhouse applications; refrigeration
Mining | LDAN, AN solution and HDAN | Ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) and specialty emulsions for mining applications, surface mining, quarries, and construction

 Our Strategy 
 We pursue a strategy of balancing the sale of product as fertilizer into the agriculture markets at spot prices or short duration pre-sales and developing industrial and mining customers that purchase substantial quantities of products, primarily under contractual obligations and/or pricing arrangements that generally provide for the pass through of some raw material and other manufacturing costs. We believe this product and market diversification strategy allows us to have more consistent levels of production compared to some of our competitors and helps reduce the volatility risk inherent in the prices of our raw material feedstock and/or the changes in demand for our products. 
 The strategy of developing industrial and mining customers helps to moderate the risk inherent in the agricultural markets where spot sales prices of our agricultural products may not have a correlation to the natural gas feedstock costs but rather reflect market conditions for like and competing nitrogen sources. This volatility of sales pricing in our agricultural products may, from time to time, compromise our ability to recover our full cost to produce the product. Additionally, the lack of sufficient non-seasonal agricultural sales volume to operate our manufacturing facilities at optimum levels can preclude us from balancing production and storage capabilities. Looking forward, we remain focused on upgrading margins by maximizing downstream production. Our strategy calls for further development of industrial customers who assume the volatility risk associated with the raw material costs and mitigate the effects of seasonality in the agricultural sector.
 Our strategy also includes evaluating and pursuing acquisitions of strategic assets or companies, mergers with other companies and investment in additional production capacity where we believe those acquisitions, mergers or expansion of production capacity will enhance the value of the Company and provide appropriate returns.
 Key Operating Initiatives for 2022
 As discussed in more detail under “Key Operating Initiatives for 2022” of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) contained in Item 7 of this report, we believe our future results of operations and financial condition will depend significantly on our ability to successfully implement the following key initiatives: 
  
• | Investing in Safety and Reliability at our Facilities to further our Progress Towards Becoming a “Best in Class” Chemical Plant Operator Supplying our Customers with Products of the Highest Quality.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue Broadening the Distribution and Optimization of our Product mix.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Development and Implementation of a Strategy to Capitalize on Low Carbon Ammonia and Clean Energy Opportunities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue Acquisition of Strategic Assets or Companies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 As for our liquidity, we had approximately $143.5 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity at the end of 2021, which we believe provides us with ample liquidity to fund our operations and meet our current obligations. Also see discussions under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” of our MD&A.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 Strategically Located Chemical Assets and Long-Standing Customer Relationships
 Our business benefits from highly advantageous locations with logistical and distribution benefits. We have access to the Nustar ammonia pipeline from the U.S. Gulf at our El Dorado Facility, which provides low-cost transportation to distribution points. The El Dorado Facility also has rail access providing favorable freight logistics to our industrial and agricultural customers and cost advantaged when selling a number of our products West of the Mississippi River. Our Cherokee Facility is located east of the Mississippi River, allowing it to reach customers that are not freight logical for others. Our Cherokee Facility sits adjacent to the Tennessee River, providing barge receipt and shipping access, in addition to truck and rail delivery access. Our Pryor Facility is located in the heart of the Southern Plains with close proximity to the Port of Catoosa along with strategic rail and truck delivery access.

Advantaged Raw Material Cost Position
 We produce ammonia at our El Dorado, Cherokee and Pryor Facilities, which allows us to take advantage of the spread between producing and purchasing ammonia at those facilities. 
Diversified Sources of Revenue
 Our business serves a broad range of end markets, which we believe diminishes the cyclicality of our financial performance. Our business serves the agricultural, industrial and mining markets. The flexible nature of our production process and storage capability allows us the ability to shift our product mix based on end market demand. 
Operation of Multiple Facilities and High Production Capacity 
 We operate our business through several facilities. Operating multiple facilities diversifies the risk and impact of operational issues that may occur at a single plant, which gives us a strategic advantage over competitors that operate their company through a single facility. Additionally, our competitive production capacity of our combined plants allows us to decrease manufacturing costs, helping us to achieve enhanced margins.
Agricultural Market Conditions 
 As discussed in more detail under “Key Industry Factors” of MD&A, the price at which our agricultural products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers which, in turn, depends upon world grain demand and production levels, the cost and availability of transportation and storage, weather conditions, competitive pricing and the availability of imports. Additionally, expansions or upgrades of competitors’ facilities and international and domestic political and economic developments continue to play an important role in the global nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can affect, in addition to selling prices, the level of inventories in the market which can cause price volatility and affect product margins. 
 Looking forward to 2022, corn prices for the vast majority of 2021 remained above levels not seen since 2014, and at current prices exceeding $6 per bushel, are significantly above the $4 per bushel level that we believe represents a very favorable level for farmers to earn significant income on their crops. The strong corn prices over the past year have been driven, in part, by a rebound in the production of ethanol, a gasoline additive that represents approximately 40% of total U.S. corn use annually, as miles driven have returned to near pre-pandemic levels. Also supporting the strong corn pricing over the past year has been Chinese demand for corn for use as feed for swine as part of the nation’s efforts to rebuild its swine production in the wake of a virus that dramatically reduced its swine population several years ago. This demand for feed is expected to remain robust as China has moved to large institutional hog farms which consume significant quantities of corn. Globally, corn supplies have been constrained by drought conditions in South America and the Western U.S., which has served to further bolster corn prices. Early forecasts point to U.S. corn acreage to be planted in the 2022-2023 planting season to be approximately 90 to 92 million acres, modestly lower than the 2021-2022 estimate of 93.4 million acres, but still at a very healthy level to support strong demand for fertilizers. 
 Agricultural Products 
 We produce and sell UAN, HDAN and ammonia, all of which are nitrogen-based fertilizers. We sell these agricultural products to farmers, ranchers, fertilizer dealers and distributors primarily in the ranch land and grain production markets in the U.S. Our nitrogen-based fertilizers are used to grow food crops, biofuel feedstock crops, pasture land for grazing livestock and forage production. We maintain long-term relationships with wholesale agricultural distributors and retailers and also sell directly to agricultural end-users through our network of wholesale and retail distribution centers. 
 The price at which our agricultural products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers which, in turn, depends upon world grain demand and production levels, the cost and availability of transportation and storage, weather conditions, competitive pricing and the availability of imports. Additionally, expansions or upgrades of competitors’ facilities combined with international and domestic political and economic developments continue to play an important role in the global nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can affect, in addition to selling prices, the level of inventories in the market which can cause price volatility and affect product margins. 
 We develop our market position in these areas by emphasizing high quality products, customer service and technical advice. 
 In addition, we have an agreement with a third-party purchaser, Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers, LLC, (“CVR”), to market and sell a portion of our UAN. Demand for sales under this agreement is based on the expected needs of the purchaser’s customers. The agreement provides the exclusive right (but not the obligation) to purchase, at market prices, substantially all of the UAN produced at our Pryor Facility. The term of the agreement runs through June 2022, with automatic one-year extensions, subject to a 180-day advance notice of termination from CVR or a 90-day advance notice from us.
 We sell most of our agricultural products at the current spot market price in effect at the time of shipment, although we periodically enter into forward sales commitments for some of these products.

Industrial and Mining Market Conditions
 As discussed in more detail under “Key Industry Factors” of MD&A, in our industrial markets, our sales volumes are typically driven by changes in general economic conditions, energy prices, metals market prices and our contractual arrangements with certain large customers. In our mining markets, our sales volumes are typically driven by changes in the overall North American consumption levels of mining products that can be impacted by weather. Additionally, changes in natural gas prices and demand in renewable power sources, such as wind and solar in the electrical generation sector, will impact demand for our mining products and impact competition within the other sectors of this market. 
 Looking forward to 2022, selling prices have continued to improve as the supply of ammonia remains tight due to strong global demand, curtailed global supply due to rising natural gas prices, numerous global unplanned outages and lower than expected product imports. As a result, the Tampa Ammonia benchmark price increased to, and remains at multi-year high levels, which has translated into higher selling prices for our products as many of our industrial contracts are indexed to this benchmark price. Demand trends for the industrial products we sell, primarily nitric acid and ammonia, have remained robust despite disruptions to certain end markets, such as auto manufacturing which has been constrained due to a shortage of microprocessors, as activity in other markets, such as homebuilding and power generation has remained strong. In addition, our sales of nitric acid increased steadily throughout 2021 pursuant to the new long-term nitric acid supply contract discussed below. Demand for our mining products continues to improve as quarry and construction activity has been elevated due to robust levels of residential, commercial and civil infrastructure buildout along with strong demand for precious metals, including expectations for rising copper production to support the growing domestic production of electronic vehicles.
Industrial and Mining Products
 We manufacture and sell industrial acids and other chemical products primarily to the polyurethane intermediates, paper, fibers, emission control, and electronics industries. In addition, we produce and sell blended and regular nitric acid and industrial and high purity ammonia for many specialty applications, including the reduction of air emissions from power plants.
 Sales of our industrial and mining products are generally made to customers pursuant to sales contracts or pricing arrangements on terms that include the cost of the primary raw materials as a pass-through component in the sales price. These contractual sales stabilize the effect of commodity cost changes and fluctuations in demand for these products due to the cyclicality of the end markets.
 During 2020, one of our subsidiaries, El Dorado Chemical Company (“EDC”) entered into a contract with a customer to supply nitric acid. Under the agreement, EDC will supply between 70,000 to 100,000 tons of nitric acid annually. The initial contract term began in January 2021 and extends through 2027 and includes automatic one-year renewal terms.
 In addition, EDC and Koch Fertilizer LLC (“Koch Fertilizer”) are parties to an ammonia purchase and sale agreement, under which Koch Fertilizer agreed to purchase, with minimum purchase requirements, a portion of the ammonia that is in excess of EDC’s internal needs. The term of the agreement runs until June 2023, with annual renewal options thereafter.
We operate the Baytown Facility on behalf of Covestro and we believe it is one of the largest and most technologically advanced nitric acid manufacturing units in the U.S. We operate and maintain this facility pursuant to a long-term operating contract. The term of this agreement runs until October 2029 with options for renewal.
 Our industrial products sales volumes are dependent upon general economic conditions primarily in the housing, automotive, and paper industries. Our sale prices generally vary with the market price of ammonia, sulfur or natural gas, as applicable, in our pricing arrangements with customers. 
 Our industrial business competes based upon service, price and location of production and distribution sites, product quality and performance and provides inventory management as part of the value-added services offered to certain customers.
 We also produce and sell LDAN, HDAN and AN solution to the mining industry, which are primarily used as AN fuel oil and specialty emulsions for usage in the quarry and the construction industries, for metals mining, and to a lesser extent, for coal mining. We have signed long-term contracts with certain customers that provide for the annual sale of LDAN, which a portion include various natural-gas-based pricing arrangements. One of our customers has a plant located at our El Dorado Facility. 
 Raw Materials
 The products we manufacture at our facilities are primarily derived from natural gas. This raw material feedstock is a commodity and subject to price fluctuations. Natural gas is the primary raw material for producing ammonia, UAN, nitric acid and acid blends and other products at our El Dorado, Cherokee and Pryor Facilities. For 2021, we purchased approximately 28.3 million MMBtus of natural gas.
 The chemical facilities’ natural gas feedstock requirements are generally purchased at spot market price. Periodically, we enter into volume purchase commitments and/or forward contracts to lock in the cost of certain of the expected natural gas requirements primarily to match quantities needed to produce product that has been sold forward. At December 31, 2021, we had natural gas contracts of approximately 5.4 million MMBtus, at an average cost of $4.53 per MMBtu. These contracts extend through March 2022.

 Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive market with many other larger chemical companies, such as Austin Powder Company, CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Chemtrade Logistics L.L.C.; Cornerstone Chemical, Eco Services Operation Corp., a subsidiary of PQ Holding Group, OCI Partners NV, Dyno Nobel, a subsidiary of Incitec Pivot Limited, The Gavilon Group, Helm AG, Koch Industries, Norfalco, Nutrien, Orica Limited; Praxair, Inc., Quad Chemical Corporation, Southern States Chemical, Trammo Inc. and Veolia North America (some of whom are our customers), many of whom have greater financial and other resources than we do. We believe that competition within the markets we serve is primarily based upon service, price, location of production and distribution sites, and product quality and performance.
Human Capital Management
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed 545 persons, 180 of whom are represented by unions under agreements, including agreements being negotiated, that expire in July 2022 through July 2024. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.
 
Oversight & Management
 Our success depends on the capabilities and strength of our workforce. Our Human Resources Director is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This strategy includes the acquisition, development, and retention of talent to deliver on our overall strategy. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) regularly updates our Board of Directors (“Board”) on the operation and status of these human capital activities including:

• | Training & Development – We are committed to the continued development of our employees. Quarterly reviews of operations and talent occur across all operational business units and corporate functions. It is the responsibility of the CEO and the executive staff to review talent data on an annual basis and plan development actions to ensure succession and continuous improvement and growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engagement – We believe that we have favorable relations with our employees. Approximately 33% of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. We take proactive measures, such as conducting employee surveys to understand and drive employee engagement. Additionally, we conduct benefit surveys annually in an effort to ensure that any changes to benefits are improvements or add value for employees. Each of our business units conducts roundtable discussions to develop action plans to improve the work environment. We have continued to increase our communication efforts with employees, which our workforce has recognized favorably. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Health and Safety – Our Health and Safety Management System continues to build to establish a consistent approach to enhance the work environment, culture and compliance at each business unit. This system is guided by a newly formed executive committee that provides focus and priority to compliance and industry best practices that protect our employees while performing work within our operations. Each business team is responsible for evaluating its unique operations and applying the defined controls to engage employees and manage injury risk. We use leading and lagging metrics, such as near miss tracking, assigning potential risk consequences to events, incident tracking, and releases to monitor our performance and effectiveness across our operations and individual business teams. Events are investigated based on risk using root cause analysis tools and corrective actions are tracked to ensure prevention. In addition, the management system includes periodic third-party audits and internal self-assessment to continuously improve.

 Like many other companies, we have experienced challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and have focused energy and effort on protecting our employees and their families from potential virus exposure while continuing safe and compliant operations. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we established detailed plans and protocols, executed remote work arrangements, and increased communication to employees. To date, our focused actions, which have aligned with the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have not resulted in any work stoppage.
 Government Laws and Regulations
 Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters regarding environmental, health and safety, many of which provide for certain performance obligations, substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Certain of these laws and regulations impose strict liability as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. 
 There can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in complying with such laws or in paying fines or penalties for violation of such laws. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. These laws and regulations (including enforcement policies thereunder) have
