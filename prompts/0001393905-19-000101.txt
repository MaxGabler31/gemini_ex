  Item 1. Description of Business
  The business of the Company is primarily that of a holding company with subsidiaries. The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, National Five Holding Ltd, holds a 60 percent share interest in Northstar Sealand Enterprises Ltd (NSEL). NSEL has been incorporated to pursue a manufacturing, marketing, sales and maintenance opportunity in the aviation industry and is in negotiations with a major aviation company.  Corporate History
 The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar Network Ltd., (NNL), had carried out defense, aerospace and homeland security contract manufacturing. NNL has been discontinued due to insufficient working capital, quality issues with suppliers and design changes made by the customer.   Our second wholly owned subsidiary Northstar Technical Inc., (NTI), had been involved in underwater sonar sensors primarily related to the fishing industry. NTI has been discontinued due to several issues in the commercial fishing industry. The time taken for new technology developments using underwater communicating techniques was long. The timeframe for market introduction was also lengthy. Although NTIs sonar system was initially a success in a fast changing industry, NTI could not keep up with the larger competitors products. The Company did not consummate the signing of a Letter of Intent to acquire a development stage company specializing in advanced sonar technologies and systems.  1   Homeland Security and Military Defense:
 The Company had expected that design and manufacture of homeland security and anti-terrorism systems would have grown rapidly as the United States Department of Homeland Security and the United States Navy had planned to ramp up efforts to protect ports, other onshore high value assets and ships. In partnership with a division of Lockheed Martin Corp,, we responded to a Request for Quote by the USN and they gave us the highest assessment. We sold several systems but the DHS took the USNs budget meant to purchase our systems and use the funds for the war in Iraq. This also happened the following year and subsequently the USN cancelled the program.  DESIGN ENGINEERING AND CONTRACT MANUFACTURING  The Company has considerable experience in contract manufacturing and has produced electronic and mechanical systems under contract to defense and aerospace companies. Products were built according to designs provided by our customers for whom the Company provided production engineering, contract manufacturing of components, sourcing and procurement of parts, assembly of full systems, testing and shipping.   For several customers, Northstar was carrying out electronic and mechanical design work.    The Companys former customers included Lockheed Martin MS2, Lockheed Martin Canada, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics and L-3.  NEW DIRECTION
 The Company expended considerable efforts during the past year in developing operational knowledge of a particular industrial single engine Turbo Prop airplane., conducting research into Supply Chain Management Systems applicable to this project, carrying out market research in different geographical areas, in conducting research into the most efficient procedures to obtain the Type Certificate for the airplane and in developing the most cost effective ways to carry out production of the airplane.   We are now moving in a new direction whereby we intend to build our own systems in the civilian aviation sector. We believe that this affords improved control over the business outcomes compared to the contract manufacturing business.  The Company is working to obtain worldwide rights to a single engine Turbo Prop airplane with industrial applications. If successful, we intend to manufacture and market the airplane internationally and provide Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services in close proximity to customers. The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, National Five Holding Ltd, is a 60% shareholder of Northstar Sealand Enterprises Ltd (NSEL). NSEL, has experience in working on certified commercial aircraft and government military contracts, and has access to an established aircraft assembly and parts manufacturing facility.  Airplane Applications The airplanes are designed to carry out Rapid Response Forest Fire Fighting and Agriculture Crop Dusting. We are looking into other applications including Cloud Seeding.    2   Marketing
 NSEL has started market assessments in several large international markets where there appears to be volume sales potential for the single engine airplane. They have also begun to explore potential marketing partnerships with other aviation companies. Projections made by NSEL show a potential growth in demand for suitable single engine aircraft, subject to economic factors. Preliminary plans have been started on methods to achieve market presence, including direct sales, magazine ads, web site, and participation in trade shows.   Technology Protection
 The Company currently owns no proprietary technology requiring protection with respect to its activities. It intends to acquire proprietary technology and, if successful, intends to put appropriate protection measures in place.  Need for Government Approvals
 If the Company is successful in acquiring the rights to the aforementioned single engine airplane, there will be required government approvals applicable to our expected future activities.  The approvals would likely be for an in-country Type Certificate and other certificates, as required, in other countries where the airplane would be marketed.  Effect of Existing or Probable Government Regulations
  If successful with the acquisition of the rights to the single engine airplane, the Company intends to abide by the applicable regulations in each country where it intends to carry out marketing and sales. The costs of meeting the regulatory requirements can be high and the Company will do its best efforts to procure the funds required.  Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 The Company incurred no costs or adverse effects in its compliance with any environmental laws.  PRODUCTION  The Company has experience in carrying out work requiring multiple subcontractors to perform specialized tasks. The ability to integrate the work of multiple components to create a complete system will be NSELs main area of business - system integration.  EMPLOYEES  As of December 31, 2018 the Company has a team of experienced consultants who provide administration, marketing and engineering services to the Company.  PUBLIC INFORMATION  The Company electronically files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) all its reports, including but not limited to its annual and quarterly reports. The SEC maintains an internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports and other information regarding issuers that do file electronically.
