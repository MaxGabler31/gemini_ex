Item 1. Business Our Mission

Our mission is to bring together the worlds of online e-commerce and offline physical retailers; widening consumer choice and rewarding loyalty, while sustaining and enhancing our earning potential.
Our Company 

We have created an innovative online-to-offline (“O2O”) e-commerce platform business model offering consumers and merchants instant rebates and affiliate cashback programs, while providing a seamless e-payment solution with rebates in both e-commerce (i.e., online) and physical retailers/merchant (i.e., offline) settings.

Our proprietary product is an internet application (or “App”) branded “ZCITY App”, which was developed through our wholly owned subsidiary, Gem Reward Sdn. Bhd. (“GEM”). The ZCITY App was successfully launched in Malaysia in June 2020. GEM is equipped with the know-how and expertise to develop additional/add-on technology-based products and services to complement the ZCITY App, thereby growing its reach and user base.


Through simplifying a user’s e-payment gateway experience, as well as by providing great deals, rewards and promotions with every use, we aim to make the ZCITY App Malaysia’s top reward and payment gateway platform. Our longer-term goal is for the ZCITY App and its ever-developing technology to become one of the most well-known commercialized applications more broadly in Southeast Asia and Japan.

 As of December 5, 2022, we had over 2,312,114 registered users and over 1,998 registered merchants.
Corporate Structure

Treasure Global, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on March 20, 2020. We issued 10,000,000 shares to Kok  Pin “Darren” Tan, our founder and former Chief Executive Officer on July 1, 2020, who as a result became our sole shareholder. As of December 5, 2022, we had a total of   92 full time employees.
Gem Reward Sdn. Bhd. (“GEM”), a Malaysia private limited company was incorporated on June 6, 2017. Prior to the incorporation of GEM, Kok Pin “Darren” Tan entered into a Beneficial Shareholding Agreement (“Beneficial Shareholding Agreement 1”) with two individuals, one of which is a vice president of the Company (the “Initial GEM Shareholders”), which provided for the Initial Shareholders to hold the GEM shares issued to them in equal amounts and for the sole benefit of Kok Pin “Darren” Tan and provided Kok Pin “Darren” Tan with control over the voting and disposition over such shares as well as control over the issuance of additional GEM shares in consideration for equity in a company that had not been determined on the date of Beneficial Shareholding Agreement 1. On November 10, 2020, Kok Pin “Darren” Tan instructed the Initial GEM Shareholders to issue 1 million additional GEM shares to shares to Chong  Chan “Sam” Teo, currently our Chief Executive Officer, and as a result each Initial GEM Shareholder and Chong Chan “Sam” Teo held 1 million shares of GEM. On November 10, 2020 Chong Chan “Sam” Teo entered into a Beneficial Shareholding Agreement with Kok Pin “Darren” Tan with terms similar to Beneficial Shareholding Agreement 1 (“Beneficial Shareholding Agreement 2” and together with the Beneficial Shareholding Agreement 1, “Beneficial Shareholding Agreements”). As a result of Kok Pin “Darren” Tan’s 100% ownership of our common stock and the Beneficial Shareholding Agreements, TGI and GEM were both under the sole control of Kok Pin “Darren” Tan.

TGI and GEM were reorganized into a parent subsidiary structure pursuant to a Share Swap Agreement, dated March 11, 2021, as amended on March 11, 2021 among TGI, the Initial GEM Shareholders and Chong Chan “Sam” Teo (the “Share Swap Agreement”), in which TGI exchanged 321,585 shares of its common stock (the “Swap Shares”) for all equity of GEM. Pursuant to the Share Swap Agreement, the purchase and sale of the Swap Shares was completed on March 11, 2021, but the issuance of the Swap Shares did not occur until October 27, 2021 when TGI amended its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of its authorized common stock to a number that was sufficient to issue the Swap Shares. As a result of the Share Swap Agreement, (i) GEM became the 100% subsidiary of TGI and Kok Pin “Darren” Tan no longer had any control over GEM’s ordinary shares; and (ii) Kok Pin “Darren” Tan, the Initial GEM Shareholders and Chong Chan “Sam” Teo owned 100% of the TGI common stock (Kok Pin “Darren” Tan owning 97%). Subsequent to the date of the Share Swap Agreement, Kok Pin “Darren” Tan transferred 9,529,002 of his 10,000,000 shares of TGI common stock to 16 individuals and entities and currently owns less than 5% of our common stock.

We operate solely through GEM. GEM owns all intellectual property rights to copyrightable, patentable, and other protectable intangible assets relating to our business, including trademarks.

Market Opportunity

We expect that continued strong economic expansion, robust population growth, rising level of urbanization, the emergence of the middle class and the increasing rate of adoption of mobile technology provide market opportunities for our Company in Southeast Asia (“SEA”). SEA is a large economy and, as of 2020, its gross domestic product (“GDP”) was US$3.08 trillion1. In comparison, the respective GDP for both the European Union (“EU”) and the United States (“US”) totalled US$15 trillion and US$20.89 trillion162 in 2020. SEA has experienced rapid economic growth rates in recent years, far exceeding growth in major world economies such as Japan, the EU and the US. According to the IMF, Malaysia’s GDP growth averaged more than 4.3% from 2016 to 2019, but contracted by 6.0% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is expected to average 5.7% growth for the next five years (including 2021).3 The GDP of Malaysia amounted to US$337 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach approximately US$500 billion by 2025.4

SEA continues to enjoy robust population growth. The United Nations Population Division estimates that the population of the SEA countries in 2000 was approximately 525 million people growing to 668 million in 2020. According to the World Bank, Malaysia had a population of approximately 32 million people in 2020 compared to 23 million people in 2000.5

A high percentage of Malaysians have lived in cities for the last decade and that percentage is increasing. Since 2010,6 Malaysia’s urbanization has increased from approximately 71% to approximately 77% in 2020. By comparison, in 2020 the urbanization rates for China, Vietnam and India were approximately 64%, 37% and 35%, respectively.7

Urbanization is highly correlated with the size and growth of the middle class. Simply put, urbanization drives middle class consumption demand. According to the World Bank, Malaysia is likely to transition from an upper-middle-income economy to a high-income economy between 2024 and 2028, a reflection of the country’s economic transformation development trajectory over past decades. In fact, Malaysia’s gross national income per capita is at US$11,200 according to latest estimates, only US$1,335 short of the current threshold level that defines a high-income economy.8

And despite the ongoing effects from the Covid-19 pandemic, the Internet economy continues to boom in SEA. According to Google Temasek e-Conomy SEA 2021 Report (the “Google Report”), internet usage in the region increased with 40 million new users added in 2021 for a total of 440 million compared to 360 million in 2019 and 400 million in 2020.249 Eighty nine percent of Malaysia’s population is now online, compared to approximately fifty six percent in 2010.2510 81% and 80% of Malaysia and SEA’s internet users, respectively, have made at least one purchase online. E-commerce, online media and food delivery adoption and usage surged with the total value of goods and services sold via the Internet, or gross merchandise value (“GMV”), in SEA, expected to reach approximately US$170 billion by year end 2021 according to the Google Report. In fact, according to the Google Report, the SEA Internet sector GMV is forecast to grow to over US$360 billion by 2025 up from the $300 billion forecast in the Google, Temasek, Bain SEA Report 2020.11

Malaysia’s internet economy has grown from $14 billion in 2020 to $21 billion in 2021 (47% growth) and is expected to grow to $35 billion in 2025.12

As consumers in these markets that gradually shifting towards online platforms model, the total value of internet-based transactions has grown tremendously and is expected to keep doing so. According to the Google Report, total GMV of South Asia’s Internet economy is expected to skyrocket from US$174 billion in 2021 to US$363 billion in 2025.

We believe that these ongoing positive economic and demographic trends in SEA and South Asia propel demand for our e-commerce platform.

About the ZCITY App

SEA consumers have access to a plethora of smart ordering, delivery and “loyalty” websites and apps, but in our experience, SEA consumers very rarely receive personalized deals based on their purchases and behavior.

The ZCITY App targets consumers through the provision of personalized deals based on consumers’ purchase history, location and preferences. Our technology platform allows us to identify the spending trends of our customers (the when, where, why, and how much). We are able to offer these personalized deals through the application of our proprietary artificial intelligence (or “AI”) technology that scours the available database to identify and create opportunities to extrapolate the greatest value from the data, analyze consumer behavior and roll out attractive rewards-based campaigns for targeted audiences. We believe this AI technology is currently a unique market differentiator for the ZCITY App.

We operate our ZCITY App on the hashtag: “#RewardsOnRewards”. We believe this branding demonstrates to users the ability to spend ZCITY App-based Reward Points (or “RP”) and “ZCITY Cash Vouchers” with discount benefits at checkout. Additionally, users can use RP while they earn rewards from selected e-Wallet or other payment methods.

ZCITY App users do not require any on-going credit top-up or need to provide bank card number with their binding obligations. We have partnered with Malaysia’s leading payment gateway, IPAY88, for secure and convenient transactions. Users can use our secure platform and enjoy cashless shopping experiences with rebates when they shop with e-commerce and retail merchants through trusted and leading e-wallet providers such as Touch’n Go eWallet, Boost eWallet, GrabPay eWallet and credit card/online banking like the “FPX” (the Malaysian Financial Process Exchange) as well as more traditional providers such as Visa and Mastercard.

ZCITY Apps’s Reward Points Program

Operating under the hashtag #RewardsOnRewards, we believe the ZCITY App reward points program encourages users to sign up the app, as well as increasing user engagement and spending on purchases/repeat purchases and engenders user loyalty.

Furthermore, we believe the simplicity of the steps to obtaining Reward Points (or “RP”) is an attractive incentive to user participation in that participants receive:


· | 200 RP for registration as a new user;
--+---------------------------------------


· | 100 RP for referral of a new user;
--+-----------------------------------


· | Conversion of Malaysian ringgit spent into RP;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | 50% RP of every referred user paid amount as a result of the referral; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Spin & Win eligibility to receive RP (which may be “doubled up” when participants share the Spin & Win program on social media).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 The key objectives of our RP are:

Offline Merchant

When using our ZCITY App to make payment to a registered physical merchant, the system will automatically calculate the amount of RP to deduct. The deducted RP amount is based on the percentage of profit sharing as with the merchant and the available RP of the user.
Online Merchant
 
When using our ZCITY App to pay utility bills or purchase any e-vouchers, our system shows the maximum RP deduction allowed and the user determines the amount of discount deducted subject to maximum deductions described below and the number of RP owned by such user.
 
Different features have different maximum deduction amounts. For example, for bill payments, the maximum deduction is up to 3% of the bill amount. For e-vouchers, the maximum deduction is up to 5% of the voucher amount.
 
In order to increase the spending power of the user, our ZCITY App RP program will credit RP to the user for all MYR paid.
 
Merchant Facing Business
 
At present, our ZCITY merchants are concentrated in the F&B and lifestyle sectors. Moving forward, we plan to expand our product/service offering to include grocery stores, convenience stores, “micro-SME” (“small to medium size enterprises”) loan programs, affiliate programs and advertising agencies.
 

We believe that ZCITY’s Tazte Smart F&B System, which we plan to launch in the fourth quarter of 2022, will provide merchants with a one-stop automated solution to digitalize their business. It will offer an innovative and integrated technology ecosystem that addresses and personalizes each merchant’s technological needs and will be at the forefront of creating a smart consumer experience, thereby eliminating conventional and outdated standalone point of sale (or “POS”) systems.
 
Tazte will allow merchants to effortlessly record transactions with online payment or QR digital payment technology, set discounts and execute RP redemptions and rewards online, all via our ZCITY App. It utilizes ZCITY App’s CRM analytics software to attract and retain consumers through personalized, data-driven engagement to generate greater profitability.
 
Tazte Smart F&B System will also feature a ‘Deviceless Queue System’ that reduces staff headcount and a private domain delivery service that will allow merchants access to multiple dedicated delivery partners to ensure outstanding delivery service to consumers.

Marketing Strategy - Consumer
 
With the number of available apps for download from the world’s leading app stores totaling over four million, we believe that structured and innovative user marketing strategy is the only way to stand out in today’s app market. Aside from focusing on app development and building our app features properly, we believe we need to get our app featured on the leading platforms to most successfully extend our reach and user base.
 
We believe that our ZCITY App marketing strategy covers the user from when they first learn about our ZCITY App, to when they become a regular repeat user. The marketing strategy for the ZCITY App involves defining our target audience, learning how best to reach them, how best to communicate with them, and analyzing their “in-app” behavior to make continuous AI driven improvements as users move through the recruitment funnel.
 
Ultimately, the goal of our ZCITY App marketing strategy is to acquire users that will not only drive repeat engagement, but will also become loyal advocates for the ZCITY App.
 
At the initial launch of the ZCITY App in June 2020, we combined both online and offline strategies in branding and marketing, which we believed would effectively communicate our objectives, reaching a prospective target audience and turning that target audience into users of our ZCITY App.
 
Other than just user experience and features offered in the app itself, we believe consumers are choosing brands whose messaging, marketing and values go beyond the product, and have a potentially deeper meaning to the user. For example, they may consider brand trustworthiness and identity to be major influences on their market decisions. As a result, we have focused on building brand loyalty to drive on going marketing success, increase repeat users and attain greater market share.
 
In this regard, we have chosen to adapt various marketing strategies, such as re-targeting users and enticing current users to use our app on multiple occasions, by providing what users look for when they choose our app in order to increase engagement and retention. The diagram below reflects the strategies we engage in to promote marketing success and avoid missed opportunities.
 

We adopt a multi-pronged approach to user outreach through outdoor digital billboards, radio commercials, third party editorials and advertorials, social media postings on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, as well as the targeting of users through Google ads and direct email marketing to encourage downloads and promote various campaigns.

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been very focused on reaching our target audience through digital media due to movement restrictions and retail closures. Advertisements especially on social media have become more routine.
 

Social media-based advertising can be very targeted, helping to convert new users into repeat users and building brand loyalty. We reach potential users based on criteria, including, among others, job title, interests, marital status, and recent locations. We believe that it is much easier to measure and optimize social media campaigns while they are active. If an advertisement isn’t producing expected results, we can suspend the campaign or reallocate funds on demand.
 
Another key media vehicle that we utilize is Universal App Campaign (or “UAC”) by Google. UAC helps promote our ZCITY App across Google’s largest properties including Google Search, Google Play Store, YouTube, and the Google Display Network. It combines information Google has on users’ tendencies and perceived intents outside of the app (such as what they have searched for, what other apps they have downloaded and what they watched on YouTube) with advertisers’ information on user actions in the app.
 
UAC then uses machine learning technology to make decisions for each ad by analyzing potential data signal combinations in real-time, including the platform where users are most likely to engage with our ad (such as YouTube or Gmail), the right ad format (whether video, text, or combination of the two) and keywords that will perform best for our marketing goals.

In addition, in order to obtain more accurate data for analysis, AppsFlyer SDK is installed in our ZCITY App, where it provides conversion data of user acquisition and retention campaigns. Through AppsFlyer SDK, we can monitor digital media activities to optimize our marketing budget. The data can be utilized and turned into actionable insights (to run campaigns and promotions which users are more favorable to) that will share our strategic and tactical business decisions, while boosting the ZCITY App brand presence.
 

Marketing Strategy - Merchants “6Cs” Strategy
 
In order to roll out our system, we plan to implement our 6Cs marketing strategy: clients, convenience, competition, consistency with creative content, corporate social responsibilities and credibility.
 
Clients (Soon-to-be F&B Owners). We have forecast potential merchants by category, which will enable us to create a marketing plan that will attract them by aligning our promotional content with their business interests and ideals. We will initiate advertisements that connect with their preferences and generate brand loyalty. We have developed “The PILOT” program where we plan offer prospective merchant F&B owners a free Tazte Smart F&B system to facilitate their O2O business.
 
Convenience. We plan to demonstrate the convenience provided by our ZCITY App by launching a digitalization initiative which can get a merchant up and running on our platform within 24 hours. We believe this strategy emphasizes the ease of onboarding potential merchants and the potential positive transformation of their business in the shortest amount of time.
 
Competition. To further differentiate our system from our competitors, we expect to identify, compare and discover issues within their business model of operations against our own business model. The “SWITCH 180” program is where we plan to offer F&B owners not only a free Tazte Smart F&B system, but we will also offer additional support such as artificial intelligence inventory management system and discount vouchers.
 
Consistency with Creative Content. We plan to maintain a consistent brand image across all our current marketing approaches with creative and innovative content. We strive to make our brand recognizable to stand out among competitors to increase brand awareness and recognition.
 
Corporate Social Responsibilities. We expect to integrate social and environmental concerns in our business operations to gain positive publicity and recognition and greater market exposure. For example, our “Love Delivery” program under Tazte will allow consumers to donate food through our merchant family to charitable establishments such as orphanages and senior centers and similar charitable organizations. Our “Green Oil” program will allow our merchants to contribute to zero pollution by recycling used cooking oil with one of our strategic partners.
 


13
--

 

Credibility. We expect to prove our credibility by presenting our expertise to potential merchants who are seeking alternative business strategies in the ever-expanding technological age. We believe that promoting a credible and reliable system for merchants will increase referrals and positive reviews. Our “Tazte Cares <3” program offers F&B owners free business operations “health checks” and offers troubleshooting solutions by introducing Tazte Smart F&B System into their business.

ZCITY’s revenues are generated from a diversified mix of:


· | e-commerce activities for users

Our Competitive Strengths
 
Powerful, Unique and Integrated App. We have designed an application – the ZCITY App – which serves both consumers and merchants in ways that concurrently maximize value creation and enhance the shopping experience. Furthermore, through the application of our proprietary developed AI technology, we can offer consumers a more personalized and targeted rewards offering/experience.
 
Unique Loyalty Program. Operating under our hashtag #RewardsOnRewards, we believe our RP program increases user engagement and loyalty. Through consumer redemption and platform issuance of RP, we believe our system is advantageous to both consumers and merchants.
 
Attractive Markets. We currently operate in Malaysia, which according to the IMF is expected to average 5.1% GDP growth over the next five years. See “Business—Market Opportunity.”
 
As we scale our operations, we intend to expand to other countries in Southeast Asia, which possesses solid economic fundamentals, fast growing middle classes, favorable demographic trends and accelerating adoption of mobile technology.
 
Experienced Management Team. Our executives and directors combine decades of on-the-ground local e-commerce operations and social media marketing experience, as well as professional expertise in the global finance field.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Our main goal is focused on the recruitment of new consumers and the registration of as many Tazte merchants as possible in the most efficient way in the shortest amount of time. We believe that this approach establishes a cycle where more consumers lead to more merchants and more merchants lead to more consumers. External partnerships play an important part in our business, as we will continue sourcing more delivery partners to offer our merchants greater flexibility.
 
Consumer Growth. We strive to provide consumers with a smarter shopping experience from ordering to receiving goods and services as one seamless process. Our marketing efforts will focus on attracting consumers by awarding RP upon the execution of successful transactions (where they can redeem instant rebates).
 
Merchant Growth. We believe that our Tazte program is an example of an O2O platform focusing on transforming traditional ways of operating F&B business with digitalized smart ecosystems which better streamline merchant business operations and directly contribute to higher revenues. We feel Tazte has the potential for our ZCITY App to pioneer a generation of technologically astute “Smart Merchants”, effectively encouraging more merchants to join the technological trend. Apart from the technological advantages, merchants would be able to gain access to a significant consumer database of nearly 2 million registered users currently for their own brand marketing.

Partner Growth. We are continuously enhancing the ZCITY App through adding further strategic partnerships. We believe that collaborations will enable merchants and consumers to have more options to choose from and the delivery speed and rates related to transparency will benefit all parties.

Expansion Growth. With our proven systems and by leveraging our large network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise, we expect the ZCITY App to launch and scale our expansion plans to neighbouring countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Japan, by partnering with or acquiring local establishments.

Acquisition Growth. In order to complement our organic growth strategy, we will continue to evaluate investment and acquisition opportunities that will enable us to become market leaders. Our anticipated investments and acquisitions of other e-commerce platforms in different verticals are expected to expand our service offerings and attract new consumers and merchants. We expect negotiations with acquisition targets in the e-Commerce industries. Furthermore, we would expect to finance such acquisitions through internal and potential financings from the stock market.

Strategic Partnerships

We have entered into agreements with various Malaysian companies i.e.: TouchnGo e-wallet marketing, iPay88, Boost eWallet, Digi and GrabPay eWallet to provide essential services to our ZCITY App platform.

Strategic partnerships are vital to our strategy and operations, as they enable the ZCITY App to offer more value-added services to both our consumers and merchants. Through our partnerships, we intend to gain low-cost access to our partners’ users, where possible, to drive user conversion. Our marketing approach to acquire strategic partners focuses on the benefits of brand awareness, stressing the ability to access a larger pool of consumers and clients while reducing marketing expenses via joint marketing efforts like crossover marketing campaigns, digital marketing and affiliate programs.

Competition Outlook

We compete with other online platforms and apps for merchants, who can sell their products/services on other online shopping marketplaces and other food ordering platforms. We also compete with other e-commerce platforms and apps, fashion and lifestyle retailers and restaurants for the attention of consumers. Consumers have the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer, large marketplaces or restaurant chain. We compete for consumers and merchants based on our ability to deliver a personalized e-commerce experience with an easy-to-use mobile app, unique cross-business reward system, instant rebate & cashback, and a trusted payment gateway which is both secure and convenient.

Within the Malaysian market, we believe the principal competitors to the ZCITY App to include, but not limited to Fave, Shopback and SoPa. We have set out below how we perceive the ZCITY App differentiates its offering from these competitors in the Malaysian market both downstream (services provided to consumers) and upstream (services provided to merchants).

Intellectual Property Matters

Our technology and ZCITY App are comprised of copyrightable and/or patentable subject matter licensed by our Malaysian subsidiary, GEM. Our intellectual property assets include trade secrets associated with our software platform. We have successfully carried out development of our multilayer cloud-based software platform based upon our reliance on third parties for payment and reward points deployment. As a result, we can monetize our software by making it available in locations such as the Apple iOS Store, Google Play Store, Huawei AppGallery and compatible with existing payment systems depending on the country’s regulatory requirements. We are currently focusing on using our intellectual property in Malaysia and plan to expand further into Southeast Asia as part of our strategy. The loss of all of these third-party payment facilitators could not be easily replaced and therefore could materially affect our business and results of operations.

Trademarks. GEM has filed one trademark application stylized as “ ” with the trademark offices of Malaysia. The name and mark, ZCITY App and other trade names and service marks of ZCITY in this prospectus are our property.
