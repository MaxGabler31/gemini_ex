    Florida Pneumatic
 
 Florida Pneumatic imports and sells pneumatic hand tools, most of which are of its own design, primarily to the retail, industrial, automotive and aerospace markets. Its products include sanders, grinders, drills, saws and impact wrenches. These tools are similar in appearance and function to electric hand tools, but are powered by compressed air, rather than by electricity or battery. Air tools, as they are more commonly referred to, generally offer better performance and weigh less than their electrical counterparts. Florida Pneumatic imports approximately seventy-five types of pneumatic hand tools, most of which are sold at prices ranging from $50 to $1,000, under the names “Florida Pneumatic,” “Universal Tool”, “Jiffy Air Tool”, AIRCAT, NITROCAT, as well as under the trade names or trademarks of several private label customers. These products are sold to retailers, distributors, and private label customers through in-house sales personnel and manufacturers’ representatives. The AIRCAT and NITROCAT brands of pneumatic tools are sold primarily to the automotive service and repair market (“automotive market”). Users of Florida Pneumatics’ hand tools include industrial maintenance and production staffs, do-it-yourself mechanics, professional automobile mechanics and auto body personnel. Jiffy manufactures and distributes pneumatic tools and components primarily to aerospace manufacturers.
 
Florida Pneumatic also markets, through its Berkley Tool division (“Berkley”), a product line that includes pipe and bolt dies, pipe taps, wrenches, vises and stands, pipe and tubing cutting equipment, hydrostatic test pumps, and replacement electrical components for a widely-used brand of pipe cutting and threading machines. Florida Pneumatic markets Berkley’s products through industrial distributors and contractors. Florida Pneumatic also assembles and markets a line of compressor air filters.
 
There are redundant supply sources for nearly all products purchased.
 
The primary competitive factors in the industrial and automotive pneumatic tool market are quality, breadth and availability of products, customer service, technical support, price and brand name awareness. The primary competitive factors in the retail pneumatic tool market are price, service and brand-name awareness. The primary competitive factors in the aerospace market are quality, technology and service levels. Florida Pneumatics’ are sold directly to the retailers, direct to customers and through distributors. Currently, there is minimal seasonality to Florida Pneumatics’ revenue.
 
Jiffy manufactures its own products in the United States. During 2018, Florida Pneumatic purchased approximately 35% of its pneumatic tools from China, 64% from Taiwan and 1% from Japan and Europe.  Florida Pneumatic performs final assembly on certain of its products at its factory in Jupiter, Florida.
 
Hy-Tech
 
Hy-Tech designs, manufactures and distributes industrial tools, systems, gearing, accessories and a wide variety of replacement parts under the brands ATP, Numatx, Thaxton, OZAT and Quality Gear.  Hy-Tech produces and sells heavy-duty pneumatic impact tools, grinders, air motors, hydro-pneumatic riveters, hydrostatic test plugs, impact sockets and custom gears, with prices ranging from $300 to $42,000.
 
Hy-Tech’s ”Engineered Solutions” products are sold direct to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM’s), and industrial branded products are sold through a broad network of specialized industrial distributors serving power generation, petrochemical, aerospace, construction, railroad, mining, ship building and fabricated metals. Hy-Tech works directly with their industrial customers, designing and manufacturing products from finished components to complete turnkey systems to be sold under their own brand names.
