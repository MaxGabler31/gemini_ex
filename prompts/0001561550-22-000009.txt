Item 1. Business
Overview
Datadog is the monitoring and security platform for cloud applications.
Our SaaS platform integrates and automates infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring and log management to provide unified, real-time observability of our customers’ entire technology stack. Datadog is used by organizations of all sizes and across a wide range of industries to enable digital transformation and cloud migration, drive collaboration among development, operations, security and business teams, accelerate time to market for applications, reduce time to problem resolution, secure applications and infrastructure, understand user behavior and track key business metrics.
Software applications are transforming how organizations engage with customers and operate their businesses. Companies across all industries are re-platforming their businesses to cloud infrastructures to enable this digital transformation. Historically, engineering teams have been siloed, making the development of next generation applications in dynamic cloud environments challenging. We started Datadog to break this model and facilitate collaboration among development and operations teams, enabling the adoption of DevOps practices. Since then we have continuously pushed to unify separate tools into an integrated monitoring and analytics platform, readily available to everyone who cares about applications and their impact on business. We continue to broaden our observability platform. Starting in 2020, we began our efforts in cloud security, and in 2021 expanded into developer use cases.
From our founding goal of breaking down silos between Dev and Ops, we set out in 2010 to build a real-time data integration platform to turn chaos from disparate sources into digestible and actionable insights. In 2012, we launched our first use case with infrastructure monitoring, purpose-built to handle increasingly ephemeral cloud-native architectures. This enabled us to be deployed on our customers’ entire cloud IT environments and gave our product broad usage across Dev, Ops and business teams, in turn allowing us to address a bigger set of challenges through our platform. In 2017 we launched our Application Performance Monitoring, or APM, product, designed to be broadly deployed in very distributed, micro-services architectures. In 2018, we were the first to combine the “three pillars of observability” with the introduction of our Log Management product. To allow for full-stack observability, in 2019, we launched user Experience Monitoring and Network Performance Monitoring. In 2020, we extended into security with the launch of Security Monitoring to detect threats in real time, as well as launched Continuous Profiler and Incident Management to enhance workflows and collaboration as incidents occur. In 2021, we launched our Cloud Security Platform, including the launches of Cloud Security Posture Management and Cloud Workload Security. We also launched CI Visibility to bring production-level observability to developers. And we launched Network Device Monitoring for physical network devices, and Database Monitoring to improve database performance. Today, we offer end-to-end monitoring and analytics, powered by a common data model that is extensible for use cases in observability, cloud security, and developer observability.
Our proprietary platform combines the power of metrics, traces, logs, and other data from over 500 integrations to provide a unified view of infrastructure, application performance and the real-time events impacting this performance. Datadog is designed to be cloud agnostic and easy to deploy, with hundreds of out-of-the-box integrations, a built-in understanding of modern technology stacks and extensive customizations. Customers can deploy our platform across their entire infrastructure, making it ubiquitous and a daily part of the lives of developers, operations engineers and business leaders.
We believe that our platform currently addresses a significant portion of the IT Operations Management market. According to Gartner, the IT Operations Management market represents a $53 billion opportunity in 2025. We believe a large portion of this spend is for legacy on-premise and private cloud environments but does not fully include the opportunity in modern multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments. Our platform is designed to address both legacy and modern environments.
We employ a land-and-expand business model centered around offering products that are easy to adopt and have a very short time to value. Our customers can expand their footprint with us on a self-service basis. Our customers often significantly increase their usage of the products they initially buy from us and expand their usage to other products we offer on our platform. We grow with our customers as they expand their workloads in the public and private cloud.  
Our Solution and Key Strengths
Datadog was founded on the premise that the old model of siloed developers and IT operations engineers is broken, and that legacy tools used for monitoring static on-premise architectures do not work in modern cloud or hybrid 
environments. Datadog’s cloud-native platform enables development and operations teams to collaborate, quickly build and improve applications, and drive business performance. Empowered by our out-of-the box functionality and simple, self-service installation, our customers are able to rapidly deploy our platform to provide application- and infrastructure-wide visibility, often within minutes.
•Built for dynamic cloud infrastructures. Our innovative platform was born in the cloud and was built to work with ephemeral cloud technologies such as microservices, containers and serverless computing. Our data model was built to work at cloud scale with highly dynamic data sets and processes more than 10 trillion events a day.
•Simple but not simplistic. Our platform is easy-to-use with out-of-the-box integrations, customizable drag-and-drop dashboards, real-time visualization and prioritized alerting. The platform is deployed in a self-service installation process within minutes, allowing new users to quickly derive value without any specialized training or heavy implementation or customization. It is highly extensible across a wide array of use cases to a broad set of developers, operations engineers, security professionals, product managers, product designers, support staff, and business users. As a result, our platform is integral to business operations and used every day, and our users find increasing value in the solution over time.
•Integrated data platform. We were the first to combine the “three pillars of observability” - metrics, traces, and logs - with the introduction of our log management solution in 2018. Today, our platform combines infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, log management, user experience monitoring, network performance monitoring, database monitoring, security monitoring, incident management, and developer testing and pipeline monitoring in one integrated data platform. This approach increases efficiency by reducing both the expense and friction of attempting to glean insights from disparate systems. We are able to provide a unified view across the IT stack, including infrastructure and application performance, as well as the real-time events impacting performance. Each of our products is integrated and taken together, they provide the ability to view metrics, traces, logs, and other data side-by-side and to perform correlation analysis.
•Built for collaboration. Our platform was built to break down the silos between developers and operations teams in order to help organizations adopt DevOps practices and improve overall business performance. We provide development and operations teams with a common set of tools to develop a joint understanding of application performance and shared insights into the infrastructure supporting the applications. Additionally, our customizable and interactive dashboards can be shared with business teams to provide them with real-time actionable insights. Over time, as the use cases for our platform have expanded, the types of users that we can serve and help to collaborate have expanded as well, to include security professionals, support staff, and business users.
•Cloud agnostic. Our platform is designed to be deployable across all environments, including public cloud, private cloud, on-premise and multi-cloud hybrid environments, allowing organizations to diversify their infrastructure and reduce single vendor dependence.
•Ubiquitous. Datadog is frequently deployed across a customer’s entire infrastructure, making it ubiquitous. Compared to legacy systems that are often used only by a few users in an organization’s IT operations team, Datadog is a daily part of the lives of developers, operations engineers and business leaders.
•Integrates with our customers’ complex environments. We enable development and operations teams to harness the full spectrum of SaaS and open source tools. We have over 500 out-of-the-box integrations with technologies to provide significant value to our customers without the need for professional services. Our integrations provide for comprehensive data point aggregation and consistent, up-to-date, high-quality customer experiences across heterogeneous IT environments as they are fully maintained by Datadog.
•Powered by robust analytics and machine-learning. Our platform ingests massive amounts of data into our unified data warehouse. We develop actionable insights using our advanced analytics capabilities. Our platform's Watchdog capabilities feature artificial intelligence and machine learning that can cross-correlate metrics, traces, logs, and other data to identify outliers and notify users of potential anomalies before they impact the business.
•Scalable. Our SaaS platform is highly scalable and is delivered through the cloud. Our platform is massively scalable, currently monitoring more than tens of trillion events a day and millions of servers and containers at any point in time. We offer secure, easily accessible data retention at full granularity for extensive periods of time, which can provide customers with a complete view of their historical data.

•Automated Alerts. We offer sophisticated real time alerting capabilities in the platform that detects issues, alerts users, and integrates with their service management systems.
Our platform consists of the following products that can be used individually or as a unified solution and includes a Marketplace where customers can access products built by our partners on top of the Datadog platform. Our products include:
•Infrastructure Monitoring. Our Infrastructure Monitoring platform provides real-time monitoring of IT infrastructure across public cloud, private cloud and hybrid environments, as well as in containers and serverless architectures, ensuring performance and availability of applications. All infrastructure data is located in one repository with automatic correlation, regardless of environment size or rate of change, to provide a fulsome view of everything that is occurring across the IT ecosystem.
•Application Performance Monitoring (APM). APM provides full visibility into the health and functioning of applications regardless of the deployment environment. Distributed tracing across microservices, hosts, 
containers and serverless computing functions allows our customers to gain deep insights into application performance.
•Log Management. Log Management for applications, systems and cloud platforms ingests data, creates indexes and enables querying of logs with visualizations and alerting to provide immediate insight into any performance issues. Logging Without Limits™ decouples the cost of log ingestion from processing, allowing customers to cost effectively collect a massive volume of logs and selectively process those they need to monitor.
•User Experience Monitoring. User experience monitoring brings visibility up the stack to monitor the digital experience of the customer and is comprised of two products – Synthetics and Real User Monitoring, or RUM. Synthetics provides user-experience monitoring of applications and API endpoints via simulated AI-powered user requests to track application performance and ensure uptime. RUM provides analysis and visualization of the performance of front-end applications as experienced by all actual users. 
•Continuous Profiler. Continuous Profiler measures code level performance in any environment through an always-on, and low overhead solution. This allows customers to quickly identify and optimize the most resource-consuming parts in application code in order to improve mean time to resolution, enhance user experience and reduce cloud provider cost.
•Database Monitoring. Database Monitoring allows customers to view query metrics and explain plans from all of their databases in a single place. With Database Monitoring, they can quickly pinpoint costly and slow queries and drill into precise execution details to address bottlenecks. Additionally, query and host metric correlation makes it easy to identify and understand the impact of resource constraints on database performance.
•Network Monitoring. Network Monitoring enables the analysis and visualization of the flow of network traffic in cloud-based or hybrid environments. It is very lightweight, allowing customers to monitor the flow of network traffic without sacrificing performance. With the launch of Network Device Monitoring in 2021, our Network Monitoring solution also offers monitoring of network hardware, such as routers, switches, and firewalls. Network Monitoring allows the mapping of full-stack dependencies, and is fully integrated with the Datadog platform.
•Cloud SIEM. Cloud SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) allows customers to detect threats in real time and investigate security signals across metrics, traces, logs, and other data. It provides the full engineering organization, including Dev, Ops, and security teams, visibility into common data sources, in order to better operationalize IT security. 
•Cloud Security Posture Management. Cloud Security Posture Management allows customers to assess and visualize the current and historic security posture of their cloud environments, automate audit evidence collection, and catch misconfigurations that leaves their organizations vulnerable to attacks.
•Cloud Workload Security. Cloud Workload Security performs deep, in-kernel analysis of workload activity across customers' hosts and containers to uncover threats. Datadog researches, develops, and packages out-of-the-box threat detection, with the ability to customize security rules.
•Incident Management. Incident management allows users to declare incidents, investigate root cause and dependencies, collaborate around a shared view of the incident, follow to resolution, and auto-generate post-mortem documentations, all within the Datadog platform.
•CI Visibility. CI, or Continuous Integration, Visibility provides deep insight into the health and performance of customers' CI environment. Datadog auto-instruments pipelines and tests, so customers can dive into traces for problematic builds and executions. They can also scope CI data by repository, branch, or commit in order to surface trends and troubleshoot issues. This provides a comprehensive view into CI activity and makes it easier to resolve bottlenecks, reduce CI costs, and deliver better software.
