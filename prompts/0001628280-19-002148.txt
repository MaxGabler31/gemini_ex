Item 1.        Business
Our Company
We are the largest integrated owner/operator of company-branded hotels in North America. Our business operates in the extended-stay segment of the lodging industry, and as of December 31, 2018, we owned and operated 554 hotel properties in 40 U.S. states, consisting of approximately 61,500 rooms, and franchised or managed 73 hotel properties for third parties, consisting of approximately 7,500 rooms. All 627 system-wide hotels operate under the Extended Stay America brand, which serves the mid-price extended stay segment and accounts for approximately 40% of the segment by number of rooms in the United States. 
Extended Stay America-branded hotels are designed to provide an affordable and attractive alternative to traditional lodging or apartment accommodations and are targeted toward self-sufficient, value-conscious guests who need lodging for more than a week. Guests include business travelers, leisure travelers, professionals on temporary work or training assignments, persons relocating, the temporarily displaced, those purchasing a home and anyone else in need of temporary housing. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had total revenues of $1.3 billion, net income of $211.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $599.7 million. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 37.0%, 21.1% and 41.9% of our owned hotel room revenues were derived from guests with stays from 1-6 nights, from 7-29 nights, and for 30 or more nights, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 29.2% of our owned hotel room revenues were derived from property-direct reservations, 24.5% were derived from our central call center, 17.8% were derived from our own proprietary website, 24.3% were derived from third party intermediaries and 4.2% were derived from travel agencies using global distribution systems.
We seek to drive our competitive advantage by targeting our product offering to an underserved market segment and by driving economies of scale through our national distribution and concentration of multiple hotels in individual markets. We focus on continually improving our product and service, improving marketing efforts and driving ADR. In addition to owning and operating hotels, we have increased, and plan to continue to increase, our distribution through the ongoing development of our fee-based income stream pursuant to which we franchise our brand to third parties and, in some instances, manage hotels on behalf of our franchisees. We also seek to increase our efficiency and the overall quality of our real estate portfolio by selling non-strategic hotels over time, in some cases franchising our brand to, or managing sold hotels for, the buyers. Our current and future plans include some or all of the following:

• | continuing to invest capital in our hotels, both on an ongoing basis and through future cyclical hotel renovation programs, where justified by anticipated returns on investment;


• | repurposing and/or rebuilding certain of our hotel properties;


• | building new Extended Stay America hotel properties which we expect to own and operate;


• | selling non-strategic hotels to buyers that we expect will franchise the Extended Stay America brand from us and for whom we may perform management or other services;


• | converting existing hotels to the Extended Stay America brand, either as franchises or on our own balance sheet;


• | franchising the Extended Stay America brand to newly-constructed hotel properties built and owned by third parties for whom we may perform management or other services; and


• | acquiring additional hotel properties.

Our History
We were founded in 1995 as a developer, owner and operator of extended stay hotels. Following a period focused primarily on new development, we became a consolidator of hotel properties by selectively acquiring extended stay companies and hotels, ultimately creating the largest mid-price extended stay company in the United States. We were acquired out of bankruptcy in October 2010. In November 2013, we completed an initial public offering and restructured and reorganized our then-existing business. 
Ownership of Paired Shares gives investors an ownership interest in our hotel properties through ESH REIT and in our franchising and hotel management business, including the operation of our owned hotels, and other aspects of our business through the Corporation. This structure permits us to enjoy some, though not all, of the benefits of a REIT (i.e., while ESH REIT is taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, all distributions paid by ESH REIT to the Corporation are subject to corporate level tax, effectively eliminating approximately 57% of the tax benefit of REIT status for the consolidated enterprise).
We currently operate an extended stay hospitality platform with approximately 8,100 employees and are led by a management team with public company experience in hospitality, consumer retail and service businesses.
The Corporation
Extended Stay America, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on July 8, 2013. As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation leased and operated 554 hotels, consisting of approximately 61,500 rooms, and franchised and/or managed 73 hotels for third parties, consisting of approximately 7,500 rooms. The 554 hotels, which are owned by ESH REIT, are leased to and operated by the Operating Lessees, wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation, and are managed by ESA Management, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, pursuant to management agreements. All hotels operate under the Extended Stay America brand. ESH Strategies, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, owns the brand and intellectual property related to our business and licenses them to its subsidiary, ESH Strategies Franchise, which in-turn relicenses it to third-party franchisees.
ESH REIT
ESH Hospitality, Inc. was formed as a limited liability company in Delaware on September 16, 2010 and was converted to a corporation on November 5, 2013. ESH REIT owns 554 hotel properties, which are leased to and operated by subsidiaries of the Corporation as described in the preceding paragraph. ESH REIT has elected to be taxed as a REIT.
Our Brand
We currently operate all of our hotels under the Extended Stay America brand. All Extended Stay America-branded hotels feature in-room kitchens, free WiFi, free grab-and-go breakfast, flat screen TVs with premium cable channels and on-site guest laundry. We continue to own the intellectual property rights in certain of our former brands, including Homestead Studio Suites, Studio Plus and Extended Stay Deluxe.

Our Corporate Structure
The following chart summarizes our corporate structure as of December 31, 2018.

Our Industry
U.S. Lodging Industry
The lodging industry is a significant part of the U.S. economy, generating over $163.3 billion of room revenues in 2018 and comprising approximately 5.2 million hotel rooms as of December 31, 2018, according to STR, Inc. (“STR”)(1). Lodging industry performance is generally tied to both macro-economic and micro-economic trends in the United States and, similar to other industries, experiences both positive and negative operating cycles. Following the 2008 to 2009 recession, demand in the U.S. lodging industry has experienced a nine-year growth cycle in which demand growth has exceeded supply growth, even as supply growth has returned to long-term average rates. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”)(2), room supply grew 2.0% in 2018 and is expected to grow 2.1% in 2019, in line with historical rates of annual supply growth. RevPAR has grown in the U.S. lodging industry each year starting in 2010. According to PwC, RevPAR for the overall U.S. lodging industry grew 2.9% in 2018, and is expected to grow 2.3% in 2019.
U.S. Extended Stay Segment
Extended stay hotels represent a growing segment within the U.S. lodging industry, with approximately 467,200 rooms for the year ended December 31, 2018, according to The Highland Group(3). The extended stay segment tends to follow the cyclicality of the overall lodging industry. Extended stay hotels are differentiated by price point into economy, mid-price and upscale segments. Our business is focused on the mid-price extended stay segment, which accounted for approximately 33% of the supply of extended stay rooms in 2018, approximately 40% of which are branded Extended Stay America.
Seasonality
The lodging industry is seasonal in nature. The Company’s revenues are generally lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year as is typical in the U.S. lodging industry. Because many of the Company’s hotel operating and general and administrative expenses are fixed and do not fluctuate with changes in revenues, declines in revenues can cause disproportionate fluctuations or decreases in the Company’s quarterly earnings and operating cash flows during these periods.
ESH REIT’s revenues and earnings are generally highest during the fourth quarter of each calendar year as rental revenues contingent upon lessee hotel revenues are not earned for accounting purposes until certain lessee hotel revenue thresholds are achieved, which typically occurs in the fourth quarter. ESH REIT’s cash flows generally remain consistent each quarter of the calendar year, except as noted above.
Cyclicality
The lodging industry is cyclical and its fundamental performance tends to follow the general economy, albeit on a lagged basis. There is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms, occupancy levels and rates realized by owners and operators of hotel properties through economic cycles. Variability of results through some economic cycles in the past has been more severe due to changes in the supply of hotel rooms in given markets or in given categories of hotels. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results of operations for owners, operators and/or franchisors of hotel properties. The costs of running a hotel, and in particular an extended stay hotel, tend to be more fixed than variable. Because of this, in an environment of either increasing or decreasing revenues, the rate of change in earnings will likely be greater than the rate of change in revenues. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Lodging Industry—The lodging industry, including the extended stay segment, is cyclical and a worsening of general economic conditions or low levels of economic growth could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders.”

Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry, with sources of competition including other extended stay hotel brands, transient-oriented hotel brands that compete for both transient and extended stay guests, serviced apartments and private homes and rooms and apartments rented on the internet. In addition, we face competition for both quality acquisition opportunities and locations to build new hotels and for hotel owners and developers as potential franchisees. We also face competition from third-party intermediaries and, increasingly, from new channels of distribution, such as large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model and search engines. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Lodging Industry—We operate in a highly competitive industry.”
Employees
We employ approximately 8,100 employees. Approximately 7,700 of these employees are hotel property-level employees, comprised of approximately 4,100 full-time employees and approximately 3,600 part-time employees. None of our employees are currently represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
Sales, Marketing and Reservations
Our sales team is focused on growing the value of our existing accounts, developing business from new customers and partnering with our operations team to drive local sales. We are organized regionally and by account, and our team focuses on the following customers with extended stay lodging needs: major Fortune 500 companies; small and medium sized businesses; travel agencies; relocation and staffing consultants; and medical, technology, government and educational organizations. Approximately 40.0% of our total revenues in 2018 were derived from accounts managed by this team. In 2018, we launched a new business travel program comprised of products and services designed to help business travel buyers manage their companies’ travel-related objectives.
We seek to maximize revenue in each hotel through our revenue management team. This team is responsible for determining prices and managing the availability of room inventory to different channels and customer segments. Our automated revenue management system allows us to automatically price against demand from short-term and long-term guests. 
Our marketing strategy is focused on growing awareness of the Extended Stay America brand and demand for our hotels through a combination of media channels, including print, public relations and email marketing. We also put a significant emphasis on digital marketing, buying search engine placement, internet display advertising and other media to drive traffic to our website, mobile app and call center. We maintain a customer database and use it for targeted marketing activity. Our customer loyalty program, called Extended Perks, had more than 2.7 million members as of December 31, 2018. The program is built around the idea of “instant rewards – no points required,” with members receiving discount offers on our rooms, as well as discounts from our merchandise and service partners. We believe this program has helped, and will continue to help, us generate repeat business and market directly to more of our customers.
We use a central reservation system to provide access to our hotel inventory through a wide variety of channels, including property-direct, our central call center, our desktop and mobile websites, travel agency global distribution systems and third-party intermediaries. We outsource our central reservation system, call center and management of our website. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 29.2% of our owned hotel room revenues were derived from property-direct reservations, 24.5% were derived from our central call center, 17.8% were derived from our own proprietary website, 24.3% were derived from third party intermediaries and 4.2% were derived from travel agencies using global distribution systems. We believe we have an opportunity to increase the power and reach of our distribution network through enhanced partnerships with additional agency, merchant and wholesale partners.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Our hotel properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws that impose liability for contamination. Under these laws, governmental entities have the authority to require us, as the current or former owner of a property, to perform or pay for the clean-up of contamination (including hazardous substances, waste or petroleum products) at or emanating from the property and to pay for natural resource damage arising from contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination. Such liability can be joint and several, so that each covered person can be responsible for all of the costs involved, even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination. We can also be liable to private parties for costs of remediation, personal injury and death and/or property damage resulting from contamination at or emanating from our owned hotel properties. Moreover, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owner’s ability to borrow funds using the 
5

property as collateral or to sell the property on favorable terms or at all. Furthermore, persons who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, may be liable for costs associated with cleanup of that facility. 
Phase I environmental assessments were most recently obtained for substantially all of our owned hotel properties in 2012 and for all hotel properties that we have purchased since that time. The Phase I environmental assessments were intended to identify potential contamination, but did not include any invasive sampling procedures, such as soil or ground water sampling. The Phase I environmental assessments identified a number of known or potential environmental conditions associated with historic uses of the hotel properties or adjacent properties. However, the Phase I environmental assessments did not identify any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, results of operations or liquidity. It is possible that these environmental assessments did not reveal all potential environmental liabilities, such as the presence of former underground tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, that could create a potential for release of hazardous substances. In addition, it is possible that environmental liabilities have arisen since the assessments were completed. No assurances can be given that (i) future regulatory requirements will not impose any material environmental liability, or (ii) the current environmental condition of our hotel properties will not be affected by the condition of properties in the vicinity of our hotel properties (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to us.
In addition, our hotels (including our real property, operations and equipment) are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulatory requirements that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, the use, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, air emissions, discharges of waste materials (such as refuge or sewage), the registration, maintenance and operation of our boilers and storage tanks, asbestos and lead-based paint. Some of our hotels also routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations, which are subject to regulation (for example, swimming pool chemicals or biological waste). Our hotels incur costs to comply with these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and if these regulatory requirements are not met or become more stringent in the future, or unforeseen events result in the discharge of dangerous or toxic substances at our hotel properties, we could be subject to materially increased costs of compliance, fines and penalties for non-compliance, and material liability from third parties for harm to the environment, damage to real property or personal injury and death. We are aware of no past or present environmental liability for non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.
Certain hotels we own or those we may acquire in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained asbestos-contaminating material (“ACM”). Environmental, health and safety laws require that ACM be properly managed and maintained, and include requirements to undertake special precautions, such as removal or abatement if ACM would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building. These laws regarding ACM may impose fines and penalties on building owners, employers and operators for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third-party liability. We are not presently aware of ACM at our hotel properties that would result in a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.
In addition, when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold at any of our owned hotel properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property. In addition, the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from our guests, employees and others if or when property damage or health concerns arise. We are not presently aware of any indoor air quality issues at our owned hotel properties that would result in a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.
We have obtained environmental insurance subject to limits, deductibles and exclusions customarily carried for similar businesses. We believe that our environmental insurance policy is appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, our environmental insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover our losses. Although our franchise and management agreements include broad indemnity provisions that encompass environmental claims resulting from franchised or managed properties, there can be no assurance that the indemnifying counterparties would be solvent or otherwise able to indemnify us if we were found liable for those claims.
Intellectual Property
In the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and other proprietary rights are very important to the success of our business. The Corporation has a significant number of 
6

trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, other proprietary rights and pending registrations and expends significant resources on their surveillance, registration and protection.
Regulation
A number of states and local governments regulate the licensing of hotels by requiring registration, disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct. We believe that each of our owned hotels has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its respective business and we intend to continue to obtain these permits and approvals for any new hotels. We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with our employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, meal and rest periods, working conditions and work permit requirements. An increase in the minimum wage rate, employee benefit costs or other costs associated with employees could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations. There are frequently proposals under consideration at the federal, state and local levels to increase the minimum wage and to expand overtime pay and benefits requirements.
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. We attempt to satisfy ADA requirements in the designs for and operation of our hotels, websites and other facilities subject to the ADA, but we cannot assure you that we will not be subjected to a material ADA claim. If that were to happen, we could be ordered to spend substantial sums to achieve compliance, fines could be imposed against us and we could be required to pay damage awards to private litigants. The ADA and other regulatory initiatives could materially adversely affect our business as well as the lodging industry in general.
The Federal Trade Commission and numerous states regulate the sale and termination of franchises and business opportunities. These regulations generally impose registration and filing requirements and in some cases control specific terms of franchise agreements. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in franchisees having the right to rescind their franchise agreements as well as fines, penalties and injunctive relief imposed by regulating authorities.
Insurance
We currently have the types and amounts of insurance coverage that we consider appropriate for a company in our business. While we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we were held liable for amounts exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage or for claims outside the scope of our insurance coverage.
