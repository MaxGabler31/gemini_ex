GENERAL
Background
Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. (referred to, with its consolidated subsidiaries, as "we," "us," "our," the "Company," "SWM INTL" or "SWM" unless the context indicates otherwise) is a leading global performance materials company, focused on bringing best-in-class innovation, design, and manufacturing solutions to our customers. Our highly engineered films, adhesive tapes, foams, nets, nonwovens, and papers are designed and manufactured using resins, polymers, and natural fibers for a variety of industries and specialty applications. The Company, headquartered in the United States of America (the "U.S."), operates under two reportable segments: Advanced Materials & Structures ("AMS"), which manufactures resin-based products used in specialty applications in the healthcare, construction, industrial, transportation and filtration end-markets, and Engineered Papers ("EP"), which produces traditional papers and other engineered fiber-based materials primarily for the tobacco industry.
The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1995 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark Corporation ("Kimberly-Clark"). On November 30, 1995, Kimberly-Clark transferred its tobacco-related paper and other paper products businesses conducted in the U.S., France and Canada to the Company and distributed all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company to its stockholders (the "spin-off"). As a result, the Company became an independent public company. SWM and its subsidiaries manufacture on four continents, conduct business in over 90 countries and operates 38 production locations worldwide, with facilities in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Brazil, China, Italy, Malaysia, India and Poland.
Our principal executive office is located at 100 North Point Center East, Suite 600, Alpharetta, Georgia 30022-8246 and our telephone number is (800) 514-0186. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "SWM."
Strategic Overview
Through 2013, the Company operated as a tobacco-centric paper operation. In late 2012, SWM's management and Board of Directors elected to pursue a strategic transformation by increasing profit streams in growth-oriented end-markets through acquisitions, while carefully managing the profitable but mature tobacco operations. Over time, this strategy was intended to reposition SWM as a more diversified and growth-oriented enterprise while maintaining its company-wide focus on several underlying themes: manufacturing and innovation expertise in performance materials, operational excellence, and customer intimacy. The Company selectively targeted acquisition candidates that served diversified and growing end-markets, generated profitability associated with premium differentiated products, and had leading and defensible competitive positions in their core product categories. In addition, management believed many acquisition targets would have unique synergy opportunities 
when combined with the assets and capabilities of SWM, such as SWM’s broad portfolio of manufacturing technologies and solutions, a global infrastructure, and a robust operational excellence program. 
Pursuant to this strategy, management has used free cash flow and debt-financing to support growth investments. From 2013 to 2021 the Company acquired five primary businesses, DelStar, Inc. ("DelStar"), Argotec Intermediate Holdings LLC ("Argotec"), Conwed Plastics LLC (“Conwed”), Tekra, LLC and Trient ("Tekra"), and Scapa Group plc ("Scapa"). These businesses together now comprise the AMS segment, which generated approximately $1 billion of annualized net sales in 2021. As a result of these strategic actions to grow and diversify the business, non-tobacco sales represented approximately 70% of consolidated net sales. The EP segment continues to generate significant cash flow, supporting SWM’s growth investments, debt reduction, and dividends to shareholders.
The AMS Growth Platform - The acquisitions described below (as well as two smaller “bolt-on” acquisitions) comprise the AMS segment. The Company believes that AMS has reached the scale required to position SWM for sustainable long-term sales and profit growth across a broad set of attractive end-markets.
In December 2013, the Company acquired DelStar, a manufacturer of resin-based nets, films and non-wovens, focused on the filtration, healthcare, and industrial end-markets. DelStar established SWM's presence in new industries and added a portfolio of high-value technologies. 
In October 2015, the Company acquired Argotec, a manufacturer of urethane films for applications primarily in the transportation end-market. A key growth driver was increasing demand for surface protection films used for automotive paint protection and glass lamination. This business also serves customers in the healthcare and industrial end-markets. From a technology standpoint, Argotec added to SWM's growing resin extrusion capabilities.
In January 2017, SWM acquired Conwed, a producer of resin-based netting. Conwed’s similarities to the Company’s existing netting production assets presented a compelling opportunity to drive footprint rationalization synergies. Conwed added further end-market diversification, serving the construction, filtration and industrial end-markets. 
On March 13, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Tekra, a converter of high-performance films and substrates which added coating and converting capabilities, increased the Company’s healthcare business, and provided further penetration into transportation and industrial end-markets.
On April 15, 2021, SWM completed its acquisition of Scapa, a U.K,-based innovation, design, and manufacturing solutions provider for healthcare and industrial markets. The acquisition added to SWM’s portfolio of precision engineered performance materials, expanded the Company’s innovation, design, and formulation capabilities, and brought a variety of new coating, adhesive, and converting technologies to SWM. Scapa, part of the AMS segment, operates globally with manufacturing and sales operations in the Americas, Asia and Europe.
Engineered Papers Profit Stability and Innovation – The Company remains committed to serving its tobacco customers, supplying industry leading products and service. Despite the mature nature of the industry and expectation for continued market attrition, the Company believes it can deliver profit stability, and potentially growth, through a continued focus on high-value products, cost and efficiency improvements, innovation, and diversification.
Our EP segment is generally a recession resistant business that continues to contribute significant cash flows. We supply the major, and many of the smaller, cigarette and cigar manufacturers around the world, with a focus on specialized products. Beyond our legacy products, the Company has invested in innovation and new manufacturing techniques to support our customers’ new product introductions. Our reconstituted fiber technologies have been used to develop materials for reduced-risk products and hemp-based fiber products given emerging demand for alternative, non-tobacco applications. Given our extensive technical expertise, long-standing relationships, and industry reputation, SWM is uniquely positioned to be an innovation and development partner to both large and 
small customers across these new product categories and alternative solutions as marketplace interest increases. EP is also increasing its manufacturing and commercial focus on more environmentally friendly solutions and other new products across our end-markets, with several of these initiatives being collaborations between the EP and AMS segments (including Scapa).

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Segment Financial Information. We operate and manage two reportable segments based on our product lines: AMS and EP. The AMS segment manufactures resin-based products used in specialty applications in the healthcare, construction, industrial, transportation and filtration end-markets. This segment is comprised of the businesses we acquired from 2013 to 2021: DelStar, Argotec, Conwed, Tekra and Scapa, which the Company has integrated into a more holistically aligned operating segment. Our EP segment produces papers and other materials primarily for the tobacco industry. 
Additional information regarding "Segment Performance" is included in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, selected financial data for our segments is available in Note 21. Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and a discussion regarding the risks associated with foreign operations is available in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors". 
Financial information about foreign and domestic operations, contained under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" appearing in Part II, Item 7 herein and in Notes 13, 14, 17 and 21 ("Restructuring and Impairment Activities," "Debt," "Income Taxes" and "Segment Information," respectively) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in Part II, Item 8 herein, is incorporated by reference in this Item 1.
Advanced Materials & Structures
Products. We manufacture and sell a variety of highly engineered resin-based nets, films, adhesive tapes, foams, and other non-wovens. These performance materials are often used in growing applications serving the healthcare, construction, industrial, transportation and filtration end-markets. Our most prevalent production technologies are extrusion-based, meaning resin pellets are heated, softened, and forced through a metal die to form continuous sheets or strands. We have significant technological expertise in proprietary die construction, which our competitors often outsource, and we consider this an advantage in protecting our technology and competitive position. We also have significant expertise (through the Tekra and Scapa acquisitions) in formulations, coatings, adhesives, and converting technologies. These capabilities often complement our extruded products and enhance SWM’s value proposition as a full solutions provider. 
Our thermoplastic nets are used in a variety of applications, the most prominent of which is their use as spacer netting in reverse osmosis water filtration (“RO filtration") devices. We have established a strong presence in this application by customizing products to meet demanding customer specifications, such as thickness/weight, flow characteristics, and heat and pressure resistance. Our nets are also used in a variety of other filtration applications such as fuel and hydraulic fluid filters, pharmaceutical filters, and food and beverage filters. Another key netting application is erosion control. Our nets are the outside layers in erosion control blankets, which are used to prevent soil run-off on exposed and sloped terrain. Our nets can also be found in a variety of industrial applications such as the production of wind turbine blades and food packaging.
We manufacture our thermoplastic polyurethane films ("TPU") to have combinations of the following attributes: UV and scratch resistance, durability, and ultra-clarity. The ability to demonstrate these rare combinations make them ideally suited for demanding transportation-related surface protection applications, primarily automotive paint protection and security reinforced glass. These products are also used in certain niche applications in the industrial and healthcare end-markets. Other films, including apertured film products, are used in wound care applications, such as finger bandages and wound dressings for the healthcare end-market and are also used in specialty liquid filters for ultra-pure semiconductor manufacturing processes. 
The acquisition of Tekra added coating and converting capabilities which are often used in production of films or other substrates. The acquisition of Scapa added significant additional capabilities in coatings and adhesives. These technologies are used in production of specialty tapes used in wire wraps for undersea cables and in automotive production, for example, in industrial and transportation end-markets. Scapa also leverages its coatings and adhesive 
technologies in the healthcare end-market, as a leading developer and producer of skin-friendly solutions such as advanced woundcare, medical device monitors, and personal care products. 
Our non-wovens are typically air-laid resin-based materials often used in liquid filtration and residential and commercial air filtration. In addition to rolled goods, SWM also manufactures rigid core tubing, an extruded resin product that also is primarily used in reverse osmosis water filtration devices, and flexible tubing used in various medical and industrial applications.
With the growth of our AMS division, our technical expertise around the production, coating, and converting of resin-based materials is increasing. We believe we have industry-leading innovation capabilities and an expanding product portfolio which we expect to support growth through collaborative product development opportunities with our customers.
Markets and Customers. The AMS segment supplies customers serving the healthcare, construction, industrial, transportation and filtration end-markets. Generally, the applications and customers the AMS segment serves are in growing end-markets, and as a percentage of total AMS segment sales in 2021 were as follows: healthcare - 24%, construction - 20%, industrial - 20%, transportation - 18%, and filtration - 18%. These products are highly engineered and often customized. In some cases, we are the sole supplier of certain products to our top customers, though no customer represents more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. 
Within the filtration end-market, reverse osmosis water filtration has exhibited historical long-term growth due to increasing global demand for drinkable water and we expect global infrastructure investments in this area to continue long-term. Our other filtration products are often used in the food and beverage industries and heavy equipment and machinery used in the oil and gas industries, often filtering fuel and hydraulic liquids. We refer to non-RO liquid filtration products generally as process filtration. We expect strong long-term demand across the product line. In addition to liquid filtration products, the company also produces media and support materials for air filtration devices used in commercial and residential HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), which also stands to benefit from favorable long-term demand for cleaner air.
The majority of our TPU films are used in transportation-related surface protection applications, specifically automotive paint protection. This product is typically sold and installed in the after-market through dealerships or auto body shops. Recently, we have benefited from global adoption of paint protection films, particularly in Asia. Other surface protection applications include ballistic-resistant and security glass used in various transportation modes (auto/aero/train) and our films can also be used in emerging “smartglass” products. 
Our healthcare products are largely used in wound care (both advanced technologies used in hospital settings and consumer products found in retail) as well as medical device monitoring, consumer care, orthodontia, and diagnostic test strips. The addition of Scapa significantly increased our healthcare customer base, overall scale in the end-market, and portfolio of services and manufacturing technologies. Products sold into the healthcare end-market range from TPU and other films to specially formulated bandages to topicals and creams. 
Our sales to the construction end-market are comprised mostly of netting products for a range of erosion control products, often used in domestic highway and other development projects, and other products used in the transport of construction materials, sod production, and flooring, for example. We also produce films used in commercial architectural glass and specialty tapes used for various installation applications.
Our sales to the industrial end-market includes products for high-end coated digital printing, packaging, undersea cable wraps, consumer-oriented specialty tapes, and wind turbine production. These products are manufactured using a variety of our technologies. 
Sales and Distribution. AMS products are primarily sold by the marketing, sales and customer service organizations of our AMS operations directly to manufacturers, given the customized nature of many of our products. However, in some geographic regions, we use sales agents and distributors to assist us in the sales process. As part of our integration efforts related to our acquired companies, we re-branded most of the acquired companies and 
transitioned our AMS sales operations toward a more unified organization. All acquired companies have been, or are in the process of being, re-branded as SWM and the AMS sales organization will operate and go to market under the SWM trade name, with sales resources deployed by end-market and focused on selling products from across the totality of AMS offerings. We typically deliver our products to customers by truck, rail and ocean-going vessels. 
Competition. Our AMS products are typically leaders in their respective categories and compete against specialty products made by competitors such as Johns Manville, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Shaoxing Naite Plastics Co. Ltd., 3M Company, Covestro AG, ORAFOL Europe GmbH, Tenax Corporation, Intermas Group, Hollingsworth and Vose Company, Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc, tesa SE, and Avery Dennison. We believe our AMS products compete primarily on product features, innovations and customer service across the end-markets we serve, particularly in healthcare, transportation, and filtration. Of the end-markets we serve, construction and industrial are generally more price competitive due to a higher portion of commodity type products that we sell in this end-market. 
Raw Materials and Energy.  The primary raw material used in our AMS products is plastic resin, and we rely on a variety of commodity grade and specialty resins, including polypropylene, polyurethane, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyamide (nylon) and a selection of specialized high temperature engineering grade resins. Our thermoplastic nets and apertured films are produced using a blend of specialty resins and commodity grade resins like polypropylene. Resin prices can fluctuate significantly and can impact profitability. Commodity grade resin prices can sometimes correlate with crude oil prices while specialty resin prices often do not. Our TPU films are produced using specialty resins which are significantly more expensive than commodity grade resins.
We have multiple sources for most of our resin needs and believe that our purchased raw materials are generally available from several sources. For more commoditized resins, the loss of a single supplier would not likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to procure needed raw materials from other suppliers. However, some of our specialty resins are supplied by fewer manufacturers and our results could be more materially affected by the loss or disruption of supply of certain specialty resins from those producers. Our total resin purchases in 2021 and 2020 totaled $188 million and $112 million, respectively. 
The majority of our energy requirements relate to electricity in the U.S., and Europe. We consider this to be a relatively stable energy source.
Engineered Papers
Products. Our EP segment primarily produces tobacco-related papers including various papers used in cigarette production and reconstituted tobacco ("Recon"), a reprocessed tobacco material.
One of our key cigarette paper products is low ignition propensity ("LIP") cigarette paper. LIP cigarettes are designed to self-extinguish when not actively being smoked, thus offering a fire-safety feature. The U.S., the European Union ("E.U."), and several other smaller jurisdictions have mandated the use of LIP papers. Our solutions pioneered this cigarette paper category, and we remain a leader in this cigarette paper sub-segment through either direct sales or through licensing agreements. The Company maintains an extensive and active intellectual property ("IP") portfolio. 
Recon is another key component of EP's total sales and profits and is mainly comprised of reconstituted tobacco leaf, (“RTL” or “traditional RTL”), and wrapper and binder products. Traditional RTL is used by cigarette manufacturers to blend with virgin tobacco to achieve certain attributes in cigarettes. Recently, a new generation of tobacco industry products generally referred to as Heat not Burn (“HnB”) have been introduced into the marketplace with a goal of reducing harmful effects of smoking. We have enhanced our tobacco fiber reconstitution capabilities to produce materials suited for this new application, are generating increasing sales, and continue to develop products to meet increasing demand. Wrapper and binder product leverage our Recon technology for use in machine-made traditional and small cigars. 
Our non-tobacco paper products include a mix of lightweight papers including low-volume, high-value, engineered materials such as alkaline battery separator papers, as well as commodity paper grades for printing and writing, flooring laminates, and food service packaging, which typically have lower profitability are intended to maximize machine utilization. 
We intend to make continued investments in our EP segment to broaden our offerings, utilize existing machine capacity, and/or further monetize our paper making and reconstitution technologies. The Company continues to focus resources on innovation through activities in our OneFiber lab where paper customers can work closely with our technologists to develop improved paper-based and reconstituted botanical products. Our reconstitution technologies have potential to be utilized in products serving the cosmetics and packaging industries reprocessing botanical, vegetable, or other plant fibers. Furthermore, SWM’s Recon technologists are active in joint development with several customers to drive continued innovation and product commercialization in the rapidly emerging Heat not Burn tobacco product area. The Company has also responded to customer requests for industrial hemp fiber-based materials for use as wrappers and fillers and has developed products to meet demand for innovative hemp-based solutions.
Our wet-laid paper making technologies can be broadly classified into two main production processes: flat-wire production and incline-wire production. Generally, our machines are flat-wire, meaning a liquid slurry of short pulp fibers and water are laid onto flat-wire conveyor belts, with the water draining through the wire as the fibers (wood, flax, tobacco, etc.) bond together to form a paper sheet. Incline-wire machines allow for increased drainage, enabling the use of longer fibers which bond into a more open web, increasing the porosity. Incline wire machines are typically associated with higher-value products given this added porosity, which is important in filtration and other specialty applications that tend to justify premium pricing. 
Markets and Customers.  Our EP segment is heavily influenced by global smoking trends, particularly in the U.S., the E.U. (both LIP markets), and Brazil where we have the majority of our operations and highest share of the category's volume. Historically, mature geographic regions, such as the U.S. and the E.U. have exhibited a steady decline in smoking rates, often to the low-to-mid single digits. Overall, approximately 85% of EP segment sales in 2021 were to customers in the tobacco end-market, and approximately 15% of EP segment sales are related to a variety of non-tobacco customers and applications. Over time we expect non-tobacco customers to represent an increasing percentage of EP segment sales.
We supply the major, and many of the smaller, cigarette and cigar manufacturers. We sell our products directly to the major tobacco companies or their designated converters in the Americas, Europe, Asia and elsewhere. Philip Morris-USA, a subsidiary of Altria Group Inc., Philip Morris International ("PMI"), Imperial Brands Plc, Japan Tobacco Inc. ("JT"), and British American Tobacco ("BAT"), are our five largest customers and, together with their respective affiliates and designated converters, accounted for 14%, 29% and 32% of our 2021, 2020 and 2019 consolidated net sales, respectively. Although the total loss of one or more of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, we do not believe that such a loss is likely given our significance in the worldwide supply chain of cigarette-related papers.
Sales and Distribution. Our internal marketing, sales and customer service organizations sell most of our tobacco-related products directly to cigarette manufacturers or their designated converters. Most of our EP segment's non-tobacco related products are sold directly to manufacturers. In some geographic regions, we use sales agents. We do not sell our products directly to consumers or advertise our products in consumer media. We typically deliver our products to customers by truck, rail and ocean-going vessels. 
Competition.  The specialized nature of tobacco-related papers requires unique papermaking equipment, technical expertise, and research and development capabilities to meet exacting customer specifications. These factors have limited the number of competitors capable of servicing global cigarette manufacturers.
As the sole domestic producer of cigarette papers in the Americas, we believe that we have a significant majority of the category share in those regions. Our paper plants in France and LIP printing facility in Poland produce a large amount of the products sold in the E.U. We estimate that we have a direct share of approximately 40% to 50% of 
cigarette paper sales in the E.U., and coupled with royalty payments from a key competitor to whom we have licensed our LIP technology, we believe we are able to monetize over 80% of the LIP-compliant E.U. cigarette market. Our principal competitors include delfortgroup AG ("delfort"), which licenses our LIP technology, Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A. ("Miquel y Costas"), Julius Glatz GmbH ("Glatz") and PT Bukit Muria Jaya ("BMJ"). 
In December 2017, the Dusseldorf Court of Appeals affirmed the German District Court judgment of patent infringement against Glatz including an injunction against making and selling LIP cigarette paper. We believe that the basis of cigarette and our non-tobacco papers competition is price, consistent quality, security of supply, and level of technical service. 
Outside of China, SWM is the only non-cigarette company that produces RTL through a paper-making process. Some cigarette companies such as Philip Morris-USA, British American Tobacco, JT and STMA (China) produce RTL primarily for their own internal use. We believe we are the only non-cigarette manufacturer with production capabilities for HnB, as well as wrapper and binder products.
Raw Materials and Energy. Wood pulp is the primary fiber used in our EP segment. Our operations consumed approximately $39 million and $32 million of wood pulp in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, all of which we purchased. While EP uses other specialty fibers, such as flax, in our operations, we believe that purchased raw materials are generally available from several sources.
Paper production uses significant amounts of energy, primarily electricity, natural gas and fuel oil. We believe that energy supply is generally reliable throughout our manufacturing footprint, although prices can fluctuate significantly based on demand. We enter into agreements to procure a portion of our energy requirements for future periods in order to reduce the uncertainty of future energy costs. 
Additional information regarding agreements for the supply of certain raw materials and energy is included in Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Seasonality. Generally, sales of our paper and Recon products are subject to seasonal fluctuations due to periodic machine downtime and typically lower order volumes in the fourth quarter. Quarterly sales fluctuations can also be influenced by inventory building and/or destocking by our customers. 
Research and Development
As of December 31, 2021, we employ approximately 120 research and development employees in research and laboratory facilities in France, Brazil, the U.S and the United Kingdom. We are dedicated to developing product innovations and improvements to meet the needs of individual customers. We believe that our research and product development capabilities have played an important role in establishing our reputation for high quality, superior products in both our AMS and EP segments. Within AMS, we have a history of finding innovative design solutions, including developing products that improve the performance of customers' products and manufacturing operations. We believe that our commitment to research and development, coupled with our investment in new technology and equipment, has positioned us to take advantage of growth opportunities in many places around the world. Within EP, our research and development has enabled us to establish and sustain leading shares. We also are working with customers to meet increasing demand for reduced-risk tobacco products as well as hemp-based products. 
Intellectual Property
Patents, trade secrets and trademarks are an important part of SWM’s intellectual property. SWM’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. Many of the processes used to make SWM products are kept as trade secrets. SWM owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. SWM’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents or trade secrets. In general, no single patent or group of related patents is material to the conduct of SWM’s business as a whole or to any of SWM’s business segments. At December 31, 2021, SWM owned about 800 patents and patent applications globally.
Management of a large portion of SWM's research and development activities is provided from our Luxembourg City, Luxembourg operation ("SWM Luxembourg"). These activities are often performed at other SWM locations under contract by SWM Luxembourg, and funded by SWM Luxembourg. SWM Luxembourg has the authority to initiate and manage research and development projects in areas such as, but not limited to, LIP paper, Recon for HnB materials, non-tobacco paper products, adhesive tape and film products, wound care dressings, topical skin care treatments, netting, films, and other extruded resin products. This operation also provides global oversight and active management for much of the Company's intellectual property rights.
Human Capital
At SWM we understand that employees are our most important asset and as of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 5,100 regular, full-time, active employees. Our guiding principles create an environment where employees are encouraged to innovate and collaborate, acting as one company to place customers at the heart of our organization. Employee wellness and safety remain critical to our success. We have implemented proactive measures at our locations to help ensure workplace safety, including updated protocols to prevent and address potential or confirmed illness among our on-site workforce, additional spending on personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies, and dedicated time to perform additional sanitization procedures between shifts. We have increased the use of virtual platforms and tools, which has allowed many of our employees to work remotely. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We believe that employee relations are positive. Hourly employees at certain sites in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Brazil, France, and Italy are union represented.
Government Regulation
We are required to comply with numerous regulations that are normal and customary to businesses in the regions, industries, and markets in which we operate. These regulations include, but are not limited to, tax, employment, privacy, imports/exports, healthcare, environmental protection, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse, product safety and efficacy, and other areas.
Governmental entities around the world have taken, or have proposed, actions that had, or are likely to have, the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products which, in turn, reduces demand for our products. These actions, including efforts to regulate, restrict or prohibit the sale, advertisement and promotion of tobacco products and their components, to limit smoking in public places, to control or restrict additives that may be used in tobacco products and to increase taxes on such products, are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other tobacco products.
Our facilities are subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws with respect to air, water and emissions as well as the disposal of solid waste. We believe that we are operating in substantial compliance with these laws and regularly incur capital and operating expenditures in order to achieve future compliance. Although we are not aware of any environmental conditions at any of our facilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we own facilities in France, the U.S. and elsewhere that have been operated over the course of many decades. Should the Company make material changes in the operations at a facility it is possible such changes could generate environmental obligations that might require remediation or other action, the nature, extent and cost of which are not presently known. We may also face higher disposal and clean-up costs to replace equipment or facilities containing materials that were compliant when installed but are now considered contaminants. Additionally, as we sell closed or other facilities or materially alter operations at a facility, we may be required to perform additional environmental evaluations that could identify items that might require remediation or other action, the nature, extent and cost of which are not presently known. We may also incur environmental liabilities in connection with assets or businesses we may purchase in the future.
The Company is subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, the Company is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. Aspects of the Company’s operations and businesses are also subject to privacy, data security, and data protection regulations, which impact the way we use and handle data and operate our products and services.
The Company is not aware of any regulatory compliance matters that are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, competitive position, financial position, results of operations, capital expenditures or cash flows.
Environmental, Social and Governance
We believe that building long-term value for our customers, employees and stockholders includes a focus on ensuring the long-term sustainability of our business, good corporate citizenship, and contributing to our communities. Corporate responsibility has long been part of the SWM corporate mission and is one of our core values.

•Sustainable Packaging Material: We manufacture Cocoa PaperTM as packaging material. Cocoa PaperTM is made from botanical fibers and is biodegradable, compostable, and recyclable. Cocoa PaperTM fibers are 100% carbon neutral, a first in the Engineered Papers (EP) portfolio. Sales of Cocoa PaperTM benefit the Jacundá Forestry REDD+ Project in Brazil through the purchase of carbon credits to offset the impact of projected product sales.
•Sustainable Innovation: SWM developed RevonexTM membrane backing paper which improves reverse osmosis filtration efficiency by eliminating bleed-through. In addition, SWM developed a biodegradable cigarette filter media that is designed to replace cellulose acetate which contributes to microplastics pollution (or similar debris) in the ocean.
•Water Management: SWM’s FiltrexxTM brand is a global leader in research and development of compost-based Sustainable Management Practices (SMPs) for stormwater management, sediment & erosion control, pollutant removal and living walls applications. Filtrexx’s Installation Services are used by many companies in the oil and gas and construction industries. Additionally, certain of SWM’s products can be used in reverse osmosis water filters, supporting clean drinking water.
•Reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions and Supporting Air Quality: We recognize the importance of reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and have prioritized actions to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, such as the use of renewable energy sources, specific initiatives and equipment replacements intended to improve energy efficiency and incentives targeting energy use reductions in the Company’s operations.
•Partnership with Planet Water Foundation: SWM partners with Planet Water Foundation to support global efforts to improve access to clean, safe water. In the past two years, through our support, the Foundation installed AquaTower water systems in two communities without adequate access to safe water ― Jalisco, Mexico and the Siem Reap Province, Cambodia. Each AquaTower system can produce up to 1,000 liters of clean water per hour, addressing the drinking needs of up to 1,800 people with each tower. In 2021, SWM installed three AquaTower water systems, three accompanying AquaSan surface disinfection systems and hygiene education programs and two AquaHome systems to provide families with solar powered electricity and drinking water at home. 
•Ethical Sourcing: 100% of the wood pulp that SWM uses is sourced from legally harvested and well-managed forests. SWM maintains Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and/or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) certification at all but two of its facilities supplying timber-based products.
•Environmental Certification and Energy Efficiency: All of our Engineered Paper (EP) locations are certified to ISO 14001 for environmental management systems. Our mills in France are certified to the ISO 50001 energy management standard.
•Biodiversity Support: SWM has a history of supporting local biodiversity initiatives, such as the installation of salmon and eel runs in the Isole River near our EP facility in Quimperlé, France, and the planting of native trees and rebuilding of natural habitat near our plant in Santanesia, Brazil. 
•Recycling: Our U.S.-based Advanced Materials and Structures manufacturing sites have incorporated more than 2 million pounds of recycled plastic into new products and across SWM more than 1,000 tons of cardboard were recycled. Many other initiatives are in place involving the reuse of waste products and packaging materials.
Community Initiatives
•In addition to investing in area communities where our facilities are located by providing jobs and sourcing products, we support efforts to make our communities stronger through financial donations and volunteer participation. Most of our philanthropic efforts are locally directed, empowering our employees to contribute their time and expertise to organizations that matter to them and serve the unique needs of their communities. We donate to nonprofit or community organizations that support the communities where our plants are located. 
We continue to look for ways to enhance the sustainability of our business and make a positive impact on the communities in which we live and serve. 
Governance
SWM believes good corporate governance supports long-term value creation for our stockholders. The Governance section of the Investor Relations section of our website at www.swmintl.com includes our Code of Conduct, corporate governance guidelines, Board of Directors committee charters, as well as disclosure of any amendment to or waivers of our Code of Conduct granted to any of the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer. Information from our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional information about SWM's governance can also be found in our proxy statement. 
Working Capital
We normally maintain approximately 50 to 90 days of inventories to support our operations. Our sales terms average between 15 and 60 days for payment by our customers, dependent upon the products and market segment served. With respect to our accounts payable, we typically carry approximately 15 to 40 days outstanding, in accordance with our purchasing terms, which vary by business location. The accounts payable balance varies in relation to changes in our manufacturing operations, particularly due to changes in prices of wood pulp, resins and purchased energy and the level and timing of capital expenditures related to projects in progress.
