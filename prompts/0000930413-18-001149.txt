Item 1. Business
 
References to “we”, “us”, “our”, “REX” or “the Company” refer to REX American Resources Corporation and its majority owned subsidiaries.
 
Fiscal Year
 
All references in this report to a particular fiscal year are to REX’s fiscal year ended January 31. For example, “fiscal year 2017” means the period February 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018. We refer to our fiscal year by reference to the year immediately preceding the January 31 fiscal year end date.
Overview
 
REX was incorporated in Delaware in 1984 as a holding company. Our principal offices are located at 7720 Paragon Road, Dayton, Ohio 45459. Our telephone number is (937) 276-3931. We have been an investor in ethanol production facilities beginning in 2006. We are currently invested in three ethanol production entities; we have a majority ownership interest in two of these entities. We also own a majority interest in an entity that owns and operates a refined coal facility. We may make additional investments in the energy or other industries in the future. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we began reporting the results of our refined coal operation as a new segment as a result of the August 10, 2017 acquisition of an entity that operates a refined coal facility (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Prior to the acquisition, we had one reportable segment, ethanol. Beginning with the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we have two reportable segments: i) ethanol and by-products and ii) refined coal.

Our ethanol operations are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, ethanol, distillers grains, non-food grade corn oil and natural gas. As a result of price volatility for these commodities, our operating results can fluctuate substantially. The price and availability of corn is subject to significant fluctuations depending upon a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, federal policy and foreign trade. Because the market prices of ethanol and distillers grains are not always directly related to corn prices, at times ethanol and/or distillers grains prices may lag movements in corn prices and, in an environment of higher corn prices or lower ethanol/distillers grains prices, reduce the overall margin structure at the plants. As a result, at times, we may operate our plants at negative or minimally positive operating margins.
 
We expect our ethanol plants to produce approximately 2.8 gallons of denatured ethanol for each bushel of grain processed in the production cycle. We refer to the actual gallons of denatured ethanol produced per bushel of grain processed as the realized yield. We refer to the difference between the price per gallon of ethanol and the price per bushel of grain (divided by the realized yield) as the “crush spread.” Should the crush spread decline, it is possible that our ethanol plants will generate operating results that do not provide adequate cash flows for sustained periods of time. In such cases, production at the ethanol plants may be reduced or stopped altogether in order to minimize variable costs at individual plants. We also expect our ethanol plants to produce approximately 15.0 pounds of dried distillers grains and 0.8 pounds of non-food grade corn oil for each bushel of grain processed.
 
We attempt to manage the risk related to the volatility of commodity prices by utilizing forward grain purchase, forward ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil sale contracts and commodity futures agreements as management deems appropriate. We attempt to match quantities of these sales contracts with an appropriate quantity of grain purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain an adequate gross margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed. However, the market for future ethanol sales contracts generally lags the spot market with respect to ethanol price. Consequently, we generally execute fixed price contracts for no more than four months into the future at any given time and we may lock in our corn or ethanol price without having a corresponding locked in ethanol or corn price for short durations of time. As a result of the relatively short period of time our fixed price contracts cover, we generally cannot predict the future movements in the crush spread for more than four months; thus, we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future income or loss from the operations of our ethanol facilities. We utilize derivative financial instruments, primarily exchange traded commodity future contracts, in conjunction with certain of our grain procurement activities.
 
Commodity prices in fiscal year 2017 were subject to significant volatility. For fiscal year 2017, the average Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) near-month corn price ranged from a low of approximately $3.29 per bushel in August 2017 to a high of approximately $4.02 per bushel in July 2017. Corn prices benefitted throughout the year from consecutive strong corn harvests in 2016 and 2017. Ethanol prices had significant fluctuations ranging from approximately $1.26 per gallon in December 2017 to a high of approximately $1.67 per gallon in April 2017. Ethanol prices were influenced by many factors throughout the year including low energy prices, varying levels of domestic and import/export ethanol demand and increases in United States ethanol production.
 
On August 10, 2017, we purchased for approximately $12.0 million, the entire ownership interest of an entity that owns a refined coal facility through a 95.35% owned subsidiary. We began operating the refined coal facility immediately after the acquisition. We expect that the revenues from the sale of refined coal produced in the facility will be subsidized by federal production tax credits through November 2021, subject to meeting qualified emissions reductions as governed by Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). In order to maintain compliance with Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code, we are required to test every six months, through an independent laboratory, the effectiveness of our operations with respect to emissions reductions. Annually, the IRS publishes the amount of federal income tax credit earned per ton of refined

coal produced and sold for a given calendar year. We expect to earn credits at the rate of approximately $6.91 per ton of refined coal produced and sold during fiscal year 2017.
 
Net income attributable to REX common shareholders was approximately $39.7 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to approximately $32.3 million in fiscal year 2016. The current year benefitted from reductions in our effective tax rate resulting from tax reform legislation and the impact of Section 45 federal income tax credits from our refined coal operations. Gross profit in fiscal year 2017 was significantly lower compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily a result of lower crush spreads and distillers grains pricing as well as the impact of our refined coal facility which generated a gross loss. Due to the inherent volatility of commodity prices within the ethanol industry, the uncertainty regarding future refined coal production and associated financial results, and the impact of tax reform legislation, we cannot predict the likelihood of future operating results being similar to the fiscal year 2017 results.
 
During fiscal year 2013, we entered into a joint venture with Hytken HPGP LLC (“Hytken”) to file and defend patents for eSteam technology relating to heavy oil and oil sands production methods, and to attempt to commercially exploit the technology to generate license fees, royalty income and development opportunities. The patented technology is an enhanced method of heavy oil recovery involving zero emissions downhole steam generation. To date, we have paid approximately $1.8 million for our ownership interest, patent and other expenses, but have not successfully demonstrated that the technology is commercially feasible. We own 60% and Hytken owns 40% of the entity named Future Energy, LLC (“Future Energy”), an Ohio limited liability company. Future Energy is managed by a board of three managers, two appointed by us and one by Hytken.
 
We plan to seek and evaluate various investment opportunities including energy related, agricultural or other ventures we believe fit our investment criteria. We can make no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to find such opportunities.
 
Ethanol and by-products Overview
 
We began investing in the ethanol industry during fiscal year 2006. The form and structure of our investments is tailored to the specific needs and goals of each project and the local farmer group or investor with whom we are partnering. We generally participate in the management of our projects through our membership on the board of managers of the limited liability companies that own the plants.
 
We have equity investments in three entities engaged in the production of ethanol as of January 31, 2018. The following table is a summary of our ethanol investments at January 31, 2018 (gallons in millions):
 

Entity | Trailing 12 Months Ethanol Gallons Shipped | | REX’s Current Ownership Interest | | Current Effective Ownership of Trailing 12 Months Ethanol Gallons Shipped

Ethanol Industry
 
Ethanol is a renewable fuel source produced by processing corn and other biomass through a fermentation process that creates combustible alcohol that can be used as an additive or replacement to fossil fuel based gasoline. The majority of ethanol produced in the United States is made from corn because of its wide availability and ease of convertibility from large amounts of carbohydrates into glucose, the key ingredient in producing alcohol that is used in the fermentation process. Ethanol production can also use feedstocks such as grain sorghum, switchgrass, wheat, barley, potatoes and sugarcane as carbohydrate sources. Most ethanol plants have been located near large corn production areas, such as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio and South Dakota. Railway access and interstate access are vital for ethanol facilities due to the large amount of raw materials and finished goods required to be shipped to and from the ethanol plant facilities.
 
According to the Renewable Fuels Association (“RFA”), the United States ethanol industry produced an estimated 15.8 billion gallons of ethanol in 2017. Approximately 14.4 billion gallons were blended domestically and approximately 1.3 billion gallons were exported in 2017. According to the RFA, as of January 2018, the United States ethanol industry consists of 211 plants (201 operating) in 28 states with an annual capacity of approximately 16.2 billion gallons (approximately 15.8 billion gallons at operating plants) of ethanol production. The RFA estimates that, as of January 2018, approximately 465 million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction or expansion.
 
On December 19, 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (the “Energy Act of 2007”) was enacted. The Energy Act of 2007 established new levels of renewable fuel mandates, including two different categories of renewable fuels: conventional biofuels and advanced biofuels. Corn-based ethanol is considered a conventional biofuel which is subject to a renewable fuel standard (“RFS”) of 15.0 billion gallons annually through 2022. After 2022, RFS volumes will be determined by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture.
 
The federal government mandates the use of renewable fuels under RFS II, established in October 2010. The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if one of two conditions is met: 1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply, or 2) implementation of the mandate requirement severely harms the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, the EPA took action to reduce the volumes for both conventional biofuels and advanced biofuels.
 
The U.S. Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit ruled on July 28, 2017, in favor of the Americans for Clean Energy and its petitioners against the EPA related to its decision to lower the 2016 volume requirements. The Court concluded the EPA erred in how it interpreted the “inadequate domestic supply” waiver provision of RFS II, which authorizes the EPA to consider supply-side factors affecting the volume of renewable fuel available to refiners, blenders, and importers to meet the statutory volume requirements. The waiver provision does not allow the EPA to consider the volume of renewable fuel available to consumers or the demand-side constraints that affect the consumption of renewable fuel by consumers. As a result, the Court vacated the EPA’s decision to reduce the total renewable fuel volume requirements for 2016 through its waiver authority, which the EPA is expected to address.
 
Pursuant to RFS II, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. While conventional ethanol maintained 15.0 billion gallons, 2018 is the first year the total proposed renewable volume obligations (“RVOs”) are more than 20% below statutory volumes levels. Thus, the EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the required technical analysis to perform any future reset consistent with the reset rules. The reset will be triggered if the 2019 RVOs continue to be more than 20% below the statutory levels, and the EPA

will be required to modify statutory volumes through 2022 within one year of the trigger event, based on the same factors used to set the RVOs post-2022.
 
Obligated parties use renewable identification numbers (“RINs”) to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. Certain obligated parties petitioned the EPA to move the point of obligation from refiners and importers of fuel to fuel blenders. In November 2017, the EPA denied this petition to change the point of obligation under RFS II to the parties that own the gasoline before it is sold.
 
On January 26, 2018, in separate court actions, both Valero Energy and American Fuel and Petrochemical and Manufacturers challenged the EPA regarding the EPA’s management of the U.S. biofuel mandate. Amongst their challenges are the EPA’s November 2017 decision to reject proposed changes to the structure of the RFS including the point of obligation, and the plaintiffs are seeking a review of the annual Renewable Volume Obligations rule set by the EPA for 2018 and 2019.
 
Ethanol Production
 
The plants we have invested in are designed to use the dry milling method of producing ethanol. In the dry milling process, the entire corn kernel is first ground into flour, which is referred to as “meal,” and processed without separating out the various component parts of the grain. The meal is processed with enzymes, chemicals and water, and then placed in a high-temperature cooker. It is then transferred to fermenters where yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to ethanol begins. After fermentation, the resulting liquid is transferred to distillation columns where the ethanol is separated from the remaining “stillage” for fuel uses. The anhydrous ethanol is then blended with a denaturant, such as natural gasoline, to render it undrinkable and thus not subject to beverage alcohol tax. With the starch elements of the corn consumed in the above described process, the principal co-product produced by the dry milling process is dry distillers grains with solubles, or DDGS. DDGS is sold as a protein used in animal feed, which recovers a portion of the corn cost not absorbed in ethanol production. We also generate revenues from the sale of non-food grade corn oil produced at our facilities. Non-food grade corn oil is sold to the animal feed market, as well as biodiesel and other chemical markets.
The Primary Uses of Ethanol
 
Blend component. Today, much of the ethanol blending in the U.S. is done to meet the RFS. Currently, ethanol is blended into approximately 98% of the gasoline sold in the United States, the majority as E-10 (a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline), according to the RFA. Going forward, the industry is attempting to expand the E-85 market, as well as to raise the federal cap on ethanol blend above the current 10% for most vehicles in use. The EPA has approved the use of 15% ethanol in gasoline for cars, SUV’s and light duty trucks made in 2001 and later. Despite this, it will take time for this measure to be implemented, and it is still being met with great resistance. Ethanol accounted for approximately 10.1% of the total U.S. gasoline supply for 2016 and 2017.
 
Clean air additive. Ethanol is employed by the refining industry as a fuel oxygenate, which when blended with gasoline, allows engines to combust fuel more completely and reduce emissions from motor vehicles. Ethanol contains 35% oxygen, which results in more complete combustion of the fuel in the engine cylinder. Oxygenated gasoline is used to help meet certain federal and air emission standards.

Octane enhancer.  Ethanol increases the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended. As such, ethanol is used by gasoline suppliers as an octane enhancer both for producing regular grade gasoline from lower octane blending stocks and for upgrading regular gasoline to premium grades.
 
Legislation
 
The United States ethanol industry is highly dependent upon federal and state legislation. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of legislation affecting the U.S. ethanol industry.
Refined Coal Overview
 
On August 10, 2017, we purchased the entire ownership interest of an entity that owns a refined coal facility through a 95.35% owned subsidiary. We began operating the refined coal facility immediately after the acquisition. Using licensed technology, our plant applies two separate chemicals to convert feedstock coal into refined coal, which is sold to the end user of the refined coal. We expect that the revenues from the sale of refined coal produced in the facility will be subsidized by federal production tax credits through November 2021, subject to meeting qualified emissions reductions as governed by Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). In order to maintain compliance with Section 45 of the IRC, we are required to test every six months, through an independent laboratory, the effectiveness of our operations with respect to emissions reductions. Annually, the IRS publishes the amount of federal income tax credit earned per ton of refined coal produced and sold for a given calendar year. We expect to earn credits at the rate of approximately $6.91 per ton of refined coal produced and sold during fiscal year 2017.
 
Section 45 of the IRC was created by Congress to encourage the development and use of environmentally sound solutions to control harmful emissions during energy production and to facilitate and move the United States towards better compliance with global environmental energy standards. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 amended Section 45 of the IRC by adding provisions to incentivize the production of emission reducing refined coal. To qualify for tax credits under Section of the IRC, a process must reduce coal emissions of nitrogen oxide by 20% and either sulfur dioxide or mercury by 40%. The tax credits can be earned for refined coal produced and sold by our facility through November 2021.
 
Facilities
 
At January 31, 2018, our consolidated ethanol entities own a combined 477 acres of land and two facilities that shipped a combined quantity of approximately 256 million gallons of ethanol in fiscal year 2017. We also own our corporate headquarters office building, consisting of approximately 7,500 square feet, located in Dayton, Ohio. We own a refined coal plant that is located on leased property on the site of an electrical generating station.
Employees
 
At January 31, 2018, we had 120 employees at our two consolidated ethanol plants and at our corporate headquarters. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We expect this employment level to remain relatively stable. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Service Marks
 
We have registered the service marks “REX”, and “Farmer’s Energy”, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We are not aware of any adverse claims concerning our service marks.
