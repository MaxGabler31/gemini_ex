Item 1. Business
We have been a technology leader for 50 years with a strong history of innovation. While the traditional focus of our cutting-edge technology has been on the exploration and production (“E&P”) industry, we are now broadening and diversifying our business into relevant adjacent markets such as offshore logistics, military and marine robotics. 
Leveraging innovative technologies, we create value through data capture, analysis and optimization to enhance companies’ critical decision-making abilities and returns. Our E&P offerings are focused on improving decision-making, enhancing reservoir management and optimizing offshore operations. They are designed to allow oil and gas companies to obtain higher resolution images of the Earth’s subsurface to reduce their risk in hydrocarbon exploration and development. We acquire, process and interpret seismic data from seismic surveys on a multi-client or proprietary basis. Seismic surveys for our multi-client data library business are pre-funded, or underwritten, in part by our customers, and we contract with third party seismic data acquisition companies to acquire the seismic data, all of which is intended to minimize our risk exposure. We serve customers in most major energy producing regions of the world from strategically located offices in 21 cities on six continents.
Seismic imaging plays a fundamental role in hydrocarbon exploration and reservoir development by delineating structures, rock types and fluid locations in the subsurface. Our technologies, services and solutions are used by E&P companies to generate high-resolution images of the Earth’s subsurface to identify hydrocarbons and pinpoint drilling locations for wells and to monitor production from existing wells.
We provide our services and products through three business segments - E&P Technology & Services, Operations Optimization (formerly referred to as E&P Operations Optimization), and Ocean Bottom Integrated Technologies (formerly referred to as Ocean Bottom Seismic Services). In addition, we have a 49% ownership interest in our INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited joint venture (“INOVA Geophysical,” or “INOVA”).
The advanced technologies we currently offer include our Orca® and Gator™ command and control software systems, Full Waveform Inversion (“FWI”) data processing technology, our OBS acquisition systems, and other technologies, each of which is designed to deliver improvements in image quality, safety and/or productivity. In 2015, we introduced Marlin™ to optimize operations offshore. In 2017, we introduced our new fully integrated nodal system, 4Sea™ which is designed to deliver a step change in economics, QHSE performance and final image delivery time, creating more value for clients by providing data in time for critical reservoir decision, such as determining drilling locations and informing enhanced recovery techniques.
We have approximately 500 patents and pending patent applications in various countries around the world. Approximately 42% of our employees are involved in technical roles and over 21% of our employees have advanced degrees.
E&P Technology & Services. Our E&P Technology & Services business provides three distinct service activities that often work together.
Our E&P Technology & Services creates digital data assets and delivers services to help E&P companies improve decision-making, reduce risk and maximize value. For example, E&P Technology & Services provides information to better understand new frontiers or complex subsurface geologies, how to maximize portfolio value, or how to optimize license round success and acreage values. 
Our Ventures group leverages the world-class geoscience skills of both the Imaging Services and E&P Advisors groups to create global digital data assets that are licensed to multiple E&P companies to optimize their investment decisions. Our global data library consists of over 614,000 km of 2-D and over 224,000 sq. km of 3-D multi-client seismic data in virtually all major offshore petroleum provinces. Ventures provides services to manage multi-client or proprietary surveys, from survey planning and design to data acquisition and management, to final subsurface imaging and reservoir characterization. We focus on the technologically intensive components of the image development process, such as survey planning and design, and data 
4


processing and interpretation, while outsourcing asset-intensive components (such as field acquisition) to experienced contractors. 
Our Imaging Services group offers data processing and imaging services designed to maximize image quality, helping E&P companies reduce exploration and production risk, evaluate and develop reservoirs, and increase production. Imaging Services develops subsurface images by applying its processing technology to data owned or licensed by its customers. We maintain approximately 19 petabytes of digital seismic data storage in four global data centers, including two core data centers located in Houston and in the U.K. 
Our E&P Advisors’ strategy is to provide technical, commercial and strategic advice to host governments, E&P companies and private equity firms to evaluate and market oil and gas opportunities and/or assets worldwide, sharing in the value we create.
Operations Optimization. Our Operations Optimization segment develops mission-critical subscription offerings and provides engineering services that enable operational control and optimization offshore. This segment is comprised of our Optimization Software & Services and Devices offerings. 
Our Optimization Software & Services group provides survey design and command and control software systems and related services for marine towed streamer and seabed operations. Our Orca software is installed on towed streamer marine vessels worldwide, and our Gator software is used by seabed crews. Our latest offering, Marlin is used to optimize offshore operations. 
Our Devices group is engaged in the manufacture and repair of marine towed streamer positioning and control systems, analog geophone sensors and compasses which have been deployed in marine robotics, scientific, E&P and other commercial applications. 
Ocean Bottom Integrated Technologies. Higher quality data can be acquired from the sea floor compared to the traditional method of acquiring it near the surface, which enables companies to have a better image and better understanding of the subsurface to make optimal reservoir decisions. ION provides a full suite of technology and services that includes survey design, planning, acquisition, data processing, interpretation and reservoir services to optimize image quality, operational efficiency and safety. ION’s Ocean Bottom Integrated Technologies group integrates a variety of ION’s advanced technologies to accelerate Ocean Bottom Seismic (“OBS”) data capture and delivery for our clients’ enhanced reservoir decision-making, and improved returns. 
Our team develops re-deployable ocean bottom data acquisition technology. In 2017, we introduced 4Sea, our new fully integrated ocean bottom system. 4Sea is differentiated in its ability to deliver a step change in economics, QHSE performance and final image delivery time, creating more value for the client by providing information in time for critical decisions, such as determining drilling locations, fluid injections, and the like. 
We have continued to evolve our strategy for our Ocean Bottom Integrated Technologies segment consistent with our asset light business model. The remaining elements of our next generation ocean bottom nodal system, 4Sea, will be commercialized in 2019. We are offering 4Sea components more broadly to the growing number of OBS service providers under recurring revenue commercial strategies that will enable us to share in the value our technology delivers. We may also license the right to manufacture and use the fully integrated system to a service provider on a value-based pricing model, such as a royalty stream. Such licensing would be recognized through the relevant segment, either E&P Technology & Services or Operations Optimization. While not our primary route to market, we continue to evaluate acquisition projects on a case-by-case basis that meet our long-term risk and return thresholds. 
INOVA Geophysical. We conduct our land seismic equipment business through INOVA Geophysical, a joint venture with BGP Inc., a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (“CNPC”). BGP is generally regarded as the world’s largest land geophysical service contractor. BGP owns a 51% equity interest in INOVA Geophysical, and we own the remaining 49% interest. INOVA manufactures land seismic data acquisition systems, digital sensors, vibroseis vehicles (i.e., vibrator trucks), and energy source controllers. We wrote our investment in INOVA down to zero as of December 31, 2014. 
Seismic Industry Overview
1930s – 1970s. Since the 1930s, oil and gas companies have sought to reduce exploration risk by using seismic data to create an image of the Earth’s subsurface. Seismic data is recorded when listening devices placed on the Earth’s surface, ocean bottom floor, or carried within the streamer cable of a towed streamer vessel, measure how long it takes for sound vibrations to echo off rock layers underground. For seismic data acquisition onshore, the acoustic energy producing the sound vibrations is generated by the detonation of small explosive charges or by large vibroseis (vibrator) vehicles. In marine acquisition, the energy is provided by a series of source arrays that deliver compressed air into the water column.

The acoustic energy propagates through the subsurface as a spherical wave front, or seismic wave. Interfaces between different types of rocks will both reflect and transmit this wave front. Onshore, the reflected signals return to the surface where they are measured by sensitive receivers that are analog coil-spring geophones. Offshore, the reflected signals are recorded by either hydrophones towed in an array behind a streamer acquisition vessel or by multicomponent geophones or MEMS sensors that are placed directly on the ocean floor. Once the recorded seismic energy is processed using advanced algorithms and workflows, images of the subsurface can be created to depict the structure, lithology (rock type), fracture patterns, and fluid content of subsurface horizons, highlighting the most promising places to drill for oil and natural gas. This processing also aids in engineering decisions, such as drilling and completion methods, as well as decisions affecting overall reservoir production and economic decisions relating to drilling risk and reserves in place.
Typically, an E&P company engages the services of a geophysical acquisition contractor to develop a seismic survey design, secure permits, coordinate logistics, and acquire seismic data in a selected area. The E&P company generally relies on third parties, such as ION, to provide the contractor with equipment, navigation and data management software, and field support services necessary for data acquisition. After the data is collected, the same geophysical contractor, a third-party data processing company, or the E&P company itself will process the data using proprietary algorithms and workflows to create a series of seismic images. Geoscientists then interpret the data by reviewing the images of the subsurface and integrating the geophysical data with other geological and production information such as well logs or core information.
During the 1960s, digital seismic data acquisition systems (which converted the analog output from the geophones into digital data for recording) and computers for seismic data processing were introduced. Using the new systems and computers, the signals could be recorded on magnetic tape and sent to data processors where they could be adjusted and corrected for known distortions. The final processed data was displayed in a form known as “stacked” data. Computer filing, storage, database management, and algorithms used to process the raw data quickly grew more sophisticated, dramatically increasing the amount of subsurface seismic information.
1980s. Until the early 1980s, the primary commercial seismic imaging technology was 2-Dimension (“2-D”). 2-D seismic data is recorded using a single line of receivers. Once processed, 2-D seismic data allows geoscientists to see only a thin vertical slice of the Earth, and that image may be distorted by reflections originating out of the place of the receiver line. A geoscientist using 2-D seismic technology must speculate on the characteristics of the Earth between the slices and attempt to visualize the true 3-Dimension (“3-D”) structure of the subsurface.
The commercial development of 3-D imaging technology in the early 1980s was an important technological milestone for the seismic industry. Previously, the high cost of 3-D seismic data acquisition techniques and the lack of computing power necessary to process, display, and interpret 3-D data on a commercial basis slowed its widespread adoption. Today’s 3-D seismic techniques record the reflected energy across a patch of receivers that collectively provide a more holistic, spatially-sampled depiction of geological horizons and, in some cases, rock and fluid properties, within the Earth.
3-D seismic data and the associated computer-based processing platforms enable geoscientists to generate more accurate subsurface maps than could be constructed from 2-D seismic lines. In particular, 3-D seismic data provided more detailed information about and higher-quality images of subsurface structures, including the geometry of bedding layers, salt structures, and fault planes. The improved 3-D seismic images enabled the oil and gas industry to discover new reservoirs, reduce finding and development costs, and lower overall hydrocarbon exploration risk. Driven by faster computers and more sophisticated mathematical equations to process the data, the technology advanced quickly.
1990s. As commodity prices decreased in the late 1990s and the pace of innovation in 3-D seismic imaging technology slowed, E&P companies slowed the commissioning of new seismic surveys. Also, business practices employed by geophysical contractors impacted demand for seismic data. In an effort to sustain higher utilization of existing capital assets, geophysical contractors increasingly began to collect speculative seismic data for their own data libraries in the hopes of selling it later to E&P companies. There became an abundance of speculative multi-client data in many regions. Additionally, since contractors incurred most of the costs of this speculative seismic data at the time of acquisition, contractors lowered prices to recover as much of their investment as possible, which drove operating margins down. During the 1990’s, the accuracy of 3-D seismic surveys improved to the point that a survey acquired after significant oil production could be compared to a pre-production survey, and a map of the drainage pattern of the reservoir could be produced. This technique became known as time lapse, or 4-D seismic.
2000s. The conditions from the 1990s continued to prevail until 2004-2005, when commodity prices began increasing and E&P companies increased capital spending programs, driving higher demand for our services and products. During this time, the use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing increased, as onshore North American production became economically viable with higher oil prices. These techniques, used to extract oil from and gas from unconventional reservoirs, made once “hard to produce” oil and gas accessible and caused an upsurge in North American onshore oil and gas activity. An increased use of the 4-D seismic technology has been noted during the 2000s where its value in reservoir management, increasing reserves, upping recovery and optimizing infill well locations has been established.

The financial crisis that occurred in 2008 and the resulting economic downturn drove hydrocarbon prices down sharply, reducing exploration activities in North America and in many parts of the world. However, crude oil prices rebounded and were fairly consistent from 2011-2014 exceeding $100 per barrel, and U.S. oil production exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts. In late 2014, however, oil prices began to decline significantly, dropping by approximately half and continued into 2015 and 2016 as signs emerged that non-U.S. demand was weakening.
During 2017 and 2018, crude oil prices rebounded resulting from sustained production cut by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) that reduced the overall crude supply. In late 2018, crude oil prices began to decline again due to slower than expected pace of global demand growth and record level crude oil production growth. Since 2015, Oil companies have prioritized shareholder returns and cash flow generation over hydrocarbon resource growth, reducing discretionary spending and shifting their focus from exploration to production. This shift caused a contraction in E&P spending, especially on seismic data and services for exploration. In addition, E&P companies have tended to shift toward reprocessing existing seismic data as a more cost-effective alternative to acquiring new data where possible.
Our Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are to:

• | Leverage our key technologies to create value through data capture, analysis and optimization to enhance companies’ critical decision-making abilities and returns. Decisions today are increasingly complex with huge amounts of data to comprehend. Companies capable of translating raw data into actionable insights gain a competitive edge and deliver superior returns. ION offerings are focused on improving E&P decision-making, enhancing reservoir management and optimizing offshore operations. E&P Technology & Services creates digital data assets and delivers services that improve decision-making, mitigate risk and maximize portfolio value for E&P companies, such as our multi-client programs that are licensed to multiple E&P companies to optimize their investment decisions. Operations Optimization develops mission-critical subscription offerings and engineering services that enable operational control and optimization offshore. Ocean Bottom Integrated Technologies integrates a variety of ION’s advanced technologies to accelerate data capture and delivery. This information enables E&P companies to enhance their reservoir decision-making and improve their returns. 


• | Expand and globalize our E&P Technology & Services business. We seek to expand and grow our E&P Technology & Services business into new regions, with new customers and new offerings, including data processing services through our Imaging Services group and our Ventures multi-client and proprietary programs. Historically known for our 2-D programs, we entered the 3-D multi-client market in 2014 by acquiring and processing our first survey offshore Ireland. Since then, we have expanded our 3-D seismic data library considerably by purchasing existing seismic data and reimaging the data by using new data processing techniques and algorithms, such as our advanced FWI. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue investing in research and development and computing infrastructure for our data processing business and to support our multi-client projects. We believe this focus better positions our company as a full-service technology company with an increasing proportion of revenues derived from E&P customers. In 2018, E&P companies accounted for approximately 77% of our total consolidated net revenues. 


• | Continue investing in advanced software and equipment technology to provide next generation services and products. We intend to continue investing in the development of new technologies for use by E&P companies. In particular, we intend to focus on the development of our next generation OBS technology, our Marlin operations optimization software, and derivative products and continued advancement of our FWI and ocean bottom nodal algorithms, with the goal of obtaining technical and market leadership in what we continue to believe are important and expanding markets. In 2018, our total investment in research and development and engineering was equal to approximately 10% of our total consolidated net revenues for the year.


• | Collaborate with our customers to provide products and solutions designed to meet their needs. A key element of our business strategy has been to understand the challenges faced by E&P companies in seismic survey planning, data acquisition, processing, and interpretation. We will continue to develop and offer technology and services that enable us to work with E&P companies to solve their unique challenges around the world. We have found collaborating with E&P companies to better understand their imaging challenges and working with them to ensure the right technologies are properly applied, is the most effective method for meeting their needs. Helping solve the most difficult challenges for our customers is an important element of our long-term business strategy, and we are implementing this partnership approach globally through local personnel in our regional organizations who understand the unique challenges in their areas. We formed an E&P Advisors group in 2015 designed to focus specifically on this element of our strategy.

• | Expand our Operations Optimization business into relevant adjacent markets. While our traditional focus for technology has been on the E&P industry, we are broadening and diversifying our software and equipment businesses into relevant adjacent markets such as offshore logistics, military and marine robotics. Adjacent markets broaden our opportunity to better monetize our return on technology investments while reducing our susceptibility to E&P cycles. We intend to derive a significant portion of revenues from these non-E&P markets over the next 5 years. 

Our Strengths
We believe that we are solidly positioned to successfully execute the key elements of our business strategy based on the following competitive strengths:

• | We leverage our innovative technologies to create value through data capture, analysis and optimization to enhance companies’ critical decision-making abilities and returns. Our cutting-edge data management and analysis platforms help derive insights from data we acquire to improve E&P decision-making, enhance reservoir management and optimize offshore operations. The data can be used to decide whether and how much to bid on a block, how to maximize production from a field, or how to optimize the safety and efficiency of complex maritime projects. Our operations optimization platform and imaging engine are the core underlying technology and we continually advance our complex algorithms to improve the resulting analysis. 


• | We focus on higher potential return offerings and creative business models to maximize shareholder value. We streamlined our business and focused on the areas with the highest potential returns because we believe every dollar invested should go further. In addition, we try to structure both the project financing and payment in a way to maximize profit, such as sharing in the success of a project. 


• | Our “asset light” strategy enables us to avoid significant fixed costs and remain financially flexible. We do not own a fleet of marine vessels and do not provide our own crews to acquire seismic data. We outsource seismic data acquisition activity to third parties that operate fleets of seismic vessels and equipment. This practice enables us to avoid fixed costs associated with these assets and personnel and to manage our business in a manner designed to afford us the flexibility to quickly scale up or down our capital investments based on E&P spending levels. We actively manage the costs of developing our multi-client data library business by having our customers partially pre-fund, or underwrite, the investment for any new project. Our target goal is to have a vast majority of the total cost of each new project’s data acquisition to be underwritten by our customers. We believe this conservative approach to data library investment is the most prudent way to reduce the impact of any sudden reduction in the demand for seismic data, giving us the flexibility to aggressively reduce cash outflows as we have successfully implemented in the current industry downturn.


• | Our global footprint and diversified portfolio approach enable us to offset regional downturns. Conducting business around the world has been and will continue to be a key component of our strategy. This global focus and diversified portfolio approach has been helpful in minimizing the impact of any regional or country-specific slowdown for short or extended periods of time. While the traditional focus of our cutting-edge technology has been on the E&P industry, we are now broadening and diversifying our business into relevant adjacent markets such as offshore logistics, military and marine robotics. Adjacent markets broaden our opportunity to better monetize our return on technology investments while reducing our susceptibility to E&P cycles. 


• | We have a diversified and blue chip customer base. We provide services and products to a diverse, global customer base that includes many of the largest oil and gas and geophysical companies in the world, including National Oil Companies (“NOCs”) and International Oil Companies (“IOCs”). Over the past decade, we have made significant progress expanding our customer list and revenue sources. Whereas almost all of our revenues in the early 2000s were derived principally from seismic service providers, in 2018, E&P companies accounted for approximately 77% of our total consolidated net revenues.

Services and Products
E&P Technology & Services Segment
Our E&P Technology & Services segment includes the following:
Ventures — Our Ventures group provides complete seismic data services, from survey planning and design through data acquisition to final subsurface imaging and reservoir characterization. We work backwards through the seismic workflow, with the final image in mind, to select the optimal survey design, acquisition technology, and processing techniques.

We offer our services to customers on both a proprietary and multi-client (non-exclusive) basis. In both cases, the customers generally pre-fund a majority of the survey costs. The period during which our multi-client surveys are being designed, acquired or processed is referred to as the “New Venture” phase. For proprietary services, the customer has exclusive ownership of the data. For multi-client surveys, we generally retain ownership of or long-term exclusive marketing rights to the data and receive ongoing revenue from subsequent data license sales.
Since 2002, we have acquired and processed a growing multi-client data library consisting of non-exclusive marine and ocean bottom data from around the world. The majority of the data licensed by ION consists of ultra-deep 2-D seismic data that E&P companies use to evaluate petroleum systems at the basin level, including insights into the character of source rocks and sediments, migration pathways, and reservoir trapping mechanisms. In some cases, we extend beyond seismic data to include magnetic, gravity, well log, and electromagnetic information, to provide a more comprehensive picture of the subsurface. Known as “BasinSPAN” programs, these geophysical surveys cover most major offshore basins worldwide and we continue to build on them. In addition to our 2-D multi-client programs, in 2013, we acquired our first 3-D marine proprietary program, then in 2014, in collaboration with Polarcus Limited, a marine geophysical company, we jointly acquired and processed our first 3-D survey offshore Ireland.
 In 2016, we began a 3-D multi-client broadband reimaging program offshore Mexico in collaboration with Schlumberger leveraging Mexico's National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) data library. The successful Campeche program has since expanded due to customer demand and now consists of approximately 100,000 km2 offshore southern Mexico. Since 2016, we have added an additional 216,000 km2 of 3-D data offshore Mexico and in Brazil. Our programs in Brazil make up a significant portion of our backlog at December 31, 2018. 
We also have a library of 3-D onshore reservoir imaging and characterization programs that provide E&P companies with the ability to better understand unconventional reservoirs to maximize production. Known as “ResSCAN™” programs, these 3-D multicomponent seismic data programs were designed, acquired and depth-imaged using advanced geophysical technology and proprietary processing techniques, resulting in high-definition images of the subsurface. 
Imaging Services — Our Imaging Services group provides advanced marine and land seismic data processing and imaging. In addition to applying processing and imaging technologies to data we own or data licensed by our customers, we also provide our customers with seismic data acquisition support services, such as data pre-conditioning for imaging and quality control of seismic data acquisition. 
We utilize a globally distributed network of Linux-cluster processing centers in combination with our major hubs in Houston and London to process seismic data using advanced, proprietary algorithms and workflows. 
Our Imaging Services team has pioneered several differentiated processing and imaging solutions for both offshore and onshore environments including: Reverse Time Migration (RTM), Surface Related Multiple Elimination (SRME), and WiBand broadband deghosting. In 2013, we released FWI and non-parametric picking Tomography techniques to improve subsurface image resolution in areas with complex geologies. The advantages of these techniques are that they allow for the resolution of complex, small-scale velocity variations. We continue to research and develop processing and imaging technologies for commercial application, including our latest developments in Reflection FWI and Least Squares RTM. In addition to improving our algorithms, we also continue to optimize the efficiency of our proprietary software, Perseus, such that we can turnaround larger projects faster, e.g. a 42,000 km2 fast track product in the Northern Campeche Basin in Mexico in just 6 weeks.  Our continued investment in hardware infrastructure complements these research and development efforts, ensuring faster turnaround time and less expensive computational costs for clients, whether they are seeking 2-D, 3-D, proprietary, multi-client, towed streamer or seabed solutions.
At December 31, 2018, our E&P Technology & Services segment backlog, which consists of commitments for (i) data processing work and (ii) both multi-client New Venture and proprietary projects that have been underwritten, had decreased to $21.9 million compared with $39.2 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in backlog is attributable to the timing of finalizing contracts. Our E&P Technology & Services segment’s fiscal year-end backlog includes signed contracts that we can usually fulfill within approximately six months. Investments in our multi-client data library are dependent upon the timing of our New Venture projects and the availability of underwriting by our customers. Our asset light strategy enables us to scale our business to avoid significant fixed costs and to remain financially flexible as we manage the timing and levels of our capital expenditures. 
E&P Advisors —  Our E&P Advisors group partners with E&P operators, energy industry regulators and capital institutions to capture and monetize E&P opportunities worldwide. This group provides technical, commercial and strategic advice across the exploration and production value chain, working at basin, prospect and field scales. E&P Advisors couples ION’s proven technical capabilities with the industry’s best commercial and strategic minds to deliver fit-for-purpose solutions, employing a variety of commercial models specific to our clients’ needs. 
Operations Optimization Segment
9


Our Operations Optimization segment combines our Optimization Software & Services and Devices offerings.
Through this segment, we supply command and control software systems and related services for marine towed streamer and ocean bottom seismic operations. Software developed by our Optimizations Software & Services group is installed on marine towed streamer vessels and used by many ocean bottom survey crews. In addition, we recently began selling existing technology to new customers in scientific, military and academic industries. An advantage of our underlying software platform is that it provides common components from which to build other applications. This enables the acceleration of development and commercialization of new products as market opportunities are identified. Marlin, our newest software solution for optimizing offshore operations is an example where we leveraged the underlying software platform to quickly develop a new offering.
Products and services for our Optimizations Software & Services group include the following:
Towed Streamer Command & Control System — Our command and control software for towed streamer acquisition, Orca, integrates acquisition, planning, positioning, source and quality control systems into a seamless operation.
 Ocean Bottom Command & Control System — Gator is our integrated navigation and data management system for multi-vessel OBS, electromagnetic and transition zone operations.
Survey Planning and Optimization — We offer consulting services for planning and supervising complex surveys, including for 4-D (time lapse) and wide-azimuth survey operations. Our acquisition expertise and in-field software platforms are designed to allow clients, including both E&P companies and seismic data acquisition contractors, to optimize these complex surveys, improving efficiencies, data quality and reducing costs. Our Orca and Gator systems are designed to integrate with our post-survey tools for processing, analysis and data quality control. Orca and Gator both have modules that enable in-field survey optimization. These modules are designed to enable improved, safer acquisition through analysis and prediction of sea currents and integration of the information into the acquisition plan. 
Optimization Software — Marlin is a cloud-based software designed to maximize the safety and efficiency of complex offshore operations by automatically integrating a variety of data sources in real-time with operational plans to improve situational awareness and decision making. Akin to air traffic control systems, Marlin enables multiple stakeholders to share and visualize vessel route plans, foresee and avoid conflicts between vessels and fixed assets, optimize schedules safely within a rules-based environment, and measure and improve asset performance.
Products of our Devices group include the following:
Marine Positioning Systems — Our marine towed streamer positioning system includes streamer cable depth control devices, lateral control devices, compasses, acoustic positioning systems and other auxiliary sensors. This equipment is designed to control the vertical and horizontal positioning of the streamer cables and provides acoustic, compass and depth measurements to allow processors to tie navigation and location data to geophysical data to determine the location of potential hydrocarbon reserves. DigiBIRD II™ is designed to maintain streamers at pre-defined target depths more safely, efficiently, and cost effectively than ever before by eliminating workboat operations for battery changes on the majority of seismic surveys. DigiFIN® is an advanced lateral streamer control system that we commercialized in 2008. DigiFIN® is designed to maintain tighter, more uniform marine streamer separation along the entire length of the streamer cable, which allows for better sampling of seismic data and improved subsurface images. We believe DigiFIN® also enables faster line changes and minimizes the requirements for in-fill seismic work. In addition to manufacturing new marine positioning system devices, the Devices group also repairs its positioning equipment previously sold to its customers.
Analog Geophones — Analog geophones are sensors that measure acoustic energy reflected from rock layers in the Earth’s subsurface using a mechanical, coil-spring element. We manufacture and market a full suite of geophones and geophone test equipment that operate in most environments, including land surface, transition zone and downhole. Our geophones are used in other industries as well.
Ocean Bottom Integrated Technologies Segment
ION offers a fully-integrated OBS solution that includes expert survey design, planning and optimization, to maximize seismic image quality; safe, efficient data acquisition; superior imaging; and data processing, interpretation and reservoir services. 
10


We believe the market for ocean bottom seismic imaging is growing. OBS provides more detailed reservoir imaging typically used for development rather than exploration objectives, leading E&P companies to prioritize in ocean bottom seismic activities, consistent with their desire for higher-quality seismic imaging for complex geological formations and more detailed reservoir characteristics. Since introducing our first ocean bottom acquisition system, VSO, in 2004, we have continued to develop advanced ocean bottom systems and continue to evolve our strategy which now includes licensing of our 4Sea™ technology making it available more broadly to all OBS service providers on a value-based pricing model. Such licensing will be recognized through the relevant segment, either E&P Technology & Services or Operations Optimization. This change in strategy resulted in a write down of $36.6 million for our cable-based ocean bottom acquisition technologies.
INOVA Geophysical Products
INOVA manufactures land acquisition systems, including the G3i® HD, ARIES® and Hawk® recording platforms, land source products, including the AHV-IV series, UNIVIB®, and UNIVIB 2 vibroseis vehicles, and source controllers and multicomponent sensors, including the VectorSeis® digital 3C receivers. 
Product Research and Development
Our ability to compete effectively in the seismic market depends principally upon continued innovation in our underlying technologies. As such, the overall focus of our research and development efforts has remained on improving both the quality of the subsurface images we generate and the economics, efficiency and quality of the seismic data. In particular, we have concentrated on enhancing the nature and quality of the information that can be extracted from the subsurface images.
Research and development efforts in 2018 targeted the consolidation of key technologies across ION, together with the expansion of our portfolio of product offerings. A range of new technologies have been developed, including new and flexible seismic acquisition optimization and processing tools, in-water control devices which improve the operational efficiency of marine sources and the next generation ocean bottom nodal system.
The Optimization Software & Services group continued development of survey optimization and integration capabilities across the software portfolio as well as with products from the Devices group. Investment continued in the Marlin simultaneous operations tool including the aim of addressing alternative market opportunities.
Development within the Devices group was focused on the new in-water control device, SailWing™, including sea trials and integration with the Orca and Gator software products, as well as further development of the successful Digi family of products, including the automatic Streamer Recovery Device and rechargeable battery option. We continue to invest in the development of new sensors with applicability both within and outside the seismic business.
The Imaging Services group continued to invest in production efficiencies, leading-edge technologies and OBS capabilities. Research continued into advanced imaging techniques such as the extension of FWI to allow the use of reflection data as well as high-frequency FWI.
As many of these new services and products are under development and, as the development cycles from initial conception through to commercial introduction can extend over a number of years, their commercial feasibility or degree of commercial acceptance may not yet be established. No assurance can be given concerning the successful development of any new service or product, any enhancements to them, the specific timing of their release or their level of acceptance in the marketplace.

Our primary customers are E&P companies to whom we market and offer services, primarily multi-client seismic data programs from our Ventures group, imaging-related processing services from our Imaging Services group, as well as consulting services from our E&P Advisors and Optimization Software & Services group. In 2018, E&P companies accounted for approximately 77% of our total consolidated net revenues. Secondarily, seismic contractors purchase our towed streamer data acquisition systems and related equipment and software to collect data in accordance with their E&P company customers’ specifications or for their own seismic data libraries. 
A significant portion of our marketing effort is focused on areas outside of the United States. Foreign sales are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States, including the risk of political instability, armed conflict, civil disturbances, currency fluctuations, embargo and governmental activities, customer credit risks and risk of non-compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, including tariff regulations and import/export restrictions.
We sell our services and products through a direct sales force consisting of employees and international third-party sales representatives responsible for key geographic areas. The majority of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, sales to destinations outside of North America accounted for approximately 75%, 76% and 78% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. Further, systems and equipment sold to domestic customers are frequently deployed internationally and, from time to time, certain foreign sales require export licenses.

Traditionally, our business has been seasonal, with strongest demand typically in the second half of our fiscal year.
For information concerning the geographic breakdown of our consolidated net revenues, see Footnote 2 “Segment and Geographic Information” of Footnotes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Competition
Our Ventures group within our E&P Technology & Services segment faces competition in creating, developing and selling multi-client data libraries from a number of companies.  CGG (an integrated geophysical company) and Schlumberger (a large integrated oilfield services company) are shifting to an asset light strategy, joining TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company ASA and Spectrum ASA.  PGS and Polarcus run acquisition crews and also compete in multi-client data acquisition.  BGP operates in this space by primarily partnering with the aforementioned competitors to develop and sell multi-client data.  
Our Imaging Services group within our E&P Technology & Services segment competes with companies that provide data processing services to E&P companies. See “Services and Products - E&P Technology & Services Segment.” While the barriers to enter this market are relatively low, we believe the barriers to compete at the higher end of the market - the advanced pre-stack depth migration market where our efforts are focused - are significantly higher. At the higher end of this market, CGG and Schlumberger are our two primary competitors for advanced imaging services.  Both of these companies are significantly larger than ION in terms of revenue, processing locations and sales, marketing and financial resources.
In the OBS market, we compete with a number of companies, including Magseis Fairfield, Seabed Geosolutions (a joint venture of Fugro and CGG), and BGP. The OBS market primarily addresses the production end of the E&P business. This market is primarily vertically integrated with a variety of proprietary technologies, comprising both cable and nodal systems. Most companies operate one to three crews, and there have been four new entrants in the last few years. 
The market for seismic services and products is highly competitive and characterized by frequent changes in technology. Our principal competitor for marine seismic equipment is Sercel (a manufacturing subsidiary of CGG). Sercel has the advantage of being able to sell its products and services to its parent company that operates both land and marine crews, providing it with a significant and stable internal market and a greater ability to test new technology in the field. The recent downturn in the industry has disrupted traditional buying patterns. We have seen a generally increasing trend of companies such as Petroleum GeoServices ASA (“PGS”) developing their own instrumentation to create a competitive advantage through products such as GeoStreamer. We also compete with other seismic equipment companies on a product-by-product basis. Our ability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of seismic instruments and data acquisition systems depends principally upon continued technological innovation, as well as pricing, system reliability, reputation for quality and ability to deliver on schedule. 
Some seismic contractors design, engineer and manufacture seismic acquisition technology in-house (or through a network of third-party vendors) to differentiate themselves. Although this technology competes directly with our towed streamer, and ocean bottom equipment, it is not usually made available to other seismic acquisition contractors. However, the risk exists that other seismic contractors may decide to develop their own seismic technology, which would put additional pressure on the demand for our acquisition equipment. 
In addition, we expect reductions in the market for spare parts and service of existing equipment as a result of the fleet reductions currently occurring in the marine seismic market. CGG and WesternGeco, who traditionally had large fleet market shares, have both announced their intention to move to an asset light business model.
In the land seismic equipment market, where INOVA competes, the principal competitors are Sercel and Geospace Technologies. INOVA is a joint venture with BGP as a majority stake owner. BGP purchases land seismic equipment from both INOVA and competing land equipment suppliers.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies. We have approximately 500 patents and pending patent applications, including filings in international jurisdictions with respect to the same kinds of technologies. Although our portfolio of patents is considered important to our operations, and particular patents may be material to specific business lines, no one patent is considered essential to our consolidated business operations.
12


Our patents, copyrights and trademarks offer us only limited protection. Our competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, or may design around the proprietary features of our products. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult, and we may be unable to determine the extent to which such use occurs. Our difficulties are compounded in certain foreign countries where the laws do not offer as much protection for proprietary rights as the laws of the United States, including the potential for adverse decisions by judicial or administrative bodies in foreign countries with unpredictable or corrupt judicial systems. From time to time, third parties inquire and claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights and we make similar inquiries and claims to third parties. Material intellectual property litigation is discussed in detail in Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.”
The information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains references to trademarks, service marks and registered marks of ION and our subsidiaries, as indicated. Except where stated otherwise or unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “VectorSeis,” “ARIES II,” “DigiFIN,” “DigiCOURSE,” “Hawk,” “Orca,” “G3i,” “WiBand,”,“UNIVIB”, “VectorSeis” and “MESA” refer to the VECTORSEIS®, ARIES® II, DigiFIN®, DigiCOURSE®, HAWK®, ORCA®, G3I®, WiBand®, UNIVIB®, VectorSeis® and MESA® registered marks owned by ION or INOVA Geophysical or their affiliates, and the terms “BasinSPAN,” “Calypso,” “DigiSTREAMER,” “Gator,” “AHV-IV,” “Vib Pro,” “Shot Pro,” “Optimiser,” “Reflex,” “ResSCAN,” “PrecisION”, “SailWing”, “Marlin” and “4Sea,” refer to the BasinSPAN™, Calypso™, DigiSTREAMER™, GATOR™, AHV-IV™, Vib Pro™, Shot Pro™, Optimiser™, Reflex™, ResSCAN™, PrecisION™, SailWing™, Marlin™ and 4Sea™ trademarks and service marks owned by ION or INOVA Geophysical or their affiliates.
Regulatory Matters
Our operations are subject to various international conventions, laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the importation of and operation of seismic equipment, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and gas exploration and development, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel, environmental protection, the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of equipment. Our operations are subject to government policies and product certification requirements worldwide. Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating the companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and gas companies and may continue to do so. Operations in less developed countries can be subject to legal systems that are not as mature or predictable as those in more developed countries, which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings (including the potential for adverse decisions by judicial or administrative bodies in foreign countries with unpredictable or corrupt judicial systems). We are required to consent to home country jurisdiction in many of our contracts with foreign state-owned companies, particularly those countries where our data are acquired. 
Changes in these conventions, regulations, policies or requirements could affect the demand for our services and products or result in the need to modify them, which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. Our export activities are subject to extensive and evolving trade regulations. Certain countries are subject to trade restrictions, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. government. These restrictions and sanctions prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries.
Our operations are also subject to numerous local, state and federal laws and regulations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials, the remediation of contaminated properties and the protection of the environment. While the industry has experienced an increase in general environmental regulation worldwide and laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent, we do not believe compliance with these regulations has resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations, and we do not currently foresee the need for significant expenditures in order to be able to remain compliant in all material respects with current environmental protection laws. Regulations in this area are subject to change, and there can be no assurance that future laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
Our customers’ operations are also significantly impacted in other respects by laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and endangered species. For instance, many of our marine contractors have been affected by regulations protecting marine mammals in the Gulf of Mexico. To the extent that our customers’ operations are disrupted by future laws and regulations, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 496 regular, full-time employees, 292 of whom were located in the U.S. From time to time and on an as-needed basis, we supplement our regular workforce with individuals that we hire temporarily or retain as independent contractors in order to meet certain internal manufacturing or other business needs. Our U.S. employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
