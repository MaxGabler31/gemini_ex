Overview
 
Overview of Business
 
BioTime is a clinical-stage biotechnology company targeting degenerative diseases. Our programs are based on two core proprietary technology platforms: cell replacement and cell/drug delivery. With our cell replacement platform, we are creating new cells and tissues with our pluripotent and progenitor cell technologies. These cells and tissues are developed to replace those that are either rendered dysfunctional or lost due to degenerative diseases. Our cell/drug delivery programs are based upon our proprietary HyStem® cell and drug delivery matrix technology. HyStem® was designed to provide for the transfer, retention, engraftment and metabolic support of cellular replacement therapy.
 
Our lead cell replacement clinical program is OpRegen®, a retinal pigment epithelium cell replacement therapy, is in a Phase I/IIa, multicenter trial for the treatment of late-stage, dry age-related macular degeneration (dry-AMD). There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for dry-AMD, which accounts for approximately 90% of all age-related macular degeneration cases, and is the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 60.
 
Our lead cell delivery clinical program is Renevia®, which met its primary endpoint in a European pivotal clinical trial in patients with HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy. On March 13, 2018 we submitted a design dossier for EU market clearance (CE Mark) for the use of Renevia® as a device to aid in transferring a patient’s own adipose tissue to treat certain forms of facial lipoatrophy, or fat loss. We believe this European CE Mark submission is a gateway to the much larger, multi-billion dollar market opportunity of cosmetic facial aesthetics.
 
BioTime's research has created numerous promising technologies. We are creating value for shareholders by developing some of these technologies ourselves through our clinical development programs, while also unlocking the value of others through partnering and strategic transactions. As a result, we have significant equity holdings in two publicly-traded companies, Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (“Asterias”) and OncoCyte Corporation (“OncoCyte”), which we founded and which, until recently, were our majority-owned, consolidated subsidiaries. Asterias (NYSE American: AST) is presently focused on advancing three clinical-stage programs that have the potential to address areas of very high, unmet medical need in the fields of neurology (spinal cord injury) and oncology (acute myeloid leukemia and lung cancer). OncoCyte (NYSE American: OCX) is developing confirmatory diagnostic tests for lung cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer utilizing novel liquid biopsy technology. The combined market value of BioTime’s holdings in Asterias and OncoCyte was approximately $95.2 million as of February 28, 2018.
 
We also have a new majority-owned subsidiary, AgeX Therapeutics, Inc. (“AgeX”), which we formed in 2017 to continue development of early-stage programs focusing on the development of technology relating to cell immortality, regenerative biology, and aging and age-related diseases. AgeX’s initial programs focus on utilizing brown adipose tissue in targeting diabetes, obesity, and heart disease; and induced tissue regeneration (“iTR”) in utilizing the human body’s own abilities to scarlessly regenerate tissues damaged from age or trauma. AgeX has raised more than $10.7 million in equity funding from institutional and private investors, which has allowed BioTime to focus its resources on its clinical programs in its core therapeutic sectors. On August 2, 2017, AgeX initially raised approximately $10.0 million from the sale of its common stock at a price of $2.00 per share. BioTime continues to hold 28.8 million shares of AgeX. Our management and Board of Directors are exploring a number of options for having AgeX become a publicly-traded company, including a potential tax-free pro rata distribution of all AgeX shares to BioTime shareholders.
 
The technologies being developed by BioTime, our affiliates and our subsidiaries have the potential to significantly improve the treatment of degenerative diseases, which affect large numbers of people. We and our affiliates currently have multiple product candidates in human clinical trials: one met its primary endpoint in a pivotal study in Europe and could be approved by the end of this year, one is a blood test to help diagnose lung cancer, one may be helping spinal cord injury victims regain full or partial use of their hands and one may be the first treatment for the leading cause of blindness in people over 60. We also have several other promising programs that may help to address some of the biggest unmet medical needs faced by the world's aging population.
 
BioTime is incorporated in the State of California. Our common shares trade on the NYSE American and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange under the symbol “BTX.” Our principal executive offices are located at 1010 Atlantic Avenue, Suite 102, Alameda, CA 94501, and our phone number at that address is (510) 521-3390. Our website address is www.biotime.com. The information on, or that can be accessed through our website is not part of this Report.

Overview of Product Candidates Being Developed by BioTime
 
Pipeline
 
Our clinical programs are based on two proprietary, core technology platforms: cell/drug delivery and cell replacement.
 
The near-term clinical development focus for our two lead clinical programs is in two therapeutic fields: Aesthetics and Ophthalmology.
 

Cell Replacement:
 
Ophthalmology:
 
OpRegen®
 
OpRegen® is our lead ophthalmic product for the treatment of the dry form of age-related macular degeneration. It is a suspension of terminally differentiated retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that are derived from pluripotent cells. RPE cells form the back lining of the retina and support the function of photoreceptors (rods and cones). RPE cells can be damaged and lost in various forms of retinal degeneration. The OpRegen® therapeutic approach is to replace damaged or lost RPE cells with the goals of slowing disease progression in order to preserve vision, and/or restore visual function. OpRegen® is currently in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for the treatment of late-stage dry-AMD. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects more than 30 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 60. Approximately 90 percent of AMD patients suffer from the dry form, also referred to as dry-AMD, for which there is no therapy approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This program is currently being conducted by our 98.8% owned subsidiary Cell Cure Neurosciences, Ltd. (“Cell Cure”). Further references to this program may be described as being conducted by BioTime. More detail on OpRegen® and the trial data to date can be found below under THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT CANDIDATES BEING DEVELOPED BY BIOTIME – Cell Replacement – Ophthalmology—”OpRegen®.”
 
Retinal restoration 
 
In 2017, we expanded our ophthalmology portfolio through the acquisition of exclusive global rights to technology that allows the generation of three-dimensional human retinal tissue derived from human pluripotent cells. This tissue contains all the cell types and layers of the human retina and has shown evidence of functional integration in proof of concept animal models for advanced retinal degeneration. The technology is being developed to potentially treat or prevent a variety of retinal degenerative diseases and injuries. In 2017, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded us a grant of up to $1.56 million to further develop this innovative, next generation vision restoration program for retinal diseases and injuries, which severely impact the quality of life for millions of people who have limited treatment options.

Cell/Drug Delivery:
 
Aesthetics:
 
Renevia®
 
Renevia®, our lead facial aesthetics product, is being developed as a potential treatment for facial lipoatrophy. “Lipoatrophy” means the loss of fat tissue which may be caused by several factors, including trauma, aging or drug side effects such as those that cause HIV-associated lipoatrophy. Renevia® consists of our proprietary cell and drug delivery matrix (HyStem®) combined with the patient’s own fat or adipose progenitor cells. As a potential alternative to traditional fat transfer procedures, Renevia® is designed to mimic the naturally-occurring extracellular matrix in the body and provide a 3-D scaffold that supports effective cell transplant, retention, engraftment and metabolic support. Renevia® is being developed with the goal of providing a natural looking and feeling, long-lasting option for facial volume restoration. Additional information about HyStem® can be found below under TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS — HyStem® Delivery Technology.
 
In 2017 Renevia® met the primary endpoint of implanted volume retention in a pivotal clinical trial in Europe to assess its safety and efficacy in restoring facial volume in patients whose subcutaneous fat, or adipose tissue, has been lost due to a side effect of certain drugs used to treat some patients with HIV. Based on these clinical trial results, on March 13, 2018 we filed for marketing authorization in the European Union (EU) for certain forms of facial lipoatrophy. We anticipate approval later this year. For more detail on Renevia® and the trial data to date, please see THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT CANDIDATES BEING DEVELOPED BY BIOTIME — Cell/Drug Delivery – Aesthetics – “Renevia®”, below.
 
We view our European clinical trials of Renevia® as being supportive of the U.S. development of Renevia®, for treating facial lipoatrophy, whether from drugs, trauma or aging. A U.S. investigator-led trial of Premvia™ began in late 2017 for use in the treatment of age-related facial lipoatrophy. Premvia™ has the same composition as Renevia®. Results of this investigator-led trial are expected later this year. A company sponsored exploratory study of Renevia® for use in treating age-related facial atrophy is expected to commence in Europe later this year. Premvia™, is a HyStem® hydrogel formulation that has already received FDA 510(k) clearance for the management of wounds, including partial and full-thickness wounds, ulcers, tunneled/undermined wounds, surgical wounds, and burns.
 
Other Cell/Drug Delivery:
 
We are also developing HyStem® for the delivery of therapeutic drugs and cells to localized areas of the body, including for sustained drug release in the targeted area.
 
ReGlyde™
 
ReGlyde™ is another HyStem® product in preclinical development as a device for viscosupplementation and as a platform for intraarticular drug delivery in osteoarthritis (OA). The viscosupplementation device program aims to administer ReGlyde™ directly into OA affected joints to provide joint lubrication to reduce pain and improve quality of life. The drug delivery program seeks to enable the sustained release of therapeutics in affected OA joints to help slow or reverse disease progression, in addition to alleviating pain and improving joint function.
 
Products for Orthopedic Indications
 
We are developing a bone grafting product under a research and development agreement and a licensing agreement with Heraeus Medical GmbH. The goal of this program is to develop innovative bone grafting products that could potentially address difficult to heal or compromised bone fractures based on the use of our proprietary PureStem® progenitor cell technology. This program is currently being conducted by our 99.8% owned subsidiary OrthoCyte Corporation (“OrthoCyte”), as such, further herein, references to this project may be described as being conducted by BioTime.

Products Enhancements
 
As part of our therapeutic and delivery program, we are also developing HyStem® product enhancements, including a frozen liquid product format, which, if successful, will make HyStem® products significantly easier for physicians to administer.
Overview of Product Candidates of Public Affiliates
 
Asterias is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to developing cell-based therapeutics to treat neurological conditions associated with demyelination and cellular immunotherapies to treat cancer. OncoCyte is developing confirmatory diagnostic tests for lung cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer utilizing novel liquid biopsy technology. The combined market value of BioTime’s holdings in Asterias and OncoCyte was approximately $95.2 million as of February 28, 2018.
Therapeutic Products in Neurology and Oncology
 
Asterias currently has three clinical programs:
 

● | AST-OPC1 is an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell population derived from pluripotent stem cells that is currently in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for spinal cord injuries (“SCI”) that has been partially funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | AST-VAC2 is a non-patient-specific (“off-the-shelf”) cancer immunotherapy derived from pluripotent stem cells for which a clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer is being funded and sponsored by Cancer Research UK, the world’s largest independent cancer research charity; and

Liquid Biopsies for Diagnosis of Cancer
 
Our affiliate OncoCyte is focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative, biopsy tests that improve diagnosis and reduce healthcare costs for some of the most common and deadly cancers. They are developing confirmatory diagnostic tests for areas of high unmet need including lung cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer utilizing novel liquid biopsy technology. While current biopsy tests use invasive surgical procedures to provide tissue samples to determine if a tumor is benign or malignant, OncoCyte is developing a next generation of diagnostic tests that will be based on liquid biopsies using blood or urine samples.
 
Overview of AgeX Product Candidates
 
AgeX is applying technology relating to cellular immortality and regenerative biology to aging and age-related diseases. AgeX has three initial areas of product development:
 

● | AGEX-BAT1 consists of pluripotent stem cell-derived brown adipocytes is initially planned to be developed as a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | AGEX-VASC1 consists of vascular progenitors that will be targeting cardiac ischemia; and 
● | iTR (induced Tissue Regeneration), which is being designed as a systemic therapy for inducing the scarless regeneration of tissues. 

Strategy
 
As we transition into a clinical and commercial-ready company, our near-term focus continues to be on three primary objectives: Clinical Progress, Simplification and Unlocking Value.
 
Clinical Progress
 
Our efforts are focused on progressing our therapeutic products through clinical development. Our organizational capabilities are being aligned to execute on this objective to better position us to design, execute and oversee trials, with the goal of generating significant value-creating data in the near-term, and enabling future commercialization of our product candidates. Clinical progress success will allow the company to create greater value for our shareholders, as well as allow us to better resource several other programs that are based on our core technologies.

Simplification
 
Because our research created numerous promising technologies that we developed in part through a range of subsidiaries and partnership relationships, BioTime's structure became complex over time. Over the last two years we have focused on simplification. We will continue to work on simplifying our corporate, financial and organizational structure to allow us to execute our objectives more efficiently, while also making it much easier for shareholders and potential investors to better understand our company.
Unlocking Value
 
Our purpose is to deliver therapies to patients with significant unmet, or under-met, needs, while creating value for our investors. BioTime’s research has created numerous valuable technologies. We are creating value for shareholders by developing some of these technologies ourselves through our clinical development programs while unlocking the value of others through the execution of various strategies, including partnering, sale of non-core assets, creation of companies, spinoffs, and the implementation of our simplification plans. We expect to continue to do so when we deem it in the best interest of our shareholders.
Technology Platforms
 
Cell Replacement Technology:
 

BioTime believes that it and its subsidiaries and affiliates have the world’s premier collection of pluripotent cell assets. Pluripotent cells, which we believe are capable of becoming any of the cell types of the human body, have potential applications in many areas of medicine with large unmet patient needs, including various age-related degenerative diseases and degenerative conditions for which there are presently no cures. Unlike pharmaceuticals that require a molecular target, therapeutic strategies based on the use of pluripotent cells are generally aimed at regenerating or replacing affected cells and tissues, and therefore, may have broader applicability than many pharmaceutical products. Pharmaceuticals and therapies that require systemic delivery into the body often have unexpected results, or side effects, that can limit the usefulness on the particular therapy. Many times, the side effects are so detrimental that the therapy cannot be approved. Cell replacement, on the other hand, is locally administered, so systemic side effects are not a primary concern in therapeutic development. The risk profile more closely resembles that of transplant medicine, focused more on whether the transplanted cells are rejected by the body and whether the cells do what they are expected to do. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
BioTime has two proprietary cell therapy platforms, PureStem® progenitor cells and pluripotent cell lines. PureStem® cells address significant challenges in regenerative medicine through their purity, proliferative capacity and ability to better predictably acquire tissue specificity or “differentiate,” into a broad spectrum of cell types in a simplified and controlled fashion. These advantages may allow the production, on a commercial scale, of pure cultures of potentially therapeutic cell types that do not contain uncharacterized “undifferentiated” cell types. The pluripotent cell lines derived under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions, are NIH-registered and are among the best-characterized and documented human stem cell lines available today, with donor medical history, adventitious agents testing, complete genome sequence, STR-fingerprint and HLA-type data available.

HyStem® Delivery Technology:
 

HyStem® is a patented biomaterial that mimics the extracellular matrix, the structural network of molecules surrounding cells in organs and tissues that is essential to cellular function and tissue integrity. Many tissue engineering and regenerative cell-based therapies will require the delivery of therapeutic cells in a matrix or scaffold for accurate anatomical delivery, cell retention and engraftment, guided tissue remodeling and proper function. HyStem® is a unique hydrogel that has been shown to support cellular attachment and proliferation in vivo. Current research at leading medical institutions has shown that HyStem® is compatible with a wide variety of cells and tissue types including brain, bone, skin, cartilage, vascular and heart tissues. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The patented technology underlying our HyStem® hydrogel products in development, such as Renevia®, Premvia® and ReGlyde™, was developed at the University of Utah and has been exclusively licensed to BioTime for human therapeutic uses. The HyStem® technology is based on a unique thiol cross-linking chemistry to prepare hyaluronan-based hydrogels. Since the first published report in 2002, there have been over 200 academic scientific publications supporting the biocompatibility of thiol cross-linked hyaluronan-based hydrogels and their applications as medical devices and in cell culture, tissue engineering, and animal models of cell-based therapies. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to the unique cross-linking chemistry, HyStem® hydrogels have the ability to mix cells and can be injected or applied as a gel which allows the hydrogel to conform to a cavity or space. This property of HyStem® hydrogels offers several distinct advantages over other hydrogels, including the possibility of combining bioactive materials with the hydrogel at the point of use. Building upon this platform, we are developing the HyStem® family of unique, biocompatible resorbable hydrogel products. 

Therapeutic Product Candidates Being Developed By BioTime
 
Cell Replacement
 
Ophthalmology
 
OpRegen®
 

Age-related macular degeneration, also known as “AMD”, is a gradual, progressive, deterioration of the macula, the small sensitive area in the center of the retina that provides clear central vision. Damage to the macula makes facial recognition, reading and driving difficult or impossible. There are two forms of AMD, the dry form and the wet form. The dry form, or “dry-AMD”, advances slowly toward geographic atrophy (GA) in which RPE cells and photoreceptors degenerate, or are lost. Once the atrophy involves the fovea (the center of the macula), patients lose their central vision and may develop into legal blindness. Its cause is unknown. It tends to progress more slowly than the wet type, and there is not an approved treatment or cure, other than nutritional supplements, which have shown limited efficacy in longer-term studies. 

 AMD affects more than 30 million people worldwide and approximately 1.6 million people are newly diagnosed annually in the U.S. It is the leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 60. Approximately 90 percent of AMD patients suffer from the dry form, for which there are no FDA approved medical therapies.
 
We believe one of the most promising future therapies for dry-AMD is the replacement of the layer of damaged RPE cells that support and nourish the retina.

Our lead ophthalmology product, OpRegen®, is a cell replacement therapy derived from our pluripotent cell technology. It is currently in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for the treatment of dry-AMD. OpRegen® is a proprietary formulation of RPE cells developed to be transplanted into the patient’s eye, where the patient’s own RPE cells are missing or compromised. OpRegen® consists of animal-free RPE cells with high purity and potency using a proprietary directed differentiated method. OpRegen® is formulated as a suspension of RPE cells and it was developed to address the significant unmet medical need of people suffering from dry aged-related macular degeneration. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies in rats have shown that following a single subretinal injection of OpRegen® as a suspension of cells, the cells rapidly organized into their natural monolayer structure and survive throughout the lifetime of the rat, which we believe is critical to the potential success of OpRegen® in humans.
 
OpRegen® is intended to be an allogeneic, “off-the-shelf,” product provided to retinal surgeons in an “easy-to-use” form for transplantation. Unlike other investigational treatments for dry-AMD, and currently-marketed treatments for wet-AMD (Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and Aflibercept (Eylea®)), that require multiple, frequent injections into the eye, we expect OpRegen® would potentially be administered in a single procedure, or once every several years.
 
The patients in our current Phase I/IIa study are or will be 50 years of age or older, whose dry-AMD has advanced to the GA stage, with absence of additional concomitant ocular disorders. The eye in which the disease has progressed the most will be treated, while the other eye will serve as a control. Following injection, the patients will be followed for 12 months at specified intervals, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OpRegen®. Currently there are four study sites in Israel and two sites in the U.S. Enrollment in the third cohort was completed in January 2018. Cohort 4 enrollment is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2018. The fourth cohort will also include patients with better vision and a wide range of preliminary functional assessments, such as best corrected visual acuity.
 
Following the initial 12-month period, patients will continue to be evaluated at longer intervals for up to an additional five years following injection. A secondary objective of the clinical trial will be to examine the ability of transplanted OpRegen® to engraft, survive, and modulate disease progression in the patients. In addition to thorough characterization of visual function, several vision tests will be used to quantify improvements in reducing the progression of the disease.
 
Interim data from the nine subjects, with large areas of GA treated in Cohorts 1-3, represent an initial review of this ongoing Phase I/IIa open-label study and suggest that RPE cells are generally well-tolerated when administered by subretinal injection. Findings using a variety of imaging modalities suggest presence of cells in the subretinal space, an observation that is consistent with, and supported by, the data from the preclinical studies of OpRegen®. The surgical procedures were generally well-tolerated, with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images showing absorption of the subretinal fluid in the bleb within less than 48 hours after surgery and healing of the site of retinal penetration by the cannula within a few weeks. Fundus findings on clinical examination and by different imaging modalities evolved over the first few weeks and months, then largely stabilized. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) has remained stable in both the treated and fellow eyes of these advanced AMD patients. Subretinal pigmentation that correlates with irregular subretinal hyperreflectance on SD-OCT have been observed, suggesting the presence of cells in the subretinal space. Though it is not definitively known at this time whether these changes represent engraftment and survival of the transplanted cells, data from the preclinical studies suggest this is the most likely scenario.
 
Importantly, in this safety-focused study, no unexpected ocular AEs have been observed and those events expected to occur based on the procedures involved in OpRegen® administration, such as vitrectomy, have been mild in severity. The majority of these subjects had pre-existing epiretinal membranes (ERMs) at the time of study enrollment and several have experienced new or worsening ERM following the surgical procedure and OpRegen® injection. These subjects are being monitored during study follow-up, however, none have required surgical intervention to date. The independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) has approved moving to the 4th Cohort based on the safety data from the first 3 cohorts. Cohort 4 will incorporate an additional variety of objective and subjective assessments to look for signs of potential efficacy as well as potential anatomical changes indicative of OpRegen® cell function following implantation.
 
We are currently actively enrolling additional subjects at a number of clinical trial sites in the United States and Israel. We currently have two active clinical trial sites the U.S. Both sites are headed by well-renowned physicians, David S. Boyer, MD of Retina-Vitreous Associates in Los Angeles and Dr. H. Richard McDonald of West Coast Retina Medical Group in San Francisco. We expect to open additional clinical trial sites in the U.S. later this year.

We have established an innovative cell therapy manufacturing facility located in the Jerusalem Bio Park on the campus of Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel. Our facility is equipped to produce OpRegen® and a range of other cell therapy products for human use in clinical trials as well as at a grade suitable for commercial use.
 
Retinal Restoration
 
We have acquired exclusive global rights to ophthalmology-related technology that was developed, in part, in collaboration with BioTime scientists, and includes composition and methodologies to develop 3-D retinal tissue constructs from pluripotent cells for implantation in patients with advanced stages of retinal degeneration.
 
This technology may allow generation of three-dimensional laminated human retinal tissue in a controlled manufacturing process. This could lead to retinal restoration treatments for a variety of advanced retinal degenerative diseases and ocular injuries, such as retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy.
 
In September 2017, BioTime was awarded a grant of up to $1.56 million from the Small Business Innovation Research program of the National Institutes of Health. The grant provides funding to further develop BioTime’s innovative, next generation vision restoration program for more advanced retinal diseases and injuries, which severely impact the quality of life for millions of people with no treatment option. This initiative aims at improving vision in people affected by blindness, whether caused by retinal injuries, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa or other causes.
 
Cell/Drug Delivery
 
Aesthetics
 
Renevia®
 

Renevia® consists of our proprietary cell-transplantation delivery matrix (HyStem®) combined with the patient’s own adipose progenitor cells from their own fat. We are developing Renevia® as an injectable product to address needs in facial aesthetic procedures, and potentially certain reconstructive surgeries, such as breast reconstruction after cystectomy or lumpectomy. Our goal is to improve the process of transplanting a patient’s own fat cells to potentially provide longer lasting volume, while maintaining a natural look and feel. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lipoatrophy is the loss of fat tissue which can be caused by several factors, including trauma, aging or drug side effects such as in HIV-associated lipoatrophy. Cells obtained from a patient, such as adipose progenitor cells obtained through liposuction, can be transplanted back into the same patient at another location in the body without the risk of potential rejection or transmission of diseases associated with the transplant of allogenic donor tissues. However, the transplantation of cells alone, without the molecular matrix in which cells normally reside, often leads to widespread cell death, or the failure of the transplanted cells to remain at the transplant site. The transfer of cells in Renevia® may resolve this issue by maintaining the transplanted cells at the intended site and by providing a three-dimensional scaffold upon which cells can attach and rebuild normal tissue. 

 
We conducted a multi-site pivotal clinical study in Europe to assess the efficacy of Renevia® as a delivery matrix for fat progenitor cells to restore skin volume in HIV patients whose subcutaneous adipose tissue has been lost as a side effect of their use of certain anti-retroviral drugs, like Stavudine and Zidovudine. The resulting facial wasting ages the individual’s appearance prematurely and, along with a thinning of the skin, allows musculature and vasculature to be easily seen. Treatment of the condition improves the individual’s self-esteem and quality of life.
 
Renevia® has met the primary endpoint of implanted volume retention in its pivotal European clinical trial. Based on these clinical trial results, we have filed for marketing authorization in the EU for certain forms of facial lipoatrophy. We anticipate approval later this year.

In the EU pivotal clinical trial, Renevia® treated patients retained approximately 100% of transplanted volume at six months (p<0.001), based on 3-D volume measurement of the implanted area, achieving the primary endpoint of the study (see Chart below). In addition to meeting the primary endpoint, treated patients retained an average 70% of the transplanted volume at 12 months and those patients that were observed after 18 months retained 64% of the transplanted volume. The data from additional patients at this time point are expected later this year. All Renevia® transplants were shown to be generally well tolerated and there were no device-related serious adverse events noted during this trial.
 
3-D Volume Measurement of the EU Pivotal Renevia Trial - Primary Endpoint (p<0.001)
 

In addition to serving as the basis for our European filing for marketing authorization, we also plan to use this trial to support initial safety findings for U.S. development of Renevia® for multiple forms of facial lipoatrophy.
 
The rapidly-growing global facial aesthetics market is estimated to be over $5 billion. Execution of our label expansion plans into this broader market has already begun with an investigator-led trial in the United States. In 2017, a U.S. investigator-led trial of our Premvia™ HyStem® product, which has 510 (k) clearance in the U.S. for wound management and is the same composition as Renevia®, was initiated to study the utility of Premvia™ for facial volume deficit in non-HIV patients. Although BioTime does not control execution of this trial, we expect preliminary data later this year. A company sponsored, exploratory study of Renevia® for cosmetic use is expected to commence in Europe later this year to study more broadly the utility of Renevia® for volume deficit in non-HIV patients.
 
BioTime plans to build upon this investigator-led trial and the EU pivotal trial data with additional studies, including an additional company-sponsored study in Europe and a pivotal trial in the U.S. We will continue our discussions with the FDA regarding a potential development pathway for Renevia® in the U.S. Renevia® is manufactured in the U.S. in compliance with cGMP requirements and has been tested pursuant to ISO 10993 standards for implantable medical devices.
 
Other Cell/Drug Delivery
 
ReGlyde™
 
ReGlyde™ is a proprietary formulation of the HyStem® hydrogel platform and is currently in preclinical development for viscosupplementation and drug delivery in osteoarthritis. Pre-clinical results are encouraging and have shown biocompatibility and preclinical efficacy signals in animal models.
 
Research and Development and License Agreements with Heraeus Medical GmbH
 
We are developing cellular therapeutics for orthopedic disorders with Heraeus Medical GmbH (“Heraeus”). The initial goal of this project is to develop innovative bone grafting therapies based on the use of our proprietary PureStem® human embryonic progenitor cell technology. Pursuant to the terms of our research and development agreement with Heraeus, BioTime is responsible for research and development of a cell-based bone grafting product using PureStem® technology and either HyStem® scaffold technology for delivery of bio-active components or scaffold technology owned by Heraeus or licensed to Heraeus from third parties.

AgeX Product Candidates
 
Brown Fat Technology for Treatment of Metabolic Disorders
 
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) cells, or as they are sometimes called “brown fat cells,” have only recently become the subject of intense study by medical researchers. Unlike normal white adipose tissue which is the fat we normally associate with obesity and disorders correlated with obesity such as Type II Diabetes (T2D), BAT cells don’t simply store calories. BAT cells burn calories in the process of generating body heat. In addition, the cells secrete biologically-active molecules that are believed to play an important role in maintaining the body in a state of metabolic health. Recently it has also been reported that humans lose BAT as a function of age and the loss of these cells are implicated in unhealthy age-related changes in metabolism such as obesity, T2D, and metabolic syndrome. This recent discovery may have important consequences for regenerative medicine, since pluripotent cells provide a means of manufacturing all human cell types on an industrial scale, including BAT cells. AgeX’s research team has invented a technology to manufacture BAT cells and filed certain patent applications that it believes provides it with a path to develop BAT cells for the potentially large and growing markets associated with obesity, T2D, and cardiovascular disease. Prior to initiating human clinical trials, AgeX will be required to successfully perform extensive preclinical testing of the cells to determine their safety and efficacy in non-human model systems.
Treatment of Vascular Disorders
 
AgeX is using vascular cells derived from pluripotent stem cells, and other technologies, to develop treatments for vascular disorders. The therapeutic indications AgeX is targeting include age-related cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral artery disease. Therapeutics for age-related vascular disease represent some of the largest, fastest-growing actual and potential markets in the U.S. due to the aging baby boom generation. Cardiovascular disease is among the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S., and consumes a major and ever-increasing proportion of health care costs. The National Academy of Sciences has estimated that a potential 58 million Americans are currently afflicted with cardiovascular disease. AgeX is using technology for the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into vascular endothelial cells in combination with the PureStem® technology to produce highly purified monoclonal embryonic vascular endothelial progenitor stem cells.
 
iTR
 
When tissues in the human body are damaged as a result of degenerative disease, injury, or surgery, there is generally a very limited capacity of the body to regenerate the tissue back to its original state. Exceptions to this rule are blood and the liver, both of which both show a remarkable capacity to restore equilibrium after the loss of cells. Other exceptions are tissues in the human body when it is first being formed. Early in development tissues such as the skin can repair itself scarlessly, but this ability is lost even before we are born. Another example in the animal kingdom is the Mexican salamander which shows a profound capacity to regenerate damaged tissues, even restoring severed limbs. However, in the adult human, most tissues simply scar rather than regenerate. AgeX’s scientists have been performing certain research to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating this loss of regenerative potential after the human body is formed based on its expertise in pluripotent stem cell technology. As a result, these scientists have invented a novel technology called “induced Tissue Regeneration” or “iTR.” iTR is designed to eventually facilitate the identification of therapies to induce scarless regeneration of tissues in the body that currently cannot naturally repair themselves. Examples of potential applications are numerous, but AgeX plans to initially focus on the regeneration of the heart following infection or heart failure, and scarless skin regeneration. iTR is a revolutionary new approach to medicine.
 
Product Candidates of Public Affiliates Asterias Biotherapeutics and OncoCyte
 
Therapeutic Products in Neurology and Oncology
 
Asterias currently has three clinical-stage programs which have the potential to address areas of very high unmet medical need in the fields of neurology and oncology.
AST-OPC1 Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells for Spinal Cord Injury and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases
 
AST-OPC1 is an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell population. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are cells that become oligodendrocytes after injection. It has been shown preclinically to have three potentially reparative functions that address the complex pathologies observed at the injury site of a spinal cord injury. These activities of AST-OPC1 include production of neurotrophic factors, stimulation of vascularization, and induction of remyelination of denuded axons, all of which are critical for survival, regrowth and conduction of nerve impulses through axons at the injury site.

AST-OPC1 was tested in patients with acute spinal cord injury in a Phase I trial and is being tested in a Phase I/IIa dose escalation (“SCIStar study”) trial. Asterias completed enrollment of the entire SCiStar study in December 2017. Asterias has enrolled a total of 25 subjects in the SCiStar study, plus five subjects from the previous Phase 1 safety trial. In October 2017, Asterias reported 12-month data from the SCiStar study’s Cohort 2 (AIS-A 10 million-cell cohort), which included six subjects. At 12 months, 67% (4 out of 6) of Cohort two subjects recovered two or more motor levels on at least one side, exceeding the company’s 12-month target of 45-50% of subjects achieving this level of improvement. In February 2018, Asterias provided a clinical trial update that highlighted the following:
 

● | Positive Safety Profile - Asterias has dosed 25 subjects with AST-OPC1 in the SCiStar study and a total of 30 subjects including the five subjects from the previous Phase 1 safety trial who have been followed for as long as seven years. As of the update, there have been no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the AST-OPC1 cells. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cell Engraftment - Together with the previously reported results from Cohort 2, the MRI results-to-date for 94% (17/18) of the Cohort 2-4 subjects provide supportive evidence that AST-OPC1 cells have durably engrafted at the injury site and helped to prevent cavitation. Cohort 3 consists of subjects with AIS-A injuries that were administered 20 million AST-OPC1 cells and Cohort 4 consists of subjects with AIS-B injuries that were administered 10 million AST-OPC1 cells. 
● | Improved Motor Function - At six months, 83% (15/18) of Cohort 2-4 subjects recovered at least 1 motor level on at least one side and 22% (4/18) of Cohort 2-4 subjects recovered two or more motor levels on at least one side. 

 
Asterias will have various SCiStar study data readouts in 2018.
 
There are approximately 17,000 new spinal cord injuries annually (NSCIC SCI Facts and Figures at a Glance (2016)). There are currently no drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) specifically for the treatment of spinal cord injury. As of 2016, the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center reported that approximately 4,500 of these new spinal cord injuries annually in the U. S. are AIS-A, AIS-B, or AIS-C patients with C-4 to C-7 spinal cord injuries (https://www.nscisc.uab.edu/).
 
The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation of AST-OPC1 and designated AST-OPC1 a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy for the treatment of acute SCI.
 
AST-VAC1: Autologous Telomerase-loaded Dendritic Cells
 
AST-VAC1 is an Asterias autologous (patient-specific) cancer vaccine designed to stimulate a patient’s immune system to attack telomerase. Asterias is developing AST-VAC1 for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (“AML”), the most common form of acute leukemia in adults. A Phase II clinical trial of AST-VAC1 was conducted and demonstrated that AST-VAC1 was successfully manufactured and released in 24 out of the 33 patients enrolled in the study. Twenty-one patients received AST-VAC1 in the study, including 19 in clinical remission and two in early relapse. AST-VAC1 was found to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Asterias has performed follow-up data collection on the 19 patients who were treated while in complete remission to determine the long-term effects of the AST-VAC1 administration on remission duration and disease-free survival. The results of this data collection were reported in an oral presentation in May 2015. Eleven of 19 patients (58%) remained in complete remission at a median follow-up of 52 months. These results compare to historical data suggesting that between 20-40% of patients would be expected to be relapse free at 3-4 years. Additionally, of the 7 patients in the higher risk over 60-year-old group, 4 (57%) remained relapse free at a median follow up of 54 months. Historically, relapse free survival rates in this population have been 10-20% at 3-4 years. Asterias has conducted an End of Phase II meeting with the FDA with the goal of reviewing the proposed clinical development plan for AST-VAC1.
 
The next major step in clinical development for AST-VAC1 would be to conduct a confirmatory Phase 2b study in higher risk patients over 60 years old.
 
AST-VAC2: hES Cell-Derived Allogeneic Dendritic Cells
 
AST-VAC2 is being developed by Asterias as an allogeneic, or non-patient specific, cancer vaccine candidate designed to stimulate patient immune responses to telomerase. AST-VAC2 is produced from human embryonic stem (“hES’) cells that can be modified with any antigen. In September 2014, Asterias entered into a Clinical Trial and Option Agreement (the “CRUK Agreement”) with Cancer Research UK (“CRUK”) and Cancer Research Technology Limited, (“CRT”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CRUK, pursuant to which CRUK has agreed to fund Phase I/II clinical development of AST-VAC2 loaded with the same LAMP-telomerase construct used in AST-VAC1. Under the terms of the CRUK Agreement, Asterias is responsible, at their own cost, for completing process development and manufacturing scale-up of the AST-VAC2 manufacturing process and transferring the resulting cGMP-compatible process to CRUK. CRUK is responsible, at its own cost, for manufacturing clinical grade AST-VAC2 and for carrying out the Phase I/II clinical trial of AST-VAC2. The Asterias technology transfer to CRUK has been completed and CRUK has received the necessary regulatory approvals to initiate the first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial of AST-VAC2 in the United Kingdom. Patient enrollment for this study is expected to begin in 2018.

Liquid Biopsies for Cancer Diagnostics
 
OncoCyte is developing diagnostic tests for lung cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer utilizing novel liquid biopsy technology. While current biopsy tests use invasive surgical procedures to provide tissue samples to determine if a tumor is benign or malignant, OncoCyte is developing highly accurate, easy to administer, non-invasive molecular diagnostic tests that will be based on liquid biopsies using blood or urine samples.
Clinical Trials-Lung Cancer Diagnostic
 
OncoCyte collaborated with the Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology (“Wistar”) to develop one of the components of the confirmatory lung cancer diagnostic test in a large, multi-site clinical study. This collaboration involved a clinical study with over 2,000 blood samples obtained from patients with a high-risk profile for development of lung cancer, which led to the discovery of biomarkers that differentially express in lung cancer patients.
 
Confirmatory diagnostics are used in conjunction with a current standard of care screening procedure. A lung confirmatory diagnostic would be used in conjunction with Low Dose CAT Scan (LDCT) to confirm a suspicious nodule by yielding a secondary suspicious versus benign result. In the case of a benign result, the patient would not need additional invasive procedures to determine the presence of cancer. In the case of a suspicious result, additional procedures would be highly warranted.
 
Both Wistar and OncoCyte have presented data at several international and regional medical conferences including: American Thoracic Society in 2016 (Wistar proof of concept study); CHEST in 2016 (Wistar larger proof of concept study, which validated the results of the ATS study); American Thoracic Society in 2017 (OncoCyte research and validation study of 299 patients that resulted in a 95% sensitivity and 73% specificity and was an independent validation); and IASLC Chicago Multidisciplinary Symposium in Thoracic Oncology in 2017 (OncoCyte analytical validation).
 
Based on these study results, OncoCyte announced that it will initiate a clinical validation phase as well as start to ramp up its commercial capabilities in anticipation of the potential commercial launch of the test. When the CLIA lab was certified OncoCyte successfully conduced a small CLIA lab validation study to demonstrate that the full assay system utilized in the CLIA lab provides the same results on clinical samples as those obtained in the R&D lab. OncoCyte began a clinical validation study on a new set of approximately 300 blinded prospectively collected blood samples to confirm whether the sensitivity and specificity of the test remain within commercial parameters in a CLIA operational setting. In November of 2017, OncoCyte announced that during the process of running initial samples for the Clinical Validation Study, inconsistent analytic results were observed by OncoCyte’s technical team. OncoCyte believes this was caused by a variance in a recently received lot of consumables used in the processing system that analyzes blood samples for the genetic markers that indicate whether lung nodules found in patients are benign or suspicious. To address this issue, OncoCyte has worked to resolve the causes of the inconsistent analytic results. In addition to seeking a solution to the problems it has encountered with the current analytic system, OncoCyte has announced that it is actively evaluating alternative analytic platforms that might be used to run DetermaVu™ diagnostic tests. At the conclusion of this process, data will be available to determine which platform delivers the most accurate, consistent and robust test results and acceptable cost. OncoCyte has announced that once it makes a final decision regarding analytic platforms, it plans to complete product development by carrying out a research and development verification study followed by an analytical validation study, and if those studies are successfully completed, a clinical validation study will be conducted, with a target of completing clinical validation for commercialization in 2018. OncoCyte has collected all the samples necessary for carrying out all these studies.
 
Clinical Trials—Breast Cancer Diagnostic
 
OncoCyte completed a strong proof of concept study for its breast cancer confirmatory test, and presented data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in December of 2016. The study looked at serum from 100 women who had a mammogram with a result of BIRADs 3 or 4. The results of this analysis were promising, with a 15-marker model producing a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 76%.
 
OncoCyte is continuing development of a breast cancer confirmatory diagnostic by conducting a larger study that it expects will analyze blood samples from approximately 300 patients with benign or malignant nodules.

Clinical Trials—Bladder Cancer Diagnostic
 
As part of the clinical development of a urine-based bladder cancer diagnostic test, OncoCyte initiated a clinical trial in January 2014 and in May of 2015, they presented preliminary findings of their bladder research, which showed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 83%. Sensitivity is the probability of detecting the presence of the disease accurately. A sensitivity of 90% means that 9 out of 10 cancers were detected. Specificity is the probability of accurately predicting not having the disease. OncoCyte has decided to pursue a co-development partner for its bladder cancer test.
2017 Highlights
 
BioTime achieved numerous strategic accomplishments during 2017, including advancing clinical trials and product development in several key programs.
 
Clinical Progress
 

● | Renevia® met its primary endpoint in a European pivotal trial of HIV-associated lipoatrophy, which is a severe form of facial lipoatrophy. The primary endpoint was the change in hemifacial volume at six months in the treated patients compared to patients in the delayed treatment arm as measured by 3-D photographic volumetric assessment. On average, 5.1cc of hemifacial volume was measured after six months, which represents an approximate 100% retention of transplanted volume. There were no device-related serious adverse events noted during the trial. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We presented positive data from the OpRegen® trial in dry-AMD. The interim data were presented on May 8, 2017 at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) in Baltimore, Maryland by Eyal Banin, MD, PhD. Imaging analysis suggested the transplanted OpRegen® cells remained in place (engrafted) in an area of the scar that was completely depleted of retinal pigment epithelium. There was also possible evidence of a biological response with some areas appearing to show structural improvement (a thickening of the thinned area of retina above the scar) without any signs of retinal edema, a fluid build-up that can further compromise vision. 
● | We expanded the OpRegen® trial in dry-AMD to the U.S. with the opening of sites in Los Angeles and San Francisco headed by two well-renowned physicians, David S. Boyer, MD of Retina-Vitreous Associates and Dr. H. Richard McDonald of West Coast Retina Medical Group. 
● | We established an innovative cell therapy manufacturing facility in Jerusalem, Israel. This new 800 square meter (8,600 square feet), state-of-the-art, cGMP manufacturing facility is located in the Jerusalem Bio Park on the campus of Hadassah University Hospital. It is equipped to produce OpRegen® and a range of cell therapy products for human use in clinical trials as well as at a grade suitable for commercial use. 
● | We expanded our ophthalmology portfolio with technology for next generation retinal disease therapies that includes composition and methodologies to develop 3-D retinal tissue derived from human pluripotent stem cells for implantation in patients with advanced stages of retinal degeneration. 
● | We hosted a Key Opinion Leader event on the topic of dry-AMD. The meeting featured a presentation by a key opinion leader, David S. Boyer, MD, Retina-Vitreous Associates, who discussed the clinical perspective and cell therapy treatment options for patients with dry-AMD. BioTime’s management team also provided an overview of the Company’s ongoing clinical development work with OpRegen®, being studied for patients with dry-AMD, including recently presented clinical trial data from the 2017 Annual ARVO meeting. 

Simplification
 

● | We consolidated our ownership of OpRegen® through an equity swap that allowed us to increase our share ownership of our Israeli subsidiary, Cell Cure, which leads the OpRegen® development program. By acquiring the Cell Cure shares held by other shareholders, we now own nearly 99% of Cell Cure. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | BioTime formed a new subsidiary, AgeX to develop its programs focused on aging. AgeX consolidated certain BioTime subsidiaries and programs in the field of interventional gerontology. The formation of AgeX continues the implementation of BioTime’s strategy to simplify its corporate structure and operations as well as focus resources on the continued clinical development of its two lead programs: Renevia® and OpRegen®. The formation of AgeX provides greater flexibility to explore external financing alternatives as well as strategic options to grow its technology platform.

Unlocking Value
 

● | AgeX raised net proceeds of $10 million, valuing AgeX at approximately $68 million post-money. BioTime now owns approximately 85% of the outstanding shares of AgeX. The financing is expected to fund AgeX’s general operations and product development well into 2019. BioTime had previously planned to spend more than $5 million annually on these programs and associated operational expenses. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In September 2017, the BioTime Board of Directors agreed in principle to distribute some or all of the AgeX shares to BioTime shareholders. We are working with investment banks and other financial institutions, the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission to finalize and implement the strategy for taking AgeX public, which may include a tax-free distribution. 

Patent Portfolio
 

● | During 2017, BioTime was issued 41 new patents to expand and bolster its patent estate, including the patent estate covering OpRegen® through 2031. These new patents add to the over 800 issued patents or pending patent applications that BioTime and its subsidiaries have invented or licensed worldwide and address many of BioTime’s key programs, including OpRegen®, which is in a Phase I/IIa trial for dry-AMD; stroke and orthopedics, which are in early stages of development; and cell culture methods that are applicable across the pluripotent cell platform that enables robust manufacturing processes for many of the products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Successful defense of two key patents related to OpRegen®. The European Patent Office (EPO), in an opposition proceeding, ruled that two patents related to OpRegen® are valid and remain in force as granted. 

Non-dilutive Funding
 

● | BioTime was awarded a new grant for 2017 of up to 7.2 million Israeli New Shekels (approximately $2 million) from the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA). The grant provides funding for the continued development of OpRegen®, and to date the IIA has provided annual grants totaling approximately $12 million. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | BioTime was awarded a grant of up to $1.56 million from the Small Business Innovation Research program of the National Institutes of Health. The grant provides funding to further develop BioTime’s innovative, next generation vision restoration program for more advanced retinal diseases and injuries, which severely impact the quality of life for millions of people with no treatment option 

Other Company News
 

● | During 2017, BioTime successfully raised $49 million in gross proceeds from new and previous investors in two underwritten public offering of our common shares.

To efficiently advance product candidates through the clinical trial process, we have historically created operating subsidiaries for each program and product line. Management believes this approach has fostered efficient use of resources and reduced shareholder dilution as compared to strategies commonly deployed by the biotechnology industry in advancing various programs and product lines through development. However, operating our business through multiple subsidiaries and affiliated companies results in certain administrative expenses that we would not incur if all our operations were conducted within BioTime itself. On the other hand, this organizational structure has facilitated our fundraising efforts and has allowed BioTime to develop multiple clinical-stage products, rather than being dependent on a single product program. We, and some of the other members of BioTime, have also received substantial amounts of non-dilutive financial support from government and nonprofit organizations that are seeking, based on rigorous scientific review processes, to identify and accelerate the development of potential breakthroughs in the treatment of various major diseases.

Patents and Trade Secrets
 
We rely primarily on patents and contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. There are no assurances that any of our intellectual property rights will guarantee protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates. We also use license agreements both to access technologies developed by other companies and universities and to convey certain intellectual property rights to others. Our financial success will be dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims, to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others if we are unable to obtain enabling licenses.
 
As of February 28, 2018, we owned or controlled or licensed directly or through our subsidiaries approximately 800 patents and pending patent applications worldwide including more than 170 issued or pending U.S. patents or patent applications. This number also includes the over 140 patents and applications licensed from WARF.
 
OpRegen® 
 
We and our subsidiary, Cell Cure, have issued patents that will provide protection to OpRegen® until about 2033, and pending applications that if issued, will provide protection to OpRegen® until December 2038.
 
Cell Cure was a party to two pending opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office (EPO) involving EP Patent Numbers 2147094 (issued 08-Oct-2014) and 2554661 (issued 19-Nov-2014), both entitled, “Stem Cell-Derived Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells”. The Oral Proceedings took place on March 16, 2017 and March 17, 2017, respectively. Both patents were upheld by the EPO. The decisions were both appealed and the detailed grounds for appeal were due on September 9, 2017 and September 11, 2017, respectively, however, both appeals were withdrawn prior to those dates and the patents will be issued as amended in the opposition proceedings. Both patents relate to our OpRegen® product and provide protection until April 2028. There are additional patent applications pending that if issued will provide further protection for OpRegen®.
 
Renevia® 
 
We have patent protection for Renevia® until about August 2027, and pending applications that if issued, will provide protection to Renevia® until June 2038.
 
Asterias Patents
 
The patent positions for Asterias’ core programs are summarized below.
 
Neural cells: This portfolio is related to Asterias’ AST-OPC1 product. The patent rights relevant to neural cells, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, include various patent families acquired from Geron that are directed to the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (including hES cells) into various neural cell types, as well as various culture and purification methods. These patent rights also include rights licensed from the Regents of the University of California. There are issued patents in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, China, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Singapore and Israel. Additionally, there are five new pending patent families owned by us directed to improved methods of producing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell compositions and methods of treatment of spinal cord injury and stroke using oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. The stroke family is jointly owned with the Regents of the University of California; the other four new pending families are solely owned by Asterias. The expiration dates of the patents acquired from Geron and in-licensed from the Regents of the University of California will be within 2021 to 2030. The potential expiry dates of the four new patent families with applications pending will be within 2036 to 2038. The commercial success of AST-OPC1 product depends, in part, upon the ability of Asterias to exclude competition for this product with the existing patent portfolio, regulatory exclusivity, or a combination of both.
 
Dendritic cells: This portfolio is related to Asterias’AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2 products. The patent rights relevant to dendritic cells include various patent families acquired by Asterias from Geron or in-licensed from third parties that are directed to the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (including hES cells) into hematopoietic progenitor cells and immature and mature dendritic cells. In addition, these patent rights include a patent family with claims directed to immunogenic compositions comprising antigen-presenting dendritic cells and methods of eliciting an anti-telomerase immune response in a subject by administering to the subject such compositions. There are issued patents in the United States, Australia, Europe, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Israel and Singapore. The expiration dates of the patents acquired from Geron and in-licensed to us range from 2019 to 2029. Additionally, there is a new pending patent family owned by Asterias with claims directed to immunotherapeutic compositions comprising immunogenic peptides and methods of eliciting a cellular mediated immune response in a subject, with a provisional patent application filed in 2017. The potential expiry date of the new patent family with a pending provisional application will be in 2038. The commercial success of AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2 products depends, in part, upon the ability of Asterias to exclude competition in these products with this patent portfolio, regulatory exclusivity, or a combination of both.

Patents covered by the exclusive option have issued in the United States, Europe, and India and patent applications are pending in the United States, Canada and India. Those patents are projected to expire in 2028 - 2030.
 
Patents Used in Our Plasma Volume Expander Business
 
We currently hold three issued U. S. patents with methods-of-use claims covering Hextend®. Our patents in the U.S., which include claims directed to methods-of-use of Hextend®, are expected to remain in force until 2019. Patents covering certain proprietary solutions have also issued in several countries and remain in force in Canada, China, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, and Taiwan.
General Risks Related to Obtaining and Enforcing Patent Protection
 
There is a risk that any patent applications that we file and any patents that we hold or later obtain could be challenged by third parties and be declared invalid or infringing on third party claims. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory protections covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity. Litigation, interference, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed any amounts that we may accrue on our financial statements as a reserve for contingent liabilities. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products and services.
 
The enforcement of patent rights often requires litigation against third-party infringers, and such litigation can be costly to pursue. Even if we succeed in having new patents issued or in defending any challenge to issued patents, there is no assurance that our patents will be comprehensive enough to provide us with meaningful patent protection against our competitors.
 
In addition to relying on patents, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological advancement to maintain our competitive position. We have entered into intellectual property, invention, and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, and it is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and know-how, or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets and know-how or obtain access to our trade secrets, know-how, or proprietary technology.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 95 employees, of which 46 are BioTime employees and 49 are employees of our subsidiaries, including foreign subsidiaries. Ninety-two employees are employed on a full-time basis and three persons are employed on a part-time basis. Twenty-three full-time employees hold Ph.D. degrees in one or more fields of science. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Manufacturing
 
Facilities Required—Cell Products
 
We lease approximately 30,795 square feet of rentable space in two buildings located in an office park setting in Alameda, California. Our subsidiaries or affiliates, OncoCyte, OrthoCyte, AgeX and ReCyte Therapeutics are also conducting their operations at our Alameda facility.
 
Cell Cure leases approximately 2,060 square meters (approximately 22,200 square feet) of office, laboratory, warehousing and cGMP production space located in Jerusalem, Israel.
 
Facilities Required—HyStem® Hydrogel Products
 
We hold a California Device Manufacturing License and has registered with the FDA as a Device Manufacturer in support of our Premvia® product. We have ISO 13485:2003 certification for the design, development, manufacture, and distribution of hydrogels for therapeutic delivery applications. While BioTime holds these certifications, licenses, and registrations, all product manufacturing occurs at contract facilities located in Pennsylvania and California. Our contractors have the necessary registrations and certifications to perform this manufacturing. Our current suppliers have the capacity to meet current and commercial requirements. We maintain laboratories for product, process, and analytical development work for HyStem® hydrogel products at our Alameda facility.
Facilities Required—Laboratory Diagnostic Tests
 
OncoCyte constructed a CLIA compliant laboratory at our Alameda facility for the performance of any cancer diagnostic tests that it may successfully develop and commercialize. OncoCyte will be required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to operate its diagnostic test laboratory, including certification, under the laws of the states from which it receives blood samples for testing, in addition to certification by California where the diagnostic laboratory is located. See “Government Regulation — Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation.”
Facilities Required—Plasma Volume Expanders
 
Hospira, Inc., a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc., manufactures our synthetic blood volume expander solution Hextend® for use in the United States and CJ Healthcare manufactures Hextend® for use in South Korea. If Hospira and CJ Health were to discontinue manufacturing Hextend®, we would need to find a replacement manufacturer willing to manufacture Hextend® us as we do not have facilities to manufacture Hextend® in commercial quantities, or under cGMP.
Raw Materials— Cell Products and HyStem® Products
 
Most of the ingredients in the HyStem® products we are developing are readily obtainable from multiple sources. Two critical ingredients, gelatin and sodium hyaluronate, are readily available from multiple sources but would require significant testing in order to qualify new vendors as sources of those ingredients for our products.
Raw Materials—Plasma Volume Expanders
 
Although most ingredients in the products we are developing are readily obtainable from multiple sources, we know of only a few manufacturers of the hydroxyethyl starches that serve as the primary drug substance in Hextend®. Hospira and CJ Health presently have a source of supply of the hydroxyethyl starch used in Hextend® and have agreed to maintain a supply sufficient to meet market demand for Hextend® in the countries in which they market the product. We believe that we will be able to obtain a sufficient supply of starch for our needs in the foreseeable future, although we do not have supply agreements in place. If for any reason a sufficient supply of hydroxyethyl starch could not be obtained, a licensee would have to acquire or obtain by contract the use of a manufacturing facility and the technology to produce the hydroxyethyl starch according to cGMP if the licensee were to elect to continue manufacturing Hextend®.

Licensed Technology and Product Development Agreements
 
BioTime and other members of BioTime have obtained the right to use technology that we believe has great potential in our product development efforts, and that may be useful to other companies that are engaged in the research and development of products for human therapeutic and diagnostic use.
Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation—Research Products
 
We have entered into a Commercial License and Option Agreement with Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (“WARF”). The WARF license permits us and our subsidiaries to use certain patented and patent pending technology belonging to WARF, as well as certain stem cell materials, for research and development purposes, and for the production and marketing of “research products” and “related products.” “Research products” are products used as research tools, including in drug discovery and development. “Related products” are products other than research products, diagnostic products, or therapeutic products. “Diagnostic products” are products or services used in the diagnosis, prognosis, screening or detection of disease in humans. “Therapeutic products” are products or services used in the treatment of disease in humans.
 
We will pay WARF a 4% royalty on the sale of research products and services and 2% on the sale of related products under the WARF license. The royalty rate is subject to certain reductions if we also become obligated to pay royalties to a third party to sell a product. We have certain options to negotiate with WARF to obtain a license to manufacture and market therapeutic products, excluding products in certain fields of use. The WARF license shall remain in effect until the last licensed patent expires, however, we may terminate prior to the expiration by giving WARF at least 90 days written notice, and WARF has industry standard termination rights.
 
PureStem® Technology
 
ReCyte Therapeutics entered into a license agreement with Advanced Cell Technology, Inc., which later became Ocata Therapeutics, Inc. (“Ocata”) that was subsequently assigned to us and under which we acquired exclusive world-wide rights to use Ocata’s technology for methods to accelerate the isolation of novel cell strains from pluripotent stem cells. The licensed rights include pending patent applications, know-how, and existing cells and cell lines developed using the technology.
 
The licensed technology is designed to provide a large-scale and reproducible method of isolating clonally purified human embryonic progenitor cells or hEPCs, many of which may be capable of extended propagation in vitro. Initial testing suggests that the technology may be used to isolate at least 200 distinct clones that contain many previously uncharacterized cell types derived from all germ layers that display diverse embryo- and site-specific homeobox gene expression. Despite the expression of many oncofetal genes, none of the hEPC tested led to tumor formation when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. The cells studied appear to have a finite replicative lifespan but have longer telomeres than most fetal- or adult-derived cells, which may facilitate their use in the manufacture of purified lineages for research and human therapy. Information concerning the technology was published in the May 2008 edition of the journal Regenerative Medicine.
 
We have the right to use the licensed technology and cell lines for research purposes and for the development of therapeutic and diagnostic products for human and veterinary use, and we also have the right to grant sublicenses. We paid Ocata a $250,000 license fee as well as an 8% royalty on sales of products, services, and processes that utilize the licensed technology. Once a total of $1.0 million of royalties has been paid, no further royalties will be due.
 
Ocata may reacquire royalty-free, worldwide licenses to use the technology for RPE cells, hemangioblasts, and myocardial cells, on an exclusive basis, and for hepatocytes, on a non-exclusive basis, for human therapeutic use. Ocata will pay us $5,000 for each license that it elects to reacquire.
 
The term of the licenses from Ocata expire on the later of July 9, 2028 or the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents. The latest expiration date of patents issued is October 12, 2026, but the expiration date of the licenses could be extended if the patent expiration dates are extended. Ocata may terminate the license agreement if we commit a breach or default in the performance of our obligations under the agreement and fail to cure the breach or default within the permitted cure periods. BioTime has the right to terminate the license agreement at any time by giving Ocata three months’ prior notice and paying all amounts due to Ocata through the effective date of the termination.

Heraeus had additional industry standard termination rights. OrthoCyte has also licensed the OrthoCyte Technology to Heraeus, and Heraeus has licensed the Heraeus Technology to OrthoCyte. The license grant by OrthoCyte to Heraeus is exclusive and worldwide in the field of bone grafting for all osteoskelton diseases and injuries, except oral maxilla-facial. The license grant by Heraeus to OrthoCyte is exclusive and worldwide in all other fields. Pursuant to the License Agreement, each of Heraeus and OrthoCyte will pay certain specified royalties to each other based on their respective net sales of the product developed in the research and development project. The License Agreement contains customary confidentiality obligations, and representations and warranties, and termination provisions.
 
Hadasit Research and License Agreement
 
Cell Cure has a Second Amended and Restated License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd. (“Hadasit”), the commercial arm and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hadassah Medical Organization. Pursuant to the License Agreement, Hadasit granted Cell Cure an exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing license (with the right to grant sublicenses) in its intellectual property portfolio of materials and technology related to human stem cell derived photoreceptor cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells (the “Licensed IP”), to use, commercialize and exploit any part thereof, in any manner whatsoever in the fields of the development and exploitation of (i) human stem cell derived photoreceptor cells, solely for use in cell therapy for the diagnosis, amelioration, prevention and treatment of eye disorders, and (ii) human stem cell derived retinal pigment epithelial cells, solely for use in cell therapy for the diagnosis, amelioration, prevention and treatment of eye disorders.

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, quality, approval, safety, efficacy, distribution, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, marketing, import/export and promotion of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Laboratories performing diagnostic tests such as those being developed by OncoCyte are also subject to regulation at both the federal and state level. Authorities also heavily regulate many of these activities for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products or HCT/Ps.
 
FDA and Foreign Regulation of Therapeutic Products
 
The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs, biologicals, or medical devices, depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of the product with the human body. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologicals under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. In addition, establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and HCT/Ps are subject to additional registration and listing requirements, including current good tissue practice regulations. Certain cell therapy proposed products will be reviewed by the FDA staff in its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies.
 
Our domestic human drug and biological products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate, an investigational new drug (“IND”) submission must be made to the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution.
 
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three “phases.” Phase I clinical trials are conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers or volunteers with the target disease or condition to assess safety. Phase II clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with the target disease or condition in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III trials are large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials and are conducted with patients afflicted with the target disease or condition in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the clinical trial based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the intended patient population. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. The time and expense required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product.
 
No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the U.S. until an appropriate New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologics License Application (BLA) has been approved by the FDA. Submission of the application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing, following the FDA’s review, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to FDA approval. To date, the FDA has not granted marketing approval to any pluripotent stem-based therapeutic products and it is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject our product candidates to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologicals derived from other technologies.

The FDA offers several programs to expedite development of products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. A product may be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. In December 2016, in the 21st Century Cures Act adopted a new designation of Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation. Under the 21st Century Cures Act, a drug is eligible for designation as a regenerative medicine advanced therapy (“RMAT,” formerly known as “Regenerative Advanced Therapy”) if: the drug is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under certain other sections; the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Some of our current and future products may be eligible for RMAT designation. RMAT designation allows for similar benefits as the breakthrough therapy designation. There is no assurance that the FDA will grant breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval or RMAT status to any of our product candidates.
 
Certain Medical Devices
 
Obtaining regulatory approval of Renevia® or a similar implantable matrix for tissue transplant or stem cell therapy in Europe will require the preparation of a design dossier containing details on the product manufacturing and production methods, analytical controls to assure that the product meets its release specification, data from analytical assay and process validations, ISO 10993 biocompatibility testing, as well as pre-clinical and clinical safety and efficacy data. Completion of the manufacturing, analytical, biocompatibility, and clinical trials represents a majority of the expenses associated with the regulatory application process in Europe. The procedures for obtaining FDA approval to sell products in the U.S. are likely to be more stringent, and the cost greater, than would be the case in an application for approval in Europe.
Combination Products
 
If we develop any products that are used with medical devices, they may be considered combination products, which are defined by the FDA to include products comprised of two or more regulated components or parts such as a biologic and a device. For example, our HyStem® hydrogel products such as Renevia® may be used to administer one or more pluripotent stem cell-based therapy products. When regulated independently, biologics and devices each have their own regulatory requirements. However, the regulatory requirements for a combination product comprised of a biologic administered with a delivery device can be more complex, because in addition to the individual regulatory requirements for each component, additional combination product regulatory requirements may apply. There is an Office of Combination Products at the FDA that coordinates the review of such products and determines the primary mode of action of a combination product. The definition and regulatory requirements for combination products may differ significantly among countries in which we may seek approval of our product candidates.
 
FDA Regulation of Manufacturing
 
The FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, human tissue and cell products, and medical devices, requiring that they be produced in compliance with cGMP. See “Manufacturing.” The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA, a material change is made to manufacturing equipment or to the location or manufacturing process, additional regulatory review may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes of manufacturers following an initial approval. If, as a result of those inspections, the FDA determines that that equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against the manufacturer, including suspension of manufacturing operations. Issues pertaining to manufacturing equipment, facilities or processes may also delay the approval of new products undergoing FDA review.
 
FDA Regulation of Advertising and Product Promotion
 
The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used to market pharmaceutical and biological products. Claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA, a BLA, or a pre-market notification or pre-market approval application for a medical device (“PMA”), or an amendment to an NDA, a BLA, or a pre-market notification or PMA, and must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

Federal Funding of Research
 
The United States government and its agencies have until relatively recently refused to fund research which involves the use of human embryonic tissue. President Bush issued Executive Orders on August 9, 2001 and June 20, 2007 that permitted federal funding of research on hES cells using only the limited number of hES cell lines that had already been created as of August 9, 2001. On March 9, 2009, President Obama issued an Executive Order rescinding President Bush’s August 9, 2001 and June 20, 2007 Executive Orders. President Obama’s Executive Order also instructed the NIH to review existing guidance on human stem cell research and to issue new guidance on the use of hES cells in federally funded research, consistent with President’s new Executive Order and existing law. The NIH has adopted new guidelines that went into effect July 7, 2009. The central focus of the new guidelines is to assure that hES cells used in federally funded research were derived from human embryos that were created for reproductive purposes, were no longer needed for this purpose, and were voluntarily donated for research purposes with the informed written consent of the donors. Those hES cells that were derived from embryos created for research purposes rather than reproductive purposes, and other hES cells that were not derived in compliance with the guidelines, are not eligible for use in federally funded research.
 
In addition to President Obama’s Executive Order, a bipartisan bill has been introduced in the U.S. Senate that would allow Federal funding of hES research. The Senate bill is identical to one that was previously approved by both Houses of Congress but vetoed by President Bush. The Senate Bill provides that hES cells will be eligible for use in research conducted or supported by federal funding if the cells meet each of the following guidelines: (1) the stem cells were derived from human embryos that have been donated from IVF clinics, were created for the purposes of fertility treatment, and were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such treatment, (2) prior to the consideration of embryo donation and through consultation with the individuals seeking fertility treatment, it was determined that the embryos would never be implanted in a woman and would otherwise be discarded, and (3) the individuals seeking fertility treatment donated the embryos with written informed consent and without receiving any financial or other inducements to make the donation. The Senate Bill authorizes the NIH to adopt further guidelines consistent with the legislation.
 
California State Regulations
 
The state of California has adopted legislation and regulations that require institutions that conduct stem cell research to notify, and in certain cases obtain approval from, a Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee (“SCRO Committee”) before conducting the research. Under certain California regulations, all hES cell lines that will be used in our research must be acceptably derived.
 
We also comply with certain California regulations that require certain records to be maintained with respect to stem cell research and the materials used.
 
We have formed a SCRO Committee which reviews each of BioTime’s projects that involve the use of pluripotent stem cells. The committee reviews and confirms that we are using only hES cell lines that have been acceptably derived and that the research conducted using these cells lines is both scientifically and ethically justified under existing California regulations. The OpRegen® program has been reviewed by the SCRO Committee and we believe that we comply with applicable federal and state guidelines. The hES cell lines that we use are all on the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) registry of lines that have been reviewed and meet standards for federal funding grants.
 
Regulation of Diagnostic Tests
 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation
 
As a provider of laboratory testing on human specimens for the purpose of disease diagnosis, prevention, or treatment, OncoCyte is required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct its business. In 1988, Congress enacted the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, (“CLIA”), which established quality standards for all laboratories providing testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. OncoCyte’s laboratory has obtained a CLIA certificate of accreditation and is currently licensed in California. OncoCyte will be required to meet laboratory licensing and other requirements under laws of additional states in which it will operate or from which OncoCyte will receive blood samples for testing. OncoCyte will be subject to regular surveys and inspections to assess compliance with applicable regulatory standards. If OncoCyte’s CLIA laboratory were to fall out of compliance with California standards, the California Department of Health Services (“DHS”) may suspend, restrict or revoke the license to operate the laboratory, assess substantial civil money penalties, or impose specific corrective action plans.

FDA Regulation of Diagnostic Tests
 
OncoCyte’s diagnostic tests will likely be classified as laboratory diagnostic tests (“LDTs”), and consequently be governed under the CLIA regulations, as administered by The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), as well as by applicable state laws. Historically, the FDA has exercised enforcement restraint with respect to most LDTs and has not required laboratories that offer LDTs to comply with FDA requirements for medical devices, such as registration, device listing, quality systems regulations, premarket clearance or premarket approval, and post-market controls. In recent years, however, the FDA has stated it intends to end its policy of enforcement restraint and begin regulating certain LDTs as medical devices. On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents, entitled “Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)” and “FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)”, respectively, that set forth a proposed risk-based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs. The FDA has indicated that it does not intend to modify its policy of enforcement restraint until the draft guidance documents are finalized. It is unclear at this time when, or if, the draft guidance documents will be finalized, and even then, the new regulatory requirements are proposed to be phased-in consistent with the schedule set forth in the guidance, which may happen in as little as 12 months after the draft guidance is finalized for certain high-priority LDTs. Nevertheless, the FDA may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time.
 
On January 13, 2017, the FDA issued a Discussion Paper on LDTs (“Discussion Paper”), which follows the FDA’s late 2016 announcement that contrary to its earlier reports, it would not issue a final guidance on its proposed oversight of LDTs and allow for further public discussion on appropriate oversight. As it did in its 2014 guidance documents, the FDA continues to advocate a risk-based approach to LDT oversight and proposes focusing on new and significantly modified high and moderate risk LDTs; however, new and significantly modified LDTs in certain categories would not be expected to comply with premarket review, quality systems, and registration and listing requirements unless necessary to protect public health. These exempt categories include low risk LDTs, LDTs for rare diseases, traditional LDTs, LDTs intended solely for public health surveillance, certain LDTs used in CLIA certified labs, and LDTs intended solely for forensic use. Based on the FDA’s guidance in the Discussion Paper, our products will likely not require FDA filing before launch. With respect to the post market surveillance of LDTs, the FDA’s Discussion Paper recommends that laboratories initially report serious adverse events for all tests except the exempted categories if tests, which include LDTs intended for public health surveillance, some stem cell/tissue/organ transplantation LDTs, and LDTs intended solely for forensic use. The Discussion Paper notes that while the report neither represents the formal position of the FDA nor is it a final version of the LDT guidance documents published in 2014, it is hoped that its publication will continue to advance further public disclosure.
 
In Vitro Diagnostics
 
In the future, OncoCyte may elect to develop IVDs, which are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. Medical devices marketed in the United States are subject to the regulatory controls under CLIA, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and regulations adopted by the FDA. Some requirements, known as premarket requirements, apply to medical devices before they are marketed, and other requirements, known as post-market requirements, apply to medical devices after they are marketed.
 
The premarket requirements that must be met to market a medical device in the United States will depend on the classification of the device under FDA regulations. Medical devices are categorized into one of three classes, based on the degree of risk they present. Devices that pose the lowest risk are designated as Class I devices, devices that pose moderate risk are designated as Class II devices and are subject to general controls and special controls, and the devices that pose the highest risk are designated as Class III devices and are subject to general controls and premarket approval.
 
A premarket submission to the FDA will be required for some Class I devices, most Class II devices, and all Class III devices. Most Class I and some Class II devices are exempt from premarket submission requirements. Some Class I and most Class II devices may only be marketed after a 510(k) premarket notification, while a more extensive PMA or Premarket Approval is required to market Class III devices.
 
Until all regulatory requirements are phased in OncoCyte’s initial confirmatory diagnostics will not require FDA filing before launch, and instead will be subject to CLIA certification and inspection requirements. If the new requirements are phased in or if OncoCyte elects to develop IVDs, those future screenings diagnostics may require a 510(k) submission or a PMA. In a 510(k) submission, the device sponsor must demonstrate that the new device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device in terms of intended use, technological characteristics, and performance testing. A 510(k) requires demonstration of substantial equivalence to another device that is legally marketed in the United States. Substantial equivalence means that the new device is at least as safe and effective as the predicate. A device is substantially equivalent if, in comparison to a predicate it (a) has the same intended use as the predicate; has the same technological characteristics as the predicate; or (b) has the same intended use as the predicate; and has different technological characteristics and the information submitted to FDA; does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness; and is demonstrated to be at least as safe and effective as the legally marketed predicate device.

A claim of substantial equivalence does not mean the new and predicate devices must be identical. Substantial equivalence is established with respect to intended use, design, energy used or delivered, materials, chemical composition, manufacturing process, performance, safety, effectiveness, labeling, biocompatibility, standards, and other characteristics. A device may not be marketed in the United States until the submitter receives a letter declaring the device substantially equivalent. If the FDA determines that a device is not substantially equivalent, the applicant may resubmit another 510(k) with new data, or request a Class I or II designation through the FDA’s de novo process that allows a new device without a valid predicate to be classified into Class I or II if it meets certain criteria, or file a reclassification petition, or submit a PMA.
 
A new 510(k) submission is required for changes or modifications to an existing approved device, where the modifications could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or the device, is to be marketed for a new or different indication for use.
 
A PMA for Class III devices is the most stringent type of premarket submission. Before the FDA approves a PMA, the sponsor must provide valid scientific evidence demonstrating reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device’s intended use.
 
Submission of an application is no guarantee that CMS or FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing or licensing, following CMS or FDA’s review, CMS or FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval.
 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 
Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties.
 
CMS and the Office of Civil Rights issued a final rule in February 2014 to amend both the HIPAA and CLIA regulations. The final rule amended the HIPAA privacy rule to remove the CLIA laboratory exceptions, and as a result, HIPAA-covered laboratories are now required to provide individuals, upon request, with access to their completed test reports. Under the 2014 rules CLIA laboratories and CLIA-exempt laboratories may provide copies of a patient’s completed test reports that, using the laboratory’s authentication process, can be identified as belonging to that patient. These changes to the CLIA regulations and the HIPAA Privacy Rule provide individuals with a greater ability to access their health information, empowering them to take a more active role in managing their healthcare. CLIA laboratories must create and maintain policies, procedures, and other documentation necessary to inform patients of the right to access laboratory test reports and how to exercise that right.
 
The requirements under these regulations may periodically change and could have an effect on OncoCyte’s business operations if compliance becomes substantially more costly than under current requirements. New laws governing privacy may also be adopted in the future. We can provide no assurance that OncoCyte will remain in compliance with diverse privacy requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which it does business. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on OncoCyte’s business.
 
Physician Referral Prohibitions
 
Under a federal law directed at “self-referral,” commonly known as the Stark Law, there are prohibitions, with certain exceptions, on Medicare and Medicaid payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have a “financial relationship”—including an investment or ownership interest or a compensation arrangement—with the clinical laboratory performing the tests. Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements, and (4) personal services arrangements that satisfy certain requirements. The laboratory cannot submit claims to the Medicare Part B program for services furnished in violation of the Stark Law, and Medicaid reimbursements may be at risk as well. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals.

Corporate Practice of Medicine
 
A number of states, including California, do not allow business corporations to employ physicians to provide professional services. This prohibition against the “corporate practice of medicine” is aimed at preventing corporations such as OncoCyte from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians. The state licensure statutes and regulations and agency and court decisions that enumerate the specific corporate practice rules vary considerably from state to state and are enforced by both the courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. If regulatory authorities or other parties in any jurisdiction successfully assert that OncoCyte is engaged in the unauthorized corporate practice of medicine, OncoCyte could be required to restructure its contractual and other arrangements. In addition, violation of these laws may result in sanctions imposed against OncoCyte and/or the professional through licensure proceedings, and OncoCyte could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could result in exclusion from state and federal health care programs.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
A variety of federal and state laws prohibit fraud and abuse. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for HHS, and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. These contractors include Recovery Audit Contractors, Medicaid Integrity Contractors and Zone Program Integrity Contractors. In addition, CMS conducts Comprehensive Error Rate Testing audits, the purpose of which is to detect improper Medicare payments. Any overpayments identified must be repaid unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti- Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the Office of Inspector General for HHS has issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain requirements that, if met, will assure immunity from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued.
 
HIPAA also created new federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from federal health care programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from federal health care programs.
 
Many states have laws similar to the federal laws described above and the state laws may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor.
 
Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.

Online Database Products
 
LifeMap Sciences sells subscriptions primarily through the internet to its database products to biotech and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. The GeneCards® Suite, includes GeneCards®, the leading human gene database, and MalaCards™, the human disease database.
Plasma Volume Expanders
 
Hextend® is being distributed in the U.S. by Hospira and in South Korea by CJ Healthcare under exclusive licenses from us. Because Hextend® is a surgical product, sales efforts are directed to physicians and hospitals. Hextend® competes with other products used to treat or prevent hypovolemia, including albumin, generic 6% hetastarch solutions, and crystalloid solutions. The competing products have been commonly used in surgery and trauma care for many years, and in order to sell Hextend®, physicians must be convinced to change their product loyalties. The market price of albumin has declined and generic 6% hetastarch solutions sell at low prices, which has caused Hospira and CJ Healthcare to lower the prices at which they sell Hextend®.
 
In addition to price competition, sales of Hextend® have been adversely affected if certain safety labeling changes required by the FDA for the entire class of hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend®. The labeling changes were approved by the FDA in November 2013 and include a boxed warning stating that the use of hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend®, increases the risk of mortality and renal injury requiring renal replacement therapy in critically ill adult patients, including patients with sepsis, and that Hextend® should not be used in critically ill adult patients, including patients with sepsis. Warning and precaution information is required along with information about contraindications, adverse reactions, and certain recent studies. The warning and precautions include avoiding the use of Hextend® in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, that the coagulation status of patients undergoing open heart surgery in association with cardiopulmonary bypass should be monitored as excess bleeding has been reported with hydroxyethyl starch solutions in that population, that the use of Hextend® should be discontinued at the first sign of coagulopathy, and that the liver function of patients receiving hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend® should also be monitored.

Therapeutic Products and Medical Devices
 
Because our planned therapeutic products and medical devices are still in the research and development stage, we will not initially need to have our own marketing personnel. If we or our subsidiaries are successful in developing marketable therapeutic products and medical devices we will need to build our own marketing and distribution capability for those products, which would require the investment of significant financial and management resources, or we and our subsidiaries will need to find collaborative marketing partners, independent sales representatives, or wholesale distributors for the commercial sale of those products.
 
If we market products through arrangements with third parties, we may pay sales commissions to sales representatives or we may sell or consign products to distributors at wholesale prices. This means that our gross profit from product sales may be less than would be the case if we were to sell our products directly to end users at retail prices through our own sales force. On the other hand, selling to distributors or through independent sales representatives would allow us to avoid the cost of hiring and training our own sales employees. There can be no assurance we will be able to negotiate distribution or sales agreements with third parties on favorable terms to justify our investment in our products or achieve sufficient revenues to support our operations.
 
Laboratory Diagnostic Tests
 
Following completion of clinical validation, OncoCyte will market its diagnostic tests directly to health care providers working in the areas of cancer for which OncoCyte develops liquid biopsy tests. The health care providers will collect blood samples or send patients to laboratories to have blood samples collected. The blood samples will be sent to OncoCyte’s CLIA laboratory, either by the health care provider or the laboratory, where the sample will be run through an assay and a gene expression classifier to determine a binary result, either benign or suspicious. That result will be presented to the physician ordering the procedure in a standardized report. OncoCyte expects to ramp up sales and marketing teams in coordination with progress in the development of its diagnostic tests and over time will continue to grow its sales, market access and marketing organizations to increase the awareness and utilization of its diagnostic tests.
Competition
 
We face substantial competition in all of fields of business in which we engage. That competition is likely to intensify as new products and technologies reach the market. Superior new products are likely to sell for higher prices and generate higher profit margins if acceptance by the medical community is achieved. Those companies that are successful at being the first to introduce new products and technologies to the market may gain significant economic advantages over their competitors in the establishment of a customer base and track record for the performance of their products and technologies. Such companies will also benefit from revenues from sales that could be used to strengthen their research and development, production, and marketing resources. Companies engaged in the medical products industry face the risk of obsolescence of their products and technologies as more advanced or cost-effective products and technologies are developed by competitors. As the industry matures, companies will compete based upon the performance and cost-effectiveness of their products.
Products for Regenerative Medicine
 
The cell therapy industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, and chemical and medical products companies operating in the fields of regenerative medicine, cell therapy, tissue engineering, and tissue regeneration. Many of these companies are well established and possess technical, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, certain smaller biotech companies have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships, and other types of joint ventures with larger, well-established industry competitors that afford the smaller companies’ potential research and development as well as commercialization advantages. Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities, which may produce products directly competitive to those we are developing.
 
We believe that some of our competitors are trying to develop pluripotent cells and hEPC-based technologies and products that may compete with our stem cell products based on efficacy, safety, cost, and intellectual property positions. We are aware that Ocata, which was recently acquired by a subsidiary of Astellas Pharma Inc., and Retinal Patch Technologies Inc., are conducting clinical trials of a hES cell products designed to treat age-related macular degeneration. If their products are proven to be safe and effective, they may reach the market ahead of OpRegen®.
 

34
--

 

We may also face competition from companies that have filed patent applications relating to the propagation and differentiation of stem cells. Those companies include Ocata, which in 2015 had certain U.S. patents issue with claims directed to methods of producing RPE cells and isolating and purifying such cells. We may be required to seek licenses from these competitors in order to commercialize certain products proposed by us, and such licenses may not be granted.
 
Cancer Diagnostic Testing
 
The cancer diagnostic test industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. OncoCyte’s competitors include major multinational diagnostic companies and specialty biotechnology companies. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than OncoCyte’s. In addition, smaller biotech companies may form strategic collaborations, partnerships, and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies’ potential research and development and commercialization advantages. Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce diagnostic tests directly competitive to those OncoCyte is developing.
 
Molecular diagnostic competitors in the category of OncoCyte’s first planned diagnostic test launch (lung confirmatory) include two currently marketed diagnostic tests. Xpresys Lung was launched in late 2013 by Integrated Diagnostics and that company has recently announced coverage by major payers. The other currently marketed diagnostic test is Early CDT lung, which was launched in 2012 by a European diagnostics company OncImmune Ltd. OncImmune has sold its U.S. assets to a CLIA laboratory, operating under the name OncImmune USA, LLC. Additionally, OncoCyte anticipates competition from Exact Sciences Corp, Gensignia Life Sciences, Inc. and Veracyte, Inc. which have diagnostic tests in the pipeline. Gensignia announced the certification of its CLIA lab in October 2015.
 
In addition to molecular diagnostics, an imaging competitor has a diagnostic test that may compete directly in confirmatory lung diagnostic testing. VisionGate, Inc. has a sputum test that is read by their proprietary system, which takes an optical CT scan of individual cells to generate 3D images of each cell.
 
Plasma Volume Expanders
 
Our plasma volume expander solution, Hextend®, competes with products currently used to treat or prevent hypovolemia, including albumin, other colloid solutions, and crystalloid solutions presently manufactured by established pharmaceutical companies, and with human blood products. To compete with new and existing plasma expanders, we have developed products that contain constituents that may prevent or reduce the physiological imbalances, bleeding, fluid overload, edema, poor oxygenation, and organ failure that can occur when competing products are used.
 
Hextend® competes with products that are commonly used in surgery and trauma care, and some, especially crystalloids, sell at low prices. The competing products are being manufactured and marketed by established pharmaceutical companies with large research facilities, technical staffs, and financial and marketing resources. B. Braun presently markets Hespan®, an artificial plasma volume expander containing 6% hetastarch in saline solution. Hospira and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries sell a generic equivalent of Hespan®. Hospira, also markets Voluven®, a plasma volume expander containing a 6% low molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch in saline solution. Sanofi-Aventis, Baxter International, and Alpha Therapeutics sell albumin, and Hospira, Baxter International, and B. Braun sell crystalloid solutions. As a result of the introduction of generic plasma expanders and new proprietary products, competition in the plasma expander market has intensified, and wholesale prices of both hetastarch products and albumin have declined which has forced Hospira and CJ Healthcare to make reduce the price at which they sell Hextend® in order to maintain their share of the market.
