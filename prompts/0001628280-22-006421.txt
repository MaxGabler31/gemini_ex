Competition
Our business is characterized by innovation and rapid change. Our Indoor Intelligence products compete with companies that offer positioning and asset tracking products and services, indoor mapping solutions, or workplace experience apps. For positioning we compete with companies such as Aruba, Cisco, Mist Networks/Juniper Networks, Aislelabs and Bluevision/HID. For our workplace experience app, events and executive briefing center products we compete with Modo, Comfy, On24, Cvent, Signet and BriefingEdge. For our mapping product, we compete with companies such as MappedIn, Mapwize and Esri. For asset tracking and our Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) products, we compete with Ubisense, Sewio, Kinexon, Zebra Technologies, Stanley Healthcare and other mostly vertical focused RTLS companies. The positioning companies primarily offer BLE or Wi-Fi detection and, therefore, we believe they cannot achieve the same accuracy and comprehensive detection that we do. We have partnered with or replaced some of these companies because we offer GPS, Cellular/LTE, Wi-Fi, BLE, CSS and UWB solutions that can deliver the level of accuracy required for the customer use case. Most of the companies above are focused on one product and/or vertical and, at this time, we believe none of them have the complete offering of positioning, mapping, RTLS and analytics.
We believe we offer a unique and differentiated approach to the market with our indoor intelligence offering which is:
•Comprehensive. We integrate a myriad of indoor data inputs and outputs. The technology supports a multitude of use cases including workplace experience, asset tracking, navigation, facility management, analytics, and security across numerous industries in both the private and public sector.
•Scalable. We are built to support customers’ expanding needs and use cases. Unlike other competitive point-solutions, we can offer expansion paths and support for a wide variety of location based use cases. Our multi-layered depiction of indoor data allows users to see the information layer(s) most relevant to their role, in the optimal format for them (e.g., charts, tables, maps, etc.).
•Technology-agnostic. We embrace an ecosystem of hardware, software, integration and distribution partners welcoming integration and synchronization with third party data and systems in combination with our platform. Our open architecture is designed to enable the integration of disparate technologies, preserve investment and avoid obsolesce. APIs make it possible to move data in and out of our platform. Our SDKs enable developers to build new apps or to integrate location data into their existing mobile apps, websites or kiosks.
MerlinOne and PressTeligence compete with the functionality of our Shoom products, but typically provide information only for the specific customer and not for the customer’s competitors or for the industry.
 Originlab and Graphpad Prism are the main competitors of our SAVES products.
