On March 21, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement with Michael R. Rosa and Enviromart Industries, our sole operating subsidiary, pursuant to which we transferred to Mr. Rosa all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Enviromart Industries.
 
In consideration for the transfer of the operating subsidiary to Mr. Rosa, he surrendered to us all 13,657,500 shares of the Company’s common stock then owned by him, which shares were returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares. In addition, Mr. Rosa and Enviromart Industries agreed to assume and discharge any and all of the Company’s liabilities existing as the closing date, of which there was none, as all of the Company’s operations have been conducted through Enviromart Industries (its sole operating subsidiary).
 
The above described purchase and sale transaction closed on July 21, 2016, effective April 1, 2016, and was approved by a majority of the Company’s shareholders by written consent on May 4, 2016. As a result of the completion of the purchase and sale transaction, the Company’s operating business has been discontinued, and it is focusing on seeking to acquire an operating business with strong growth potential.
 
On October 5, 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Eastone SPA”) with Eastone Equities, LLC, a New York limited liability company (“Eastone Equities”) and certain selling stockholders (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which Eastone Equities acquired 44,566,412 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Shares”) from Sellers for an aggregate purchase price of $295,000. The transaction contemplated by the Eastone SPA closed on October 9, 2017. The Shares represented approximately 90% of issued and outstanding shares of common of the Company. The transaction resulted in a change in control of the Company. Effective as of October 23, 2017, the Company changed its name to “ECARD INC.”
 
Following the closing of the transactions set forth in the Eastone SPA, the Company now has only minimal assets and liabilities. Its operations are focused on seeking to acquire an operating business with strong growth potential. From and after the sale, unless and until the Company completes an acquisition, its expenses are expected to consist solely of legal, accounting and compliance costs, including those related to complying with reporting obligations under the Securities and Exchange act of 1934.
 
We are now considered a blank check company. The SEC defines those companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Exchange Act, and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.” Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), we also qualify as a “shell company,” because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements.
 
Our current business plan is to attempt to identify and negotiate with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into the Company. In certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of the Company or may wish to contribute or sell assets to the Company rather than to merge. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in identifying or negotiating with any target company. We seek to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting or public company whose securities are qualified for trading in the United States secondary markets.
 
A business combination with a target company normally will involve the transfer to the target company of the majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, and the substitution by the target company of its own management and Board. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to enter into a business combination, or, if the Company does enter into such a business combination, no assurances can be given as to the terms of a business combination, or as to the nature of the target company.
