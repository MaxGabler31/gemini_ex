ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General 
 
MariMed Inc. (“we”, “our”, “us”, or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is an industry leader in the emerging legal cannabis industry. We are a professional management company that advises our clients in securing cannabis licenses, and in turn, we develop and manage state-of-the-art, regulatory-compliant facilities for the cultivation, production, and dispensing of legal cannabis and cannabis-infused products. Along with this operational oversight, we provide our clients with legal, accounting, human resources, and other corporate and administrative services.
 
The Company has also created a custom brand of cannabis-infused products, under the brand name Kalm Fusion™, which are licensed and distributed nationally in those states where such products may legally be distributed. These products are precision-dosed and designed for specific medical conditions and related symptoms. In 2017, the Company acquired the Betty’s Eddies™ brand of cannabis-infused fruit chews, and expanded its distribution of Lucid Mood™ disposable vape pens, further expanding the Company’s brand portfolio and product line.
 
The Company’s stock is quoted on the OTCQB market under the ticker symbol MRMD.
 
Since focusing on the cannabis industry in 2014, the Company’s operations have increased significantly each year. For the year ended 2017, revenues increased 70% to $6.1 million, operating income increased 56% to $1.2 million, and total assets increased 276% to $32.2 million. Similarly, our client company revenues increased to $12.2 million, a 79.4% increase from the year ended 2016.

Corporate History
 
The Company was originally formed in January 2011 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Worlds Inc. (formerly Worlds.com Inc.) under the name Worlds Online Inc. In May 2011, Worlds Online Inc. commenced the spin-off of the Company, which was consummated after SEC review in May 2012.

The Company’s initial ticker symbol was WORX, and since inception, the Company has operated an online portal that offers multi-user virtual environments to users. Over time, however, this business model declined, and it has had insignificant operating activity since 2014.
 
In early 2014, the Company pivoted its operational focus to the emerging cannabis industry. In order to quickly gain traction into this new space, in May 2014, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary MariMed Advisors Inc. (“MMA”), acquired Sigal Consulting LLC (“Sigal”), a company operating in the cannabis industry.
 
The purchase price paid to the former owners of Sigal consisted of (i) an aggregate amount of the Company’s common stock equal to 50% of the outstanding shares on the closing date of September 29, 2014, (ii) options to purchase three million shares of the Company’s common stock, exercisable over five years with exercise prices ranging from $0.15 to $0.35, and (iii) a 49% ownership interest in MMA.
 
This transaction was accounted for as a purchase acquisition where the Company was both the legal and accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the Company recorded as goodwill the value of the common stock and options issued in excess of the Sigal assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This goodwill was subsequently deemed impaired in full and written down to zero.
 
In early 2017, the Company changed its name to MariMed Inc. and its ticker symbol to MRMD. Also during this time, the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common and preferred stock were increased to 500 million and 50 million, respectively.
 
In June 2017, the Company purchased the remaining 49% interest in MMA in exchange for 75 million shares of common stock.
 
In July 2017, Robert Fireman was named as the Company’s CEO and President, and Jon R. Levine as the CFO, Treasurer, and Secretary.
 
In late 2017, the Company acquired the intellectual property, formulations, recipes, proprietary equipment, and know-how of the Betty’s Eddies™ brand of cannabis-infused fruit chews which are handcrafted with all-natural ingredients and sweetened with non-GMO organic fruits and vegetables. The Company plans to roll out the Betty’s Eddies product line throughout its licensee network and to hundreds additional legal dispensaries in multiple states in 2018.


Business Activities
 
The Company offers a comprehensive suite of products in those states with newly passed medical marijuana regulations and/or recreational use marijuana. These services include fee-based assistance to applicants applying for state regulated cannabis licenses. For those who are awarded a license MariMed provides consultative services for all aspects required for the design, and operation of cannabis cultivation, production, and dispensing facilities.
 
The Company does not currently own licenses with respect to, nor sell, cannabis products. Our goal is to be an industry leader in providing professional management and advisory services to the cannabis industry. We have developed proprietary operating processes and procedures to provide best practices to our clients. These services are also offered to existing licensed marijuana facilities across the country. In such cases, we can reengineer such licensees’ facilities, or purchase and develop new ones to maximize the value of their licenses, while also providing ongoing advisory services.
 
Cannabis remains a Controlled Substance under federal law which makes conventional funding difficult to obtain. Accordingly, the demand for private funding in this industry is enormous, which the Company has been successful in raising.
 
The Company has developed a brand of cannabis-infused products that are designed to be precision-dosed for specific medical conditions and symptoms. These products are developed by the Company in cooperation with state-licensed facilities and operators who meet the Company’s strict standards: all natural— not artificial or synthetic — ingredients that are locally grown by knowledgeable growers who will apply our scientific formulations with trademarked product recipes.
 
The Company’s product line includes Kalm Fusion™, Mari Melts™, Powdered Tincture™, Kalm Corn™, and now Betty’s Eddies™. All of these branded products utilize ingredients that are infused with THC or CBD cannabis oil extracts designed for enjoyable, predictable relief.

MariMed is working to develop patient assessment programs for licensed facilities to support research in the industry We believe that tracking outcomes and maintaining a good regimen with the patient will assist dispensaries in safely providing safe and reliable products to patients.
 
Business Structure
 
MariMed creates private limited liability companies to fund and develop cultivation, processing, and dispensing facilities. These single facility LLCs are sometimes jointly owned by MariMed and investors with the share of ownership and the allocation of return negotiated on a deal specific basis. This structure was used in projects in Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Nevada.
 
As of December 31, 2017, MariMed had developed and is managing for clients six operating cannabis facilities in Delaware, Illinois, Nevada, and Maryland with 5 additional facilities being developed currently in Maryland and Massachusetts, while assisting clients to develop additional licensed facilities in other state licensed programs.
 
Alliances
 
The Company has entered into a licensing agreement with Tikun Olam USA, the first developer of medical cannabis products in Israel. The agreement provides the Company with the ability to sublicense certain medical cannabis genetics developed in Israel to our Delaware client at its licensed facility.
 
The Company is currently expanding this relationship to develop programs in Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Illinois, although there is no assurance that this expansion will result in increased revenues for the Company.
 
Competition
 
The Company has a comprehensive suite of products and services for the cannabis industry. There are companies that provide some of these services and only a few others that provide the depth of such services in multiple states across the country. The emerging cannabis industry is growing at such a pace that there are more opportunities available than these businesses can support. With plenty of business for all, our Company at times works with others to insure a positive image in new and emerging states. Many forget that it is the black market and illegal cannabis traffickers that controlled this business from the shadows and is the competition that is in a downward spiral.
