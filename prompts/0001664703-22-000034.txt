ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Overview
Our mission is to make clean, reliable energy affordable for everyone in the world. We created the first large-scale, commercially viable solid oxide fuel-cell based power generation platform that empowers businesses, essential services, critical infrastructure and communities to responsibly take charge of their energy.
Our technology, invented in the United States, is one of the most advanced electricity and hydrogen producing technologies on the market today. Our fuel-flexible Bloom Energy Servers can use biogas, hydrogen, natural gas, or a blend of fuels to create resilient, sustainable and cost-predictable power at significantly higher efficiencies than traditional, combustion-based resources. In addition, our same solid oxide platform that powers our fuel cells can be used to create hydrogen, which is increasingly recognized as a critically important tool necessary for the full decarbonization of the energy economy. Our enterprise customers include some of the largest multinational corporations in the world. We also have strong relationships with some of the largest utility companies in the United States and the Republic of Korea. 
At Bloom Energy, we look forward to a net-zero future. Our technology is designed to help enable this future in order to deliver reliable, low-carbon, electricity in a world facing unacceptable levels of power disruptions. Our resilient platform has kept electricity available for our customers through hurricanes, earthquakes, typhoons, forest fires, extreme heat and grid failures. Unlike traditional combustion power generation, our platform is community-friendly and designed to significantly reduce emissions of criteria air pollutants. We have made tremendous progress making renewable fuel production a reality through our biogas, hydrogen and electrolyzer programs, and we believe that we are well-positioned as a core platform and fixture in the new energy paradigm to help organizations and communities achieve their net-zero objectives.
Our team has decades of experience in the various specialized disciplines and systems engineering concepts embedded in our technology. We have 287 issued patents in the United States and 147 issued patents internationally as of December 31, 2021.
The United States is currently our biggest market and represents our largest installed base of Bloom Energy Servers. Some of our largest customers in the United States include AT&T, Caltech, Delmarva Power & Light Company, Equinix, The Home Depot, Kaiser Permanente and The Wonderful Company. We also work with a number of U.S. financing partners who purchase and deploy our systems at end-customers’ facilities in order to provide “electricity-as-a service."
Outside of the United States, the Republic of Korea is a world leader in the deployment of fuel cells for utility-scale electric power generation. We entered this market with a first deployment of an 8.35-megawatt ("MW") Bloom Energy Server solution for a Korean utility that began commercial operation in 2018. The Republic of Korea now represents our second-largest market. SK ecoplant Co., Ltd. (“SK ecoplant,” formerly known as SK Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd.), a subsidiary of the SK Group, serves as the primary distributor of our systems in the Republic of Korea. In October 2021, we announced an expansion of our existing partnership with SK ecoplant, that includes purchase commitments of at least 500MW of power for our Energy Servers between 2022 and 2025 on a take or pay basis, the creation of hydrogen innovation centers in the United States and the Republic of Korea to advance green hydrogen commercialization, and an equity investment in Bloom Energy.
We are also operating smaller deployments in India and Japan with commercial customers, with additional projects in development in Europe, Southeast Asia and Australia.
Industry Background
There are numerous challenges facing the traditional system for producing and delivering electricity. We believe these challenges will be the foundation of a transformation in how electricity is produced, delivered and consumed. We believe this transformation will be similar to the seismic shifts seen in the computer and telecommunications industries, where centralized mainframe computing and landline telephone systems ultimately gave way to the ubiquitous and highly personalized distributed technologies seen today, as well as the reimagining of business processes, culture and customer experiences.
Resilience is now a strategic imperative. The rising frequency and intensity of natural disasters and extreme weather in recent years underscores a critical need for greater grid resilience. 2021 was characterized by increasing, frequent and costly extreme weather events. In the United States alone, there were 20 weather/climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each. These events included droughts, flooding, tropical cyclones, tsunamis, wildfires and winter storms, resulting in 

Index to Financial Statements

billions of dollars in economic impact. 2021 was also the seventh consecutive year with 10 or more billion dollar climate-related events in the United States. Extreme weather’s economic toll is rising as well. The total cost of 2021’s billion dollar weather events is estimated at $145 billion, the third most costly year on record, while the total cost for the last five years exceeds one-third of the total disaster cost of the last 42 years.
Stakeholders across industries grapple with the question of how to prepare for more intense natural disasters while maintaining course toward achieving their climate targets. These climate threats are compounded by an increasing concern over the threat of cyber-attacks and physical sabotage to the centralized grid infrastructure. These acute issues further add to a chronic concern; the fragility of decades-old energy system elements that have suffered from deferred maintenance and replacement, which can only be partially remedied by the billions of dollars of new investment from the recently passed infrastructure bill. In an increasingly electrified world, from electric vehicles, to automated manufacturing, to the digitalization of everything, power supply and reliability are more important now than ever. This has elevated the discussion around the essential role that distributed generation and microgrids can play in improving the resilience of both businesses and the grid. As outages increase, businesses are considering the “cost of not having power” instead of just the “cost of power.” Energy resilience is becoming an issue business leaders can no longer afford to neglect – both from a strategic and cost perspective.
Rise in centralized capacity constraints. The traditional centralized grid model is increasingly showing weaknesses. For example, in the summer of 2021, California issued an emergency proclamation order, documenting the drastic measures that must be taken to secure sufficient capacity to be able to avert catastrophic blackouts. Californians were asked to conserve energy, customers with diesel generators were being asked to run them and the state suspended many environmental permitting rules and regulations related to the deployment of power generation. This is one of the many reasons why microgrids, localized energy systems that can operate alongside a main grid or disconnect and operate autonomously, are playing an increasingly important role, providing a critical, twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week ("24x7"), always-on energy solution, powering critical infrastructure, offsetting demand on the grid, and supplying power to the grid when it is most needed.
Increasing focus on reducing harmful local emissions. Air pollution is the fifth leading risk factor for mortality worldwide. Indeed, calculations of the economic and health benefits associated with reducing localized air pollution such as nitrogen oxides, which are produced by combusting fuel, and particulate matter emissions have been found to exceed the economic and health benefits of reducing carbon emissions. And, unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has only further shed light on these detrimental health impacts. Recent studies have linked long-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 death rates. They have also found that, nationwide, low-income communities of color are exposed to significantly higher levels of pollution, experiencing higher levels of lung disease and other ailments as a result. Policymakers are rightly increasing the emphasis on reducing such harmful local emissions as they consider the adoption of Renewable Portfolio Standards (“RPS”) or other mandated targets for low- or zero-carbon power generation.
Hydrogen is key to a zero-carbon future. We believe hydrogen will be a critical foundation for the energy industry of the future, a truly clean alternative for both natural gas and transportation fuels. Hydrogen’s unique advantages – high energy density, zero carbon gas emissions from consumption, and ease of storage and transportation – make it an especially attractive investment opportunity for those interested in a zero-carbon energy mix. Given the well-documented challenges that utilities and grid operators have faced as they integrate increasingly intermittent renewable resources on the grid, predictable round-the-clock hydrogen power will be an invaluable resource as more grids move towards a truly zero-carbon resource mix. The key limiting factor in the use of hydrogen, which does not readily exist in nature as a separate molecule, is that it cannot be mined, extracted or otherwise produced in its desired state without a manufacturing process. As both transportation and the electricity sector transition to a zero-carbon future, there will thus be increasing demand for both technologies that can efficiently generate power using hydrogen, and for large-scale electrolysis or carbon capture technology that can produce clean hydrogen at scale.
Our Solutions
We were the first company to successfully commercialize and scale the solid oxide platform. Our platform delivers distributed electricity and hydrogen generation through our stationary fuel cells, our solid oxide electrolyzer and our marine technology.
Distributed electricity production. Our stationary fuel cell solution, the Bloom Energy Server, is designed to deliver reliable, resilient, clean and affordable energy for utilities and organizations alike. Ideally suited for microgrid and primary power applications, the Bloom Energy Server is based on our proprietary solid oxide technology that converts fuel, such as natural gas, biogas, hydrogen, or a blend of these fuels, into electricity through an electrochemical process without combustion. The high-quality electrical output of our Energy Server can be connected to the customer’s main electrical feed, thereby avoiding the transmission and distribution losses associated with a centralized grid system. Each Bloom Energy Server is 

Index to Financial Statements

modular and composed of independent 50-kilowatt power modules. A typical configuration includes multiple power modules in a single Energy Server and can produce up to 300 kilowatts of power in a footprint roughly equivalent to that of a standard parking space. Any number of these Energy Server systems can be clustered together in various configurations to form solutions from hundreds of kilowatts to many tens of megawatts. The Bloom Energy Server can be easily integrated into community environments due to its aesthetically attractive design, compact space requirement, minimal noise profile and lack of criteria air pollutants.
Hydrogen generation. We believe we are uniquely positioned for the hydrogen future of tomorrow. Using the same solid oxide platform as our Energy Server, the Bloom Electrolyzer is designed to produce scalable and cost-effective hydrogen solutions. Our modular design makes the Bloom Electrolyzer ideal for applications across gas, utilities, nuclear, concentrated solar, ammonia and heavy industries. Our solid oxide, high-temperature electrolyzer is designed to produce hydrogen onsite more efficiently than low-temperature PEM and alkaline electrolyzers. Because it operates at high temperatures, the Bloom Electrolyzer is designed to require less energy to break up water molecules and produce hydrogen. As electricity accounts for nearly 80 percent of the cost of hydrogen from electrolysis, using less electricity increases the economics of hydrogen production and helps bolster adoption. The Bloom Electrolyzer is designed to produce green hydrogen from 100 percent renewable power. Using less electricity increases the economics of hydrogen production and helps bolster adoption. The hydrogen produced onsite at a customer’s facility can either be used as a fuel source or stored for consumption at a later point. 
Marine Transportation. We have also adapted our fuel cell technology to advance the decarbonization of the marine industry through the design and development of fuel cell powered ships. The marine sector is a significant source of global pollution, as many ships continue to use carbon-rich fuels such as bunker fuel, diesel, and other hydrocarbons. As global infrastructure for hydrogen and other emission-free fuels continue to develop, our modular, fuel-flexible and upgradable platform is designed to allow for existing ships in service to be upgraded, allowing the marine sector long-term flexibility and scalability for improved, future-proof, ship design. Furthermore, noise pollution and mechanical vibrations are substantially reduced when Bloom’s fuel cells are used as a power source aboard ships. Our platform is IMO 2040- and 2050-ready today, with the ability to operate on liquefied natural gas, biogas and blended hydrogen. We are committed to developing the platform to accommodate multiple renewable fuels, like green methanol and bio-ethanol, as the marine fuel market develops.
Our Value Proposition
Our energy platform has three key value propositions: resiliency, sustainability and predictability. We seek to provide a complete, integrated “behind-the-meter” solution including installation, equipment, service, maintenance and, in limited cases, bundled fuel. The three elements of our value proposition emphasize those areas where there is a strong customer need and where we believe we can deliver superior performance.
Resiliency. Our Energy Servers avoid the vulnerabilities of conventional transmission and distribution lines by generating power on-site where the electricity is consumed. The system operates at very high availability due to its modular and fault-tolerant design, which includes multiple independent power generation modules that can be hot-swapped to provide uninterrupted service. Unlike traditional combustion generation, Bloom Energy Servers can be serviced and maintained without powering down the system. Importantly, Bloom Energy Servers that utilize existing natural gas infrastructure rely on a redundant underground mesh network, intended to provide for extremely high fuel availability that is protected from the natural disasters that often disrupt the power grid.
Sustainability. Our Energy Servers uniquely address both the causes and consequences of climate change. Our projects lower carbon emissions by displacing less-efficient fossil fuel generation on the grid, which improves air quality, including in vulnerable communities, by generating electricity without combustion, offsetting combustion from grid resources as well as eliminating the need for dirtier diesel backup power solutions. Our microgrid deployments provide customers with critical resilience to grid instability, including disruptions resulting from climate-related extreme weather events. Our products achieve this while consuming no water during operation, with optimized land use as a result of our high-power density.
We are focused on product innovation, including the continued reduction of carbon emissions from our products, and we are engaged in multiple efforts to align our product roadmap with a zero-carbon trajectory. We are developing new applications and market opportunities in sectors with dirtier grids and higher marginal emissions displacement. In July 2021, we announced that we will convert our entire global natural gas fleet to certified low-leak natural gas to reduce the release of harmful methane emissions stemming from upstream gas production. We are also focused on scaling use of renewable natural gas (“RNG”) – which is pipeline quality natural gas derived from biogas produced from decomposing organic waste, generally from landfills, agricultural waste and wastewater treatment facilities – as fuel for our Energy Servers and building capacity within the RNG market to broaden adoption.

Additionally, we are pushing technology and business model boundaries to pioneer carbon capture and utilization and storage potential. It is both more feasible and cost-effective to capture carbon-dioxide emissions from our Energy Servers than from combustion generation, as no costly and complex separation of other gases like nitrogen is required. Captured carbon-dioxide emissions can be stored in underground geologic formations or utilized in new products or processes. 
We continue to progress on our development and commercialization of scalable and cost-effective 100 percent hydrogen solutions and zero emission power generation. Our flexible and modular platform approach allows for customization at the time of equipment commissioning and a pathway to upgrade existing systems to align with the sustainability goals of our customers over time. In 2021, we announced the commercial availability of our hydrogen-powered fuel cells and electrolyzers capable of producing clean hydrogen. Our 100 kilowatt hydrogen-powered Energy Server project in the Republic of Korea commenced operations in April 2021 and our electrolyzer project has been successfully installed and began producing hydrogen in January 2022.
Finally, we continue to leverage our platform in innovative ways, including collaborating with the Department of Energy's Idaho National Lab to efficiently create clean hydrogen using our electrolyzer and excess nuclear energy; generating green hydrogen by integrating our electrolyzer with Heliogen’s concentrated solar energy system; and working with others to find uses of our products in the hydrogen economy.
Predictability. In contrast to the rising and unpredictable cost outlook for grid electricity, we offer our customers the ability to lock in cost for electric power over the long-term. Unlike the grid price of electricity, which reflects the cost to maintain and update the entire transmission and distribution system, our price to our customers is based solely on their individual project. In the regions where the majority of our Energy Servers are deployed, our solution typically provides electricity to our customers at a cost that is competitive with traditional grid power prices. In addition, our solution provides greater cost predictability versus rising grid prices. Whereas grid prices are regulated and subject to frequent change based on the utility’s underlying costs, customers can contract with us for a known price in each year of their contract. Moreover, we provide customers with a solution that offers all of the fixed equipment and maintenance costs for the life of the contract.
Our Energy Servers are designed to deliver 24x7 power with very high availability, mission-critical reliability and grid-independent capabilities. The Bloom Energy Server can be configured to eliminate the need for traditional backup power equipment such as diesel generators, batteries and uninterruptible power systems by providing primary power to a facility that seamlessly continues to deliver power even when the grid fails. Our Energy Servers are designed to offer consistent power quality supply for mission critical operations that require a high level of electrical reliability and uninterrupted availability, such as data centers, hospitals, and biotechnology facilities. This is particularly important as society becomes more reliant on digital systems and sophisticated operational technology. Power quality issues can cause equipment failure, downtime, data corruption and increased operational costs
Further, our Energy Servers were designed to provide ‘quick time to power’– the ability to be deployed and begin generating power in as little as days or weeks – as an important value proposition for customers that need to ramp up power quickly. This capability is ideal for customers who need critical power but are facing utility capacity constraints, delays or additional costs. The modularity, quick deployment, ease of installation and small footprint of our Energy Servers facilitate ease of accessibility to power.
Our Energy Server can be enhanced with microgrid components to deliver higher levels of reliability and grid-independent operation. Customers can optimize their solution for mission-critical level, power quality solutions, such as in a data center application, to more basic outage protection, such as for a retail store. Customers also have a variety of choices for financing vehicles, contract duration, pricing schedules and fuel procurement.
Technology
Our solid oxide technology platform is the foundation for both our Energy Servers and our Bloom Electrolyzer. The solid-oxide fuel cells in our Energy Servers convert fuel, such as natural gas, biogas, hydrogen, or a blend of fuels into electricity through an electrochemical reaction without burning the fuel. Each individual fuel cell is composed of three layers: an electrolyte sandwiched between a cathode and an anode. The electrolyte is a solid ceramic material, and the anode and cathode are made from inks that coat the electrolyte. Unlike other types of fuel cells, no precious metals, corrosive acids or molten materials are required. These fuel cells are the foundational building block of our Energy Server. Regardless of the starting size of a solution, further scaling can be accomplished after the initial solution deployment, creating ongoing flexibility and scalability for the customer.

Our electrolyzer technology dates to the 1980s, when our co-founders first developed electrolyzers to support the U.S. military and later NASA’s Mars exploration programs. In the early 2000s, 19 patents were awarded to Bloom Energy for its electrolyzer technology. With reduced renewable energy costs and the global movement to decarbonize, we believe it is the right moment to commercialize our hydrogen technology. The Bloom Electrolyzer is based on our solid oxide technology, and is designed to generate hydrogen from electricity at superior efficiencies compared to PEM and alkaline solutions. Our electrolyzer advances decarbonization efforts by providing a clean fuel for carbon-free generation, injection into the natural gas pipeline, transportation, or for use in industrial processes. Because it operates at high temperatures, the Bloom Electrolyzer requires less energy to break up water molecules and produce hydrogen.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization has addressed complex applied materials, processing and packaging challenges through the invention of many proprietary advanced material science solutions. Over more than a decade, Bloom has built a world-class team of solid oxide fuel cell scientists and technology experts. Our team comprises technologists with degrees in Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering and Nuclear Engineering, and includes 43 PhDs within these or related fields. This team has continued to develop innovative technology improvements for our Energy Servers. Since our first-generation technology, we have reduced the costs and increased the output of our systems through the next generation of our Energy Servers and increased the life of our fuel cells by over two and half times.
We have invested and will continue to invest a significant amount in research and development. See our discussion of research and development expenses in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Competition
We primarily compete against gas engines, combined heat and power systems, and the utility grid with diesel back-up, based on superior reliability, resiliency, cost savings, predictability and sustainability, all of which can be customized to the needs of individual customers. Customers do not currently have alternative solutions that provide all of these important attributes in one platform. As we drive our costs down and make technological improvements, we expect our value proposition to continue to improve relative to grid power in additional markets.
Other sources of competition – and the attributes that differentiate us – include:
•Intermittent solar power paired with storage. Solar power is intermittent and best suited for addressing day-time peak power requirements, while our Energy Servers are designed to provide stable baseload generation. Storage technology is intended to address the intermittency of solar power, but the low power density of the combined technologies and the challenges of extended poor weather events that sharply decrease solar power production and battery recharging makes the solution impractical for most commercial and industrial customers looking to offset a significant amount of power. As a point of comparison, our Energy Servers provide the same power output in 1/125th of the footprint of a photovoltaic solar installation, allowing us to serve far more of a customer’s energy requirements based on a customer’s available and typically limited space.
•Intermittent wind power. Power from wind turbines is intermittent, similar to solar power. Typically, wind power is deployed for utility-side, grid-scale applications in remote locations but not as a customer-side, distributed power alternative due to prohibitive space requirements and permitting issues. Where distributed wind power is available, it can be combined with storage, with similar benefits and challenges to solar-and-storage combinations. Remote wind farms feeding into the grid do not help end customers avoid the vulnerabilities and costs of the transmission and distribution system.
•Traditional co-generation systems. These systems deliver a combination of electric power and heat from combustion sources. We believe we compete favorably because of our non-combustion platform, superior electrical efficiencies, significantly less complex deployment (avoiding heating systems integration and requiring less space), superior availability, aesthetic appeal and reliability. Unlike these systems, which depend on the full and concurrent utilization of waste heat to achieve high efficiencies, we can provide highly efficient systems to any customer based solely on their power needs.
•Traditional backup equipment. As our Energy Servers deliver reliable power, particularly in microgrid configurations where our Energy Servers can operate during grid outages, they can obviate the need for traditional backup equipment 

Index to Financial Statements

such as diesel generators. By providing combustion-free power 24x7 rather than just as backup, we generally offer a better integrated, more reliable, cleaner and cost-effective solution than these grid-plus-backup systems.
•Other commercially available fuel cells. Basic fuel cell technology is over 100 years old. Our Energy Server uses advanced solid oxide fuel cell technology, which produces electricity directly from oxidizing a fuel. The type of solid oxide fuel cell we compete against has a solid oxide or ceramic electrolyte. The advantages of our technology include higher efficiency, long-term stability, elimination of the need for an external fuel reformer, ability to use biogas, natural gas, or hydrogen as a fuel, low emissions and relatively low cost. There are a variety of fuel cell technologies, characterized by their electrolyte material, including:
◦Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (“PEM”). PEM fuel cells typically are used in onboard transportation applications, such as powering forklifts, because of their compactness and ability for quick starts and stops. However, PEM technology requires an expensive platinum catalyst, which is susceptible to poisoning by trace amounts of impurities in the fuel or exhaust products. These fuel cells require high cost fuel input sources of energy or an external fuel reformer, which adds to the cost, complexity and electrical inefficiency of the product. As a result, they are not typically an economically viable option for stationary baseload power generation.
◦Molten carbonate fuel cells (“MCFC”). MCFCs are high-temperature fuel cells that use an electrolyte composed of a molten carbonate salt mixture suspended in a porous, chemically inert ceramic matrix of beta-alumina solid electrolyte. The primary disadvantages of current MCFC technology are durability and lower electrical efficiency compared to solid oxide fuel cells. Current versions of the product are built for 300 kilowatt systems, and they are monolithic rather than modular. Smaller sizes are typically not economically viable. In many applications where the heat produced by these fuel cells is not commercially or internally useable continuously, mitigating the heat buildup also becomes a liability.
◦Phosphoric acid fuel cells (“PAFC”). PAFCs are a type of fuel cell that uses liquid phosphoric acid as an electrolyte. Developed in the mid-1960s and field-tested since the 1970s, they were the first fuel cells to be commercialized. PAFCs have been used for stationary power generators with output in the 100 kilowatt to 400 kilowatt range. PAFCs are best suited to combined heat and power output applications that require carefully matching and constant monitoring of power and heat requirements (heat is typically not required all year long thus significant efficiency is lost), often making the technology difficult to implement. Further, disadvantages include low power density and poor system output stability.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an essential differentiator for our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property whenever possible. We rely upon a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademark laws, along with employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
We have developed a significant patent portfolio to protect elements of our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2021, we had 287 issued patents and 96 patent applications pending in the United States, and we had an international patent portfolio comprising 147 issued patents and 80 patent applications pending. Our U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2023 and 2040. While patents are an important element of our intellectual property strategy, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or any single pending patent application. 
We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in some locations abroad. “Bloom Energy” and the “BE” logo are our registered trademarks in certain countries for use with Energy Servers and our other products. We also hold registered trademarks for, among others, “Bloom Box,” “BloomConnect,” “BloomEnergy,” and “Energy Server” in certain countries. In an effort to protect our brand, as of December 31, 2021, we had eight registered trademarks in the United States, 40 registered trademarks in Australia, China, the European Union, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and two pending applications in China. 
When appropriate, we enforce our intellectual property rights against other parties. For more information about risks related to our intellectual property, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.
Manufacturing Facilities

Index to Financial Statements

Our primary manufacturing facilities for fuel cells and Energy Servers assembly are in Sunnyvale, California, Fremont, California, and Newark, Delaware. We own our 76,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Newark, which was our first purpose-built Bloom Energy manufacturing center and was designed specifically for copy-exact duplication as we expand, which we believe will help us scale more efficiently. Our Newark facility includes an additional 25 acres available for factory expansion and/or the co-location of supplier plants. We lease various manufacturing facilities in California. The current lease for our 50,000 square-foot principal Sunnyvale manufacturing facility expires in December 2023. We leased a new 89,000 square-foot R&D and manufacturing facility in Fremont, California that became operational in April 2021. Additionally, we leased a new 164,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Fremont, California that became operational in January 2022. 
In 2020, we established a light-assembly facility in the Republic of Korea, in connection with our efforts to develop a local supplier ecosystem through a joint venture with SK ecoplant. Operations began in early July 2020.
Please see Part I, Item 2, Properties for additional information regarding our facilities.
Supply Chain
Our supply chain has been developed, since our founding, with a group of high-quality suppliers that support automotive, semiconductor and other traditional manufacturing organizations. The production of fuel cell systems requires rare earth elements, precious metals, scarce alloys and industrial commodities. Our operations require raw materials, and in certain cases, third-party services that require special manufacturing processes. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services except in cases where we have specialized technology and material property requirements. Our supply base is spread around many geographies in Asia, Europe and India, consisting of suppliers with multiple areas of expertise in compaction, sintering, brazing and dealing with specialty material manufacturing techniques. That where possible, we responsibly source components like interconnects and balance of system components from various manufacturers on both a contracted and a purchase order basis. We have multi-year supply agreements with some of our supply partners for supply continuity and pricing stability. We are working with our suppliers and partners along all steps of the value chain to reduce costs by improving manufacturing technologies and expanding economies of scale.
There have been a number of disruptions throughout the global supply chain as the global economy opens up and drives demand for certain components that has outpaced the return of the global supply chain to full production. We continued to manage disruptions from an increase in lead times for most of our components due to a variety of factors, including supply shortages, shipping delays and labor shortages, and we expect this to continue into the first half of 2022. During 2021, we experienced delays from certain vendors and suppliers as a result of these factors, although we were able to mitigate the impact so that we did not experience delays in the manufacture of our Energy Servers and only one instance of a significant delay in the installation of our Energy Servers. For additional information on our supply chain, please see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – COVID-19 Pandemic.
Services
We provide operations and maintenance agreements ("O&M Agreements") for all of our Energy Servers, which are renewable at the election of the customer on an annual basis. The customer agrees to pay an ongoing service fee and in return we monitor, maintain and operate the Energy Servers systems on the customer's behalf. We currently service and maintain every installed Bloom Server worldwide.
As of December 31, 2021, our in-house service organization had 78 dedicated field service personnel distributed across multiple locations in both the United States and internationally. Our standard O&M Agreements include full remote monitoring and 24x7 operation of the systems as well as preventative maintenance, in terms of filter and adsorbents replacements and on-site part and periodic fuel cell module replacements.
Our two Remote Monitoring and Control Centers (“RMCC”) provide 24x7 coverage of every installed Bloom Energy Server worldwide. By situating our RMCC centers in the United States and India we are able to provide 24x7 coverage cost effectively and also provide a dual redundant system with either site able to operate continuously should an issue arise. Each Bloom Energy Server we ship includes instrumentation and a secure telemetry connection that enables either RMCC to monitor over 500 system performance parameters real time. This comprehensive monitoring capability enables the RMCC operators to have a detailed understanding of the internal operation of our power modules. Using proprietary, internally developed software, the RMCC operators can detect changes and override the onboard automated control systems to remotely adjust parameters to ensure the optimum system performance is maintained. In addition, we undertake advanced predictive analytics to identify potential issues before they arise and undertake adjustments prior to a failure occurring.

Our services organization also has a dedicated Repair & Overhaul ("R&O") facility, based in Delaware, in close proximity to our product manufacturing facility. This R&O facility undertakes full refurbishment of returned fuel cell modules with the capability to restore it to full power, efficiency and life with a less than three weeks turnaround. This close proximity to our Delaware manufacturing facility enables us to review the condition of returned modules and inform improved manufacturing processes.
Purchase and Financing Options
In order to appeal to the largest variety of customers, we make available several options to our customers. Both in the United States and abroad, we sell Energy Servers directly to customers. In the United States, we also enable customers' use of the Energy Servers through a pay as you go offering, made possible through third-party ownership financing arrangements.
Often our offerings take advantage of local incentives. In the United States, our financing arrangements are structured to optimize both federal and local incentives, including the Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) and accelerated depreciation. Internationally, our sales are made primarily to distributors who on-sell to, and install for, customers; these deals are also structured to use local incentives applicable to our Energy Servers. Increasingly, we use trusted installers and other sourcing collaborations in the United States to generate transactions.
With respect to the third-party financing options in the United States, a customer may choose a contract for the use Energy Servers in exchange for a capacity-based flat payment (a “Managed Services Agreement”) or one for the purchase of electricity generated by the Energy Servers in exchange for a scheduled dollars per kilowatt hour rate (a “Power Purchase Agreement” or “PPA”).
Certain customer payments in a Managed Services Agreement are required regardless of the level of performance of the Energy Server; in some cases it may also include a variable payment based on the Energy Server's performance or a performance-related set-off. Managed Services Agreements are then financed pursuant to a sale-leaseback with a financial institution (a “Managed Services Financing”).
PPAs are typically financed on a portfolio basis. We have financed portfolios through tax equity partnerships, acquisition financings and direct sales to investors (each, a “Portfolio Financing”).
For additional information about our different financing options, please see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Purchase and Financing Options.
Sales, Marketing and Partnerships
We sell our Energy Server platform through a combination of direct and indirect sales channels. At present, most of our U.S. sales are through our direct sales force, which is segmented by vertical and type of account. A large part of our direct sales force is now focused on our expansion efforts in the United States and creating new opportunities internationally. We are also expanding our relationship with utilities. We have developed a network of strategic energy advisors that originate new opportunities and referrals to Bloom Energy, which has been a valuable source of high-quality leads.
We pursue relationships with other companies and partners in areas where collaboration can produce product advancement and acceleration of entry into new geographic and vertical markets. The objectives and goals of these relationships can include one or more of the following: technology exchange, joint sales and marketing, or access to new geographic markets. SK ecoplant in the Republic of Korea is a strategic power generation and distribution partner. Together, we have transacted nearly 200 MW of projects totaling more than $1.8 billion of equipment and expected service revenue.

Sustainability
As a manufacturer, our commitment to sustainability is reflected not only through the impacts of our products in operation but also through our internal commitment to resource efficiency, responsible design, materials management and recycling. We endeavor to consistently increase our supply chain responsibility and approach to human capital management in ways that help us to continue to deliver products that add long-term societal value.
We are driven by the promise of our contribution to the transformation and decarbonization of energy and transportation sectors globally. We are working to make our technology available across a growing list of applications including biogas, carbon capture, hydrogen, marine and microgrid projects critical to aligning with a two-degree warming trajectory.
Bloom Energy Servers produce clean, reliable energy without combustion that provide greenhouse gas, air quality, water, land-use and resilience benefits for customers and the communities they serve. The Bloom Electrolyzer is designed to utilize the same solid oxide technology platform in a highly efficient and cost-effective hydrogen production process. Our innovative solid oxide fuel cell platform technology offers modular and flexible solutions configurable to address both the causes and consequences of climate change.
Our Energy Servers withdraw water only during start-up and if the system needs to restart. Otherwise, Energy Servers use no water during operation, avoiding water withdrawals of more than 18,000 gallons per megawatt hour. Conversely, thermal power plants require significant amounts of water for cooling. In fact, the number one use of water in the United States is for cooling power plants. To produce one megawatt per hour for a year, thermoelectric power generation for the U.S. grid withdraws approximately 156 million gallons of water more than our platform. 
We are focused on energy efficiency in our production and administrative processes, and have introduced a significant amount of energy-efficient plant automation over the last several years. Our own Energy Servers power our facilities, where suitable, as efficient and resilient energy sources. We also use our Energy Servers to charge employee vehicles at manufacturing facility locations, and as we broaden the integration of our Energy Servers across our real estate portfolio, we will continue to support our employees with lower carbon intensity and resilient onsite electric vehicle charging.
We take a cradle-to-grave perspective on product design and use. We strive to reuse components and recoverable materials where feasible and use conflict-free, non-toxic new resources where needed. We design our equipment so that components can be easily refurbished as needed instead of requiring new equipment. Finally, we cover as many materials and components as possible during end-of-life management, reusing these materials and components. As a function of an approximately 30,000-pound Bloom Energy Server, the weight of components that go to the landfill without a recycling or refurbishment stream comprises approximately 510 pounds, or less than approximately 2% of the total server weight.
U.S. & Global Climate Issues
Global warming and resulting extreme weather are having significant economic, environmental and social impacts in the United States and around the world. These and anticipated future impacts have resulted in wide array of market and regulatory responses, and will continue to do so. Our business can be impacted by climate change, and by those market and regulatory responses, in a variety of ways. We closely follow the impacts of climate change on the energy system and its customers, as well as the regulatory, policy and voluntary measures taken in response to those impacts, so that we may understand and respond to changing conditions that may affect our company, our customers, and our investors and business partners. We are responsive to the recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD"), as well as disclosure guidance from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”). We issued our first TCFD and SASB aligned Sustainability Report in 2021, and plan to follow up with another aligned report in 2022.
The direct impacts of climate change on energy systems, including the increased risk they pose to energy service disruption, may provide increased opportunity for our extremely reliable and resilient energy generation. New or more stringent international accords, national or state legislation, or regulation of greenhouse gas emission may increase demand for our bioenergy and hydrogen-based products, but they may also make it more expensive or impractical to deploy natural gas-fueled Energy Servers in some markets notwithstanding their enhanced environmental performance relative to combustion-based technologies, or may cause the loss of regulatory or policy incentives for those deployments. Examples include an anticipated greenhouse gas standard for participation in favorable fuel cell tariffs under consideration in California, new climate emissions restrictions or the introduction of carbon pricing, and the adoption of bans or restrictions on new natural gas interconnections by some local jurisdictions. For more on climate and environmental related risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors – Risks Related to Legal Matters and Regulations.

Permits and Approvals
Each Bloom Energy Server installation must be designed, constructed and operated in compliance with applicable federal, state, international and local regulations, codes, standards, guidelines, policies and laws. To operate our systems, we, our customers and our partners are required to obtain applicable permits and approvals from federal, state and local authorities for the installation of Bloom Energy Servers and the Bloom Electrolyzer and for the interconnection systems with the local electrical utility and, where the gas distribution system is used, the gas utility as well.
Government Policies and Incentives
There are varying policy frameworks across the United States and abroad designed to support and accelerate the adoption of clean and/or reliable distributed power generation and hydrogen technologies such as Bloom Energy Servers and the Bloom Electrolyzer. These policy initiatives come in the form of tax incentives, cash grants, performance incentives, environmental attribute credits, permitting regimes, interconnection policies and/or applicable gas or electric tariffs.
The U.S. federal government provides businesses with an ITC under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code, available to the owner of our Energy Server for systems purchased and placed into service. The credit is equal to 26 percent of expenditures for capital equipment and installation, and the credit for fuel cells is capped at $1,500 per 0.5 kilowatt of capacity. The credit will remain at 26 percent through 2022 and then step down to 22 percent in 2023. Under current law the credit is set to expire in 2024.
Our Energy Servers are currently installed at customer sites in eleven states in the United States, each of which has its own enabling policy framework. Some states have utility procurement programs and/or renewables portfolio standards for which our technology is eligible. Our Energy Servers currently qualify for tax exemptions, incentives or other customer incentives in many states including California, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maryland and New York. These policy provisions are subject to change.
Government Regulations
Our business is subject to a changing patchwork of energy and environmental laws and regulations that prevail at the federal, state, regional and local level as well as in those foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Most existing energy and environmental laws and regulations preceded the introduction of our innovative fuel cell technology and were adopted to apply to technologies existing at the time, namely large coal, oil or gas-fired power plants, and more recently solar and wind plants.
Although we generally are not regulated as a utility, existing and future federal, state, international and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence the market for our product and services. These statutes and regulations often relate to electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, competition with utilities, the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation, interconnection to the gas distribution system, and other issues relevant to the deployment and operation of our products, as applicable. Federal, state, international and local governments continuously modify these statutes and regulations. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt or approve different requirements for regulated entities and rates for commercial customers on a regular basis. These changes can have a positive or negative impact on our ability to deliver cost savings to customers.
At the federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has authority to regulate, under various federal energy regulatory laws, wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity, and ancillary services, and the delivery of natural gas in interstate commerce. Some of our tax equity partnerships in which we participate are subject to regulation under FERC with respect to market-based sales of electricity, which requires us to file notices and make other periodic filings with FERC. In addition, our project with Delmarva Power & Light Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to electricity generation, transmission, and sale at the federal level and in Delaware. To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection agreements from the applicable local primary electricity and gas utilities. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the state or local public utility commission or other regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over interconnection agreements. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are typically required for deployment of our systems once interconnection agreements are signed, although they may be required for the export and subsequent sale of electricity or other regulated products.
Product safety standards for stationary fuel cell generators have been established by the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”). These standards are known as ANSI/CSA FC-1. Our products are designed to meet these standards. Further, we utilize the Underwriters' Laboratory, or UL, to certify compliance with these standards. Energy Server installation guidance 

Index to Financial Statements

is provided by NFPA 853: Standard for the Installation of Stationary Fuel Cell Power Systems. Installations at sites are carried out to meet the requirements of these standards.
Currently, there is generally little guidance from environmental agencies on whether or how certain environmental laws and regulations may apply to our technologies. These laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury, fines, and penalties. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties or third-party damages. In addition, maintaining compliance with applicable environmental laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act in the United States, requires significant time and management resources.
Several states in which we currently operate, including California, require permits for emissions of hazardous air pollutants based on the quantity of emissions, most of which require permits only for quantities of emissions that are higher than those observed from our Energy Servers. Other states in which we operate, including New York, New Jersey and North Carolina, have specific exemptions for fuel cells. 
For more information about the regulations to which we are subject and the risks to our costs and operations related thereto, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to Legal Matters and Regulations.
Backlog
The timing of delivery and installations of our products has a significant impact on the timing of the recognition of product and installation revenue. Many factors can cause a lag between the time a customer signs a purchase order and our recognition of product revenue. These factors include the number of Energy Servers installed per site, local permitting and utility requirements, environmental, health and safety requirements, weather, and customer facility construction schedules. Many of these factors are unpredictable and their resolution is often outside of our or our customers’ control. Customers may also ask us to delay an installation for reasons unrelated to the foregoing, including delays in their obtaining financing. Further, due to unexpected delays, deployments may require unanticipated expenses to expedite delivery of materials or labor to ensure the installation meets the timing objectives. These unexpected delays and expenses can be exacerbated in periods in which we deliver and install a larger number of smaller projects. In addition, if even relatively short delays occur, there may be a significant shortfall between the revenue we expect to generate in a particular period and the revenue that we are able to recognize. For our installations, revenue and cost of revenue can fluctuate significantly on a periodic basis depending on the timing of acceptance and the type of financing used by the customer.
See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Purchase and Financing Options – Delivery and Installation, for additional information on backlog.

encouraged to participate, and co-sponsoring mobile vaccinations in underserved communities. Employees are encouraged to participate in local volunteer activities.
Health, Safety and Wellness
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide and encourage proactive protection and to support their financial, physical and mental well-being by providing tools and resources accessible at or outside of work.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 and again in 2021, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This included having some of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for the 40% of our employees continuing critical on-site work in our manufacturing, installation and service organizations. For these populations, we have developed a robust program of on-site testing. Starting during the summer of 2021, we reopened our offices, with testing and vaccination requirements, but we continue to remain flexible and attentive to our employees concerns and safety.
Community Investment in 2021
The health and well-being of our people, communities and planet are paramount. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we were deemed an essential business. In collaboration with the University of Illinois and El Camino Health, we launched the University of Illinois’ Shield T3 COVID testing system and hosted a mobile laboratory at our facility in Sunnyvale. We have been powering and hosting the mobile lab to provide rapid testing for Bay Area organizations and schools.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our Energy Servers have been delivering power to facilities around the globe that are providing essential services. We have deployed more than 20,000 fuel cell modules since our first commercial shipments in 2009, sending power to hospitals, healthcare manufacturing facilities, biotechnology facilities, grocery stores, hardware stores, banks, telecom facilities and other critical infrastructure applications.
Our employees are mission-driven and passionately invest their time in support of our local communities. Our inaugural Bloom Energy Stars and Strides charity race in San Jose helped raise money for the Valley Medical Center Foundation in August 2021. In addition, our employees have helped tackle food insecurity by boxing 9,000 pounds of produce to feed 360 families in the Bay Area, mentored University of Delaware students to help them complete their senior design program, and organized holiday toy drives with Toys for Tots.
