Item 1. Business General
 Whiting USA Trust II (the “Trust”) is a statutory trust formed on December 5, 2011 under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, pursuant to a trust agreement (the “Trust agreement”) among Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation (“Whiting Oil and Gas”), as Trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the “Trustee”), and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Delaware Trustee (the “Delaware Trustee”). The initial capitalization of the Trust estate was funded by Whiting Petroleum Corporation (“Whiting”) on December 8, 2011. The Trust maintains its offices at the office of the Trustee, at 601 Travis Street, 16th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002. The telephone number of the Trustee is 512‑236‑6599.
 The Trust makes copies of its reports under the Exchange Act available at http://whitingwhz.investorhq.businesswire.com. The Trust’s filings under the Exchange Act are also available electronically from the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Trust will provide electronic and paper copies of its recent filings free of charge upon request to the Trustee.
 As of December 31, 2011, the Trust had no assets other than a de minimis cash balance from its initial capitalization and had conducted no operations other than organizational activities. In March 2012, the Trust issued 18,400,000 units of beneficial interest in the Trust (“Trust units”) to Whiting in exchange for the conveyance of the NPI by Whiting Oil and Gas. The NPI represents the right for the Trust to receive 90% of the net proceeds from Whiting’s interests in certain existing oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid producing properties which are referred to as “the underlying properties”. The underlying properties are located in the Permian Basin, Rocky Mountains, Gulf Coast and Mid‑Continent regions of the United States. The underlying properties include interests in 1,303 gross (367.8 net) producing oil and gas wells as of December 31, 2018. Whiting completed an initial public offering of Trust units selling all of its 18,400,000 units on March 28, 2012. The Trust units are currently traded on the OTC, operated by OTC Markets Group, under the trading symbol “WHZT”, but the Trust can provide no assurance that any trading market for the Trust units will exist on the OTC in the future or that current trading levels will be sustained or will not diminish.
 The Trust will wind up its affairs and terminate shortly after the earlier of (a) the NPI termination date, which is the later to occur of (1) December 31, 2021, or (2) the time when 11.79 MMBOE have been produced from the underlying properties and sold (which amount is the equivalent of 10.61 MMBOE in respect of the Trust’s right to receive 90% of the net proceeds from such reserves pursuant to the NPI), or (b) the sale of the net profits interest. After the termination of the Trust, it will pay no further distributions.
 As of December 31, 2018, on a cumulative accrual basis 8.97 MMBOE (85%) of the 10.61 MMBOE attributable to the NPI have been produced and sold or divested. Further detail on the reserves is provided herein under the section titled “Properties—Description of the Underlying Properties—Reserves”, and such reserve information is based upon a reserve report prepared by independent reserve engineers Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. for the underlying properties as of December 31, 2018, which is referred to as the “reserve report.” According to the reserve report, the portion of the 11.79 MMBOE (10.61 MMBOE at the 90% NPI) reserve quantities attributable to the NPI not yet produced and sold or divested as of December 31, 2018 is projected to be produced from the underlying properties prior to December 31, 2021, which reserve report is based on NYMEX oil and gas prices of $65.56 per Bbl and $3.10 per MMBtu, respectively, pursuant to current SEC and FASB guidelines and the other assumptions included therein. The average NYMEX oil and gas prices for the month of January 2019 were $51.55 per Bbl and $3.23 per MMBtu, respectively. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional discussion. Production from the underlying properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 82% oil and approximately 18% natural gas.
 Whiting entered into certain costless collar hedge contracts and in turn conveyed to the Trust the rights and obligations to hedge payments under such contracts. All such contracts terminated as of December 31, 2014, and no additional hedges are allowed to be placed on the Trust assets. Thus, there are no further cash settlements on commodity hedges, and the Trust therefore has increased exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility.
 Net proceeds payable to the Trust depend upon production quantities; sales prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; costs to develop and produce the oil and gas; and realized cash settlements from commodity derivative contracts. In calculating net proceeds, Whiting deducts from gross oil and natural gas sales proceeds, lease operating expenses (including costs of workovers), production and property taxes, development costs, hedge payments made by Whiting to the hedge contract counterparty, maintenance expenses, producing overhead (all such costs, “production and development costs”) and amounts that may be reserved for future development, maintenance or operating expenses (which reserve may not exceed $2.0 million at any time) as calculated on an aggregate basis for all these properties. If at any time production and development costs should exceed gross proceeds, neither the Trust nor the Trust 

 
  7

 
unitholders would be liable for the excess costs. The Trust, however, would not receive any net proceeds until future net proceeds exceed the total of those excess costs, plus interest at the prevailing money market rate. For more information on the net proceeds calculation, refer to “Computation of Net Proceeds” later in this section.
 The Trust makes quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its quarterly cash receipts, if any, after the deduction of fees and expenses for the administration of the Trust, to holders of its Trust units. Because payments to the Trust are generated by depleting assets and the Trust has a finite life due to the production from the underlying properties diminishing over time, a portion of each distribution represents a return of the original investment in the Trust units, with the remainder being considered as a return on investment. As a result, the market price of the Trust units will decline to zero at termination of the Trust.
 The Trustee can authorize the Trust to borrow money to pay Trust administrative or incidental expenses that exceed cash held by the Trust. The Trustee may authorize the Trust to borrow from the Trustee, Whiting or the Delaware Trustee as a lender, provided the terms of the loan are similar to the terms it would grant to a similarly situated commercial customer with whom it did not have a fiduciary relationship. The Trustee may also deposit funds awaiting distribution in an account with itself, which may be a non‑interest bearing account, and make other short‑term investments with the funds distributed to the Trust.
 The Trust was created to acquire and hold the NPI for the benefit of the Trust unitholders pursuant to the conveyance to the Trust from Whiting Oil and Gas. The NPI is the only asset of the Trust, other than cash reserves held for future Trust expenses. The NPI is passive in nature, and the Trustee has no management control over and no responsibility relating to the operation of the underlying properties. The business and affairs of the Trust are administered by the Trustee. Whiting and its affiliates have no ability to manage or influence the operations of the Trust. The oil and gas properties comprising the underlying properties for which Whiting is designated the operator are currently operated by Whiting and its subsidiaries on a contract operator basis. Whiting, as a matter of course, does not make public projections as to future sales, earnings or other results relating to the underlying properties.
 Marketing and Major Customers
 Pursuant to the terms of the conveyance creating the NPI, Whiting has the responsibility to market, or cause to be marketed, the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid production attributable to the underlying properties. The terms of the conveyance creating the NPI do not permit Whiting to charge any marketing fee, other than fees for marketing paid to non‑affiliates, when determining the net proceeds upon which the NPI is calculated. As a result, the net proceeds to the Trust from the sales of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid production from the underlying properties are determined based on the same price that Whiting receives for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid production attributable to Whiting’s remaining interest in the underlying properties.
 Whiting principally sells its oil and natural gas production to end users, marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline facilities. In areas where there is no practical access to pipelines, oil is trucked to storage facilities. Whiting’s marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond its control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted. The table below presents percentages by purchaser that accounted for 10% or more of the oil, NGL and natural gas sales attributable to the NPI for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
Plains Marketing, LP | 20% | 17% | 16% 
Chevron USA | 16% | 15% | 15% 
Merit Management Partners I, LP (previously Marathon Oil Corporation) | 13% | 14% | 9% 
Phillips 66 Company | 9% | 11% | 11% 

      Whiting does not believe that the potential loss of any of these purchasers presents a material risk because there is significant competition among purchasers of crude oil and natural gas in the areas of the underlying properties, and if the underlying properties were to lose any of their largest purchasers, several entities could reasonably be expected to purchase crude oil and natural gas produced from the underlying properties with little or no interruption to their sales.
 Competition and Markets
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. Whiting competes with major oil and gas companies and independent oil and gas companies for oil and natural gas, equipment, personnel and markets for the sale of oil and natural gas. Many of these competitors are financially stronger than Whiting, but even financially troubled competitors can affect the market because of their need to sell oil and natural gas at any price to attempt to maintain cash flow. The Trust is subject to the same competitive conditions as Whiting and other companies in the oil and natural gas industry.

 Oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil, natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas. Future price fluctuations for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids will directly impact Trust distributions, estimates of reserves attributable to the NPI and estimated and actual future net revenues to the Trust. In light of the many uncertainties that affect the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, neither the Trust nor Whiting can make reliable predictions of future oil and natural gas supply and demand, future product prices or the effect of future product prices on the Trust.
 Description of Trust Units
 Each Trust unit is a unit of beneficial interest in the Trust and is entitled to receive cash distributions from the Trust on a pro rata basis. Each Trust unitholder has the same rights regarding each of his or her Trust units as every other Trust unitholder has regarding his or her units. The Trust units are in book‑entry form only and are not represented by certificates. Periodic Reports
 The Trustee files all required Trust federal and state income tax and information returns. The Trustee prepares and makes available to Trust unitholders annual reports that Trust unitholders need to correctly report their share of the Trust’s income and deductions. The Trustee also causes to be prepared and filed reports required under the Exchange Act and by the rules of any securities exchange or quotation system on which the Trust units are listed or admitted to trading, and is responsible for causing the Trust to comply with all of the provisions of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002, including but not limited to, establishing, evaluating and maintaining a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 thereof. Each Trust unitholder and his or her representatives may examine, for any proper purpose, during reasonable business hours, the records of the Trust and the Trustee. Liability of Trust Unitholders
 Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, Trust unitholders are entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. No assurance can be given, however, that the courts in jurisdictions outside of Delaware would give effect to such limitation. Voting Rights of Trust Unitholders
 The Trustee or Trust unitholders owning at least 10% of the outstanding Trust units may call meetings of Trust unitholders. The Trust is responsible for all costs associated with calling a meeting of Trust unitholders, unless such meeting is called by the Trust unitholders, in which case the Trust unitholders are responsible for all costs associated with calling such meeting. Meetings must be held in such location as is designated by the Trustee in the notice of such meeting. The Trustee must send written notice of the time and place of the meeting and the matters to be acted upon to all of the Trust unitholders at least 20 days and not more than 60 days before the meeting. Trust unitholders representing a majority of Trust units outstanding must be present or represented to have a quorum. Each Trust unitholder is entitled to one vote for each Trust unit owned.
 Unless otherwise required by the Trust agreement, a matter may be approved or disapproved by the vote of a majority of the Trust units held by the Trust unitholders at a meeting where there is a quorum. This is true, even if a majority of the total Trust units did not approve it. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Trust units is required to:

· | dissolve the Trust;
--+--------------------


· | remove the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | amend the Trust agreement (except with respect to certain matters that do not adversely affect the rights of Trust unitholders in any material respect);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | merge or consolidate the Trust with or into another entity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | approve the sale of assets of the Trust unless the sale involves the release of less than or equal to 0.25% of the total production from the underlying properties for the last twelve months and the aggregate asset sales do not have a fair market value in excess of $1.0 million for the last twelve months; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | agree to amend or terminate the conveyance.
--+--------------------------------------------

  In addition, certain amendments to the Trust agreement, conveyance and administrative services agreement may be made by the Trustee without approval of the Trust unitholders.

 Termination of the Trust; Sale of the Net Profits Interest
 The Trust will wind up its affairs and terminate shortly after the earlier of (a) the NPI termination date, which is the later to occur of (1) December 31, 2021, or (2) the time when 11.79 MMBOE have been produced from the underlying properties and sold (which amount is the equivalent of 10.61 MMBOE in respect of the Trust’s right to receive 90% of the net proceeds from such reserves pursuant to the NPI), or (b) the sale of the net profits interest. After the termination of the Trust, it will pay no further distributions and the market price of Trust units will have declined to zero. The remaining reserve quantities are projected to be produced prior to December 31, 2021, based on the Trust’s reserve report as of December 31, 2018. As a result, the Trust is not currently expected to contractually terminate until December 31, 2021, and additional reserves and production attributable to the NPI may be available for distribution to unitholders between the time that the Trust’s minimum 10.61 MMBOE have been produced and sold and the Trust’s expected termination. However, there is no assurance that this will occur.
 The Trust will dissolve prior to the termination of the NPI if:

· | the Trust sells the NPI;
--+-------------------------


· | annual cash proceeds to the Trust attributable to the NPI are less than $2.0 million for each of any two consecutive years;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the holders of a majority of the outstanding Trust units vote in favor of dissolution; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Trust is judicially dissolved.
--+-----------------------------------

  The Trustee would then sell all of the Trust’s assets, either by private sale or public auction, and distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Trust unitholders.
 Computation of Net Proceeds
 The provisions of the conveyance governing the computation of net proceeds are detailed and extensive. The following information summarizes the material information contained in the conveyance related to the computation of net proceeds. For more detailed provisions concerning the NPI, we make reference to the conveyance agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. Net Profits Interest
 The NPI was conveyed to the Trust by Whiting Oil and Gas on March 28, 2012 by means of a conveyance instrument that has been recorded in the appropriate real property records in each county where the underlying properties are located. The NPI burdens the interests owned by Whiting in the underlying properties.
 The conveyance creating the NPI provides that the Trust is entitled to receive an amount of cash for each quarter equal to 90% of the net proceeds (calculated as described below) from the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid production attributable to the underlying properties.
 The amounts paid to the Trust for the NPI are based on the definitions of “gross proceeds” and “net proceeds” contained in the conveyance and described below. Under the conveyance, net proceeds are computed quarterly, and 90% of the aggregate net proceeds, if any, attributable to a computation period are paid to the Trust no later than 60 days following the end of the computation period (or the next succeeding business day). Whiting does not pay to the Trust any interest on the net proceeds held by Whiting prior to payment to the Trust. The Trustee makes distributions to Trust unitholders quarterly when the NPI generates distributable income.
 “Gross proceeds” means the aggregate amount received by Whiting from sales of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids produced from the underlying properties (other than amounts received for certain future non‑consent operations). Gross proceeds does not include any amount for oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids lost in production or marketing or used by Whiting in drilling, production and plant operations. Gross proceeds includes “take‑or‑pay” or “ratable take” payments for future production in the event that they are not subject to repayment due to insufficient subsequent production or purchases.
 “Net proceeds” means gross proceeds less Whiting’s share of the following:

· | any taxes paid by the owner of an underlying property to the extent not deducted in calculating gross proceeds, including estimated and accrued general property (ad valorem), production, severance, sales, excise and other taxes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the aggregate amounts paid by Whiting upon settlement of the hedge contracts on a quarterly basis, as specified in the hedge contracts, which all terminated as of December 31, 2014;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  10

 


· | any extraordinary taxes or windfall profits taxes that may be assessed in the future that are based on profits realized or prices received for production from the underlying properties;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | all other costs and expenses, development costs and liabilities of testing, drilling, completing, recompleting, workovers, equipping, plugging back, operating and producing oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, including allocated expenses such as labor, vehicle and travel costs and materials other than costs and expenses for certain future non‑consent operations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | costs or charges associated with gathering, treating and processing oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (provided, however that any proceeds attributable to treatment or processing will offset such costs or charges, if any);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | costs paid pursuant to existing operating agreements, including producing overhead charges;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | to the extent Whiting is the operator of an underlying property and there is no operating agreement covering such underlying property, the overhead charges allocated by Whiting to such underlying property calculated in the same manner Whiting allocates overhead to other similarly owned property;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | amounts previously included in gross proceeds but subsequently paid as a refund, interest or penalty; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | amounts reserved at the option of Whiting for development expenditure projects, including well drilling, recompletion and workover costs, maintenance or operating expenses, which amounts will at no time exceed $2.0 million in the aggregate, and will be subject to the limitations described below (provided that such costs shall not be debited from gross proceeds when actually incurred).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  All of the hedge payments received by Whiting from the counterparty upon settlements of hedge contracts and certain other non‑production revenues, as detailed in the conveyance, offset the production and development costs outlined above (such production and development costs excluding the last bullet point above) in calculating the net proceeds. Plugging and abandonment liabilities relating to the underlying properties will not be deducted from the gross proceeds in determining net proceeds. If certain other non‑production revenues exceed the operating expenses during a quarterly period, the use of such excess amounts to offset operating expenses may be deferred, with interest accruing on such amounts at the prevailing money market rate, until the next quarterly period when such amounts, together with other offsets to costs for the applicable quarter, are less than such expenses. If any excess amounts have not been used to offset costs at the time when the NPI terminates or is sold, then unitholders will not be entitled to receive the benefit of such excess amounts.
 The capital expenditures included in the net proceeds attributable to the underlying properties are subject to an annual limitation that became effective January 1, 2018. As a result, the sum of the capital expenditures and amounts reserved for approved capital expenditure projects for each year beginning in 2018 may not exceed the average annual capital expenditure amount. The “average annual capital expenditure amount” means the quotient of (x) the sum of the capital expenditures and amounts reserved for approved capital expenditure projects with respect to the three years ended December 31, 2017, divided by (y) three, which amount equals $3.9 million and will be increased annually by 2.5% to account for expected increased costs due to inflation beginning December 31, 2017. The capital expenditures incurred during 2018 did not exceed this annual limitation, and capital expenditures included in the net proceeds attributable to the underlying properties cannot exceed $4.1 million during the year ending December 31, 2019.
 Pursuant to the terms of its applicable joint operating agreements, Whiting deducts from gross proceeds an overhead fee to operate those underlying properties for which Whiting has been designated as the operator. Additionally, with respect to those underlying properties for which Whiting is the operator but where there is no operating agreement in place, Whiting deducts from the gross proceeds an overhead fee calculated in the same manner that Whiting allocates overhead to other similarly owned properties, as is customary in the oil and gas industry. Operating overhead activities include various engineering, legal and administrative functions. The Trust’s portion of the monthly charge averaged $346 per month per active operated well, which totaled $1.3 million for the four distributions made during the year ended December 31, 2018. The fee is adjusted annually pursuant to COPAS guidelines and will increase or decrease each year based on changes in the year‑end index of average weekly earnings of crude petroleum and natural gas workers.
 In the event that the net proceeds for any computation period is a negative amount, the Trust will receive no payment for that period, and any such negative amount plus accrued interest at the prevailing money market rate will be deducted from gross proceeds in the following computation period for purposes of determining the net proceeds for that following computation period.
 Gross proceeds and net proceeds are calculated on a cash basis, except that certain costs, primarily ad valorem taxes and expenditures of a material amount, may be determined on an accrual basis.
 Commodity Hedge Contracts
 Whiting entered into certain costless collar hedge contracts to reduce the exposure to volatility in the underlying properties’ oil revenues due to fluctuations in crude oil prices, and to achieve more predictable cash flows. Whiting in turn conveyed the rights and obligations 

 
  11

 
of such costless collar hedge contracts to the Trust. All costless collar hedge contracts terminated as of December 31, 2014. Accordingly, there were no hedge contracts in place during any period presented in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. No additional hedges are allowed to be placed on Trust assets, and the Trust cannot therefore enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Consequently, there are no future cash settlement gains or losses on commodity derivatives, and the Trust therefore has increased exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility.
 Additional Provisions
 If a controversy arises as to the sales price of any production, then for purposes of determining gross proceeds:

· | amounts withheld or placed in escrow by a purchaser are not considered to be received by Whiting until actually collected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | amounts received by Whiting and promptly deposited with a nonaffiliated escrow agent will not be considered to have been received until disbursed to Whiting by the escrow agent; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | amounts received by Whiting and not deposited with an escrow agent will be considered to have been received.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Trustee is not obligated to return any cash received from the NPI. Any overpayments made to the Trust by Whiting due to adjustments to prior calculations of net proceeds or otherwise will reduce future amounts payable to the Trust until Whiting recovers the overpayments plus interest at the prevailing money market rate. Whiting may make such adjustments to prior calculations of net proceeds without the consent of the Trust unitholders or the Trustee, but is required to provide the Trustee with notice of such adjustments and supporting data.
 In addition, Whiting may, without the consent of the Trust unitholders, require the Trust to sell the net profits interest associated with any well or lease that accounts for less than or equal to 0.25% of the total production from the underlying properties in the prior 12 months, provided that the net profits interest covered by such releases cannot exceed, during any 12‑month period, an aggregate fair market value to the Trust of $1.0 million. These releases will be made only in connection with a sale by Whiting of the relevant underlying properties and are conditioned upon the Trust receiving an amount equal to the fair value to the Trust of such portion of the NPI. Any net sales proceeds paid to the Trust are distributable to Trust unitholders in the quarter in which they are received. In 2016 and 2015, Whiting completed divestitures of certain producing and shut‑in wells for sales proceeds attributable to the Trust’s interest of $58,500 and $0.3 million, respectively, which properties had proved reserves of 16.32 MBOE with respect to the Trust’s 90% net profits interest. For further information on these divestitures refer to “Abandonment, Sale and Farm‑out of Underlying Properties” in Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
 For the underlying properties for which Whiting is the designated operator, it may enter into farm‑out, operating, participation and other similar agreements with respect to the property. Whiting may enter into any of these agreements without the consent or approval of the Trustee or any Trust unitholder. Whiting entered into three farm‑out agreements with a third‑party partner for certain underlying properties within the (i) Keystone South field located in Winkler County, Texas in April 2016, (ii) Signal Peak field located in Howard County, Texas in February 2017 and (iii) Flying W, SE field located in Winkler County, Texas in March 2017. Refer to “Abandonment, Sale and Farm‑out of Underlying Properties” in Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information related to these farm‑out agreements.
 Whiting or any other operator has the right to abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes the well or property ceases to produce or is not capable of producing in commercially paying quantities. In making such decisions, Whiting is required under the applicable conveyance to operate, or to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the operators of the underlying properties to operate, the underlying properties as a reasonably prudent operator in the same manner it would if these properties were not burdened by the NPI. Upon termination of the lease, the portion of the NPI relating to the abandoned property will be extinguished.
 Whiting must maintain books and records sufficient to determine the amounts payable under the NPI to the Trust. Quarterly and annually, Whiting must deliver to the Trustee a statement of the computation of net proceeds for each computation period. The Trustee has the right to inspect and copy the books and records maintained by Whiting during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice.
 Federal Income Tax Matters
 The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax matters that may be relevant to the Trust unitholders. This summary is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is referred to as the “Code,” existing (and to the extent proposed) Treasury regulations thereunder, and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to 

 
  12

 
change or different interpretation at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. No attempt has been made in the following summary to comment on all U.S. federal income tax matters affecting the Trust or the Trust unitholders.
 The summary is limited to Trust unitholders who are individual citizens or residents of the United States. Accordingly, the following summary has limited application to domestic corporations and persons subject to specialized federal income tax treatment such as, without limitation, tax‑exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, insurance companies, and foreign persons or entities. Each Trust unitholder should consult his own tax advisor with respect to his particular circumstances.
 Classification and Taxation of the Trust
 Tax counsel to the Trust advised the Trust at the time of formation that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in its opinion, the Trust would be treated as a grantor trust and not as an unincorporated business entity. No ruling has been or will be requested from the IRS or another taxing authority. The remainder of the discussion below is based on tax counsel’s opinion, at the time of formation, that the Trust will be classified as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a grantor trust, the Trust is not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the Trust level. Rather, each Trust unitholder is considered for federal income tax purposes to own and receive its proportionate share of the Trust’s assets directly as though no Trust were in existence. The income of the Trust is deemed to be received or accrued by the Trust unitholder at the time such income is received or accrued by the Trust, rather than when distributed by the Trust. Each Trust unitholder is subject to tax on its proportionate share of the income and gain attributable to the assets of the Trust and is entitled to claim its proportionate share of the deductions and expenses attributable to the assets of the Trust, subject to applicable limitations, in accordance with the Trust unitholder’s tax method of accounting and taxable year without regard to the taxable year or accounting method employed by the Trust.
 On the basis of that advice, the Trust will file annual information returns, reporting to the Trust unitholders all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit. The Trust will allocate items of income, gain, loss, deductions and credits to Trust unitholders based on record ownership at each quarterly record date. It is possible that the IRS or another tax authority could disagree with this allocation method and could assert that income and deductions of the Trust should be determined and allocated on a daily, prorated or other basis, which could require adjustments to the tax returns of the Trust unitholders affected by the issue and result in an increase in the administrative expense of the Trust in subsequent periods.
 Classification of the Net Profits Interest
 Tax counsel to the Trust also advised the Trust at the time of formation that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, based upon representations made by Whiting regarding the expected economic life of the underlying properties and the expected duration of the NPI, in its opinion the NPI should be treated as a “production payment” under Section 636 of the Code, or otherwise as a debt instrument. On the basis of that advice, the Trust treats the NPI as indebtedness subject to Treasury regulations applicable to contingent payment debt instruments, and by purchasing Trust units, a Trust unitholder agrees to be bound by the Trust’s application of those regulations, including the Trust’s determination of the rate at which interest will be deemed to accrue on the NPI. No assurance can be given that the IRS or another tax authority will not assert that the NPI should be treated differently. Any such different treatment could affect the timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in Trust units and could require a Trust unitholder to accrue income at a rate different than that determined by the Trust. Reporting Requirements for Widely‑Held Fixed Investment Trusts
 Some Trust units are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in the Treasury regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners and brokers holding an interest for a custodian street name, collectively referred to herein as “middlemen”). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a non‑mortgage widely held fixed investment trust (“WHFIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 601 Travis Street, 16th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002, telephone number 512‑236‑6599, is the representative of the Trust that will provide the tax information in accordance with applicable Treasury regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the middlemen holding Trust units on behalf of unitholders, and not the Trustee of the Trust, are solely responsible for complying with the information reporting requirements under the Treasury regulations with respect to such Trust units, including the issuance of IRS Forms 1099 and certain written tax statements. Unitholders whose Trust units are held by middlemen should consult with such middlemen regarding the information that will be reported to them by the middlemen with respect to the Trust units. Any generic tax information provided by the Trustee of the Trust is intended to be used only to assist Trust unitholders in the preparation of their federal and state income tax returns.

 Available Trust Tax Information
 In compliance with the Treasury regulations reporting requirements for non‑mortgage widely‑held fixed investment trusts and the dissemination of Trust tax reporting information, the Trustee provides a generic tax information reporting booklet which is intended to be used only to assist Trust unitholders in the preparation of their 2018 federal and state income tax returns. The projected payment schedule for the NPI is included with the tax information booklet. This tax information booklet can be obtained at http://whitingwhz.investorhq.businesswire.com.
 On December 22, 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”). The new legislation significantly changes the U.S. corporate tax law by, among other things, lowering the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations from 35% to 21% beginning in January 2018 which rate applies to both ordinary income and capital gains. Additionally, the TCJA lowers the highest marginal U.S federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income of individuals from 39% to 37%. The highest marginal U.S federal income tax rate applicable to long‑term capital gains (generally, gains from the sale or exchange of certain investment assets held for more than one year) and also applicable to qualified dividends of individuals is 20%.
 Section 1411 of the Code imposes a 3.8% Medicare tax on certain investment income earned by individuals, estates, and trusts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012. For these purposes, investment income generally will include a Trust unitholder’s allocable share of the Trust’s interest income plus the gain recognized from a sale of Trust units. In the case of an individual, the tax is imposed on the lesser of (i) the individual’s net investment income from all investments, or (ii) the amount by which the individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds specified threshold levels depending on such individual’s federal income tax filing status. In the case of an estate or trust, the tax is imposed on the lesser of (x) undistributed net investment income, or (y) the excess adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket applicable to an estate or trust begins.
 Environmental Matters and Regulation
 The operations of the underlying properties are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the release, discharge or emission of materials into the environment; the handling of hazardous materials; or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things:
· | require the acquisition of a permit for drilling and other regulated activities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require the proper management and disposal of waste and restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limit or prohibit drilling activities in sensitive areas, such as wilderness areas, wetlands, streams or areas that may contain endangered or threatened species and their habitats;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require investigatory or remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits, plug and abandon wells and restore properties upon which wells are drilled;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | apply specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | enjoin some or all of the operations of the underlying properties deemed in non‑compliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of significant administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements on such operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, these laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly well construction, drilling, water management or completion activities or waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on the operating costs of the properties comprising the underlying properties.
 President Trump has indicated that he would work to ease regulatory burdens on industry and on the oil and gas sector, including environmental regulations. However, any executive orders the President may issue or any new legislation Congress may pass with the goal of reducing environmental statutory or regulatory requirements may be challenged in court. In addition, various state laws and regulations (and permits issued thereunder) will be unaffected by federal changes unless and until the state laws and corresponding permits are similarly changed, and any judicial review is completed.

 The following is a summary of the more significant existing laws, rules and regulations to which the operations of the underlying properties are subject that are material to the operation of the underlying properties.
 Waste Handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non‑hazardous wastes. Under delegations of authority from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. In its operations at the underlying properties, Whiting generates solid and hazardous wastes that are subject to RCRA and comparable state laws. Drilling fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non‑hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non‑hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In September 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a petition with the EPA, requesting it to reconsider the RCRA exemption for exploration, production and development wastes. In May 2016, several environmental groups sued the EPA for failing to update its rules for management of oil and gas drilling waste under RCRA. The petitioners requested that the EPA revise its regulations for waste materials generated as a result of oil and gas exploration and production activities. The petitioners claimed that the EPA has not reviewed or revised its regulations for management of wastes from oil and gas exploration and production operations since 1988, even though the statute requires the EPA to review and, if necessary, revise the regulations every three years. In December 2016, the court entered a Consent Decree resolving the litigation. Under the Consent Decree, the EPA has agreed to propose no later than March 15, 2019 a rulemaking for revision of the regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. On February 22, 2019, the EPA filed a Notice of Automatic Extension of Deadline under Paragraph 24 of the Consent Decree with the Court. That Notice stated that, in light of the 35 day government shutdown, the EPA was invoking the automatic extension provisions of the Decree and will take the required actions no later than April 23, 2019. In the event that the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Any such change in the current RCRA exemption and comparable state laws, could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the cash distributions to the Trust unitholders.
 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law and comparable state laws impose strict joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. While Whiting generates materials in the course of its operations of the underlying properties that may be regulated as hazardous substances, Whiting has not been notified that it has been named as a potentially responsible party at or with respect to any Superfund sites. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, waste products or other chemicals into the environment.
 The underlying properties of the Trust may have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although Whiting believes that it has utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties, or on or under other locations, including off‑site locations, where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, the underlying properties of the Trust may have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons and materials was not under Whiting’s control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may give rise to potential liabilities for Whiting pursuant to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, Whiting could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination or to pay some or all of the costs of any such action.
 Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, as amended (the “CWA”), and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into state waters or other waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) or an analogous state or tribal agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water 

 
  15

 
runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non‑compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
 Hydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight rock formations. The process involves the injection of mainly water and sand plus a de minimis amount of chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing has been utilized to complete wells drilled on the underlying properties, and Whiting expects it will also be used in the future. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, however the EPA also issued guidance in 2014 for permitting authorities and the industry regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel.
 In December 2016, the EPA released a final report on the potential impacts of oil and gas fracturing activities on the quality and quantity of drinking water resources in the United States. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA issued a final rule promulgating pretreatment standards for the oil and gas extraction category which would address discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly‑owned treatment works. Unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities can send wastewater to a private wastewater treatment facility that can either discharge treated water or send it to a publicly‑owned treatment works. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information regarding the extent to which these facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of the facilities, the environmental impacts of discharges and other information.
 In addition to the EPA, other federal agencies are also examining hydraulic fracturing, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the U.S. Department of Interior and the White House Council for Environmental Quality. In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress from time to time to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could ban, restrict or impose additional requirements on activities relating to hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. For example, in June 2011, Texas enacted a law that requires the disclosure of information regarding the substances used in the hydraulic fracturing process to the Railroad Commission of Texas (the entity that regulates oil and natural gas production in Texas) and the public. Such federal or state legislation could require the disclosure of chemical constituents used in the fracturing process to state or federal regulatory authorities who could then make such information publicly available. Disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing hydraulic fracturing to pursue legal proceedings against producers and service providers based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect human health or the environment, including groundwater.
 In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays, litigation risk and potential increases in costs. Further, local governments may seek to adopt, and some have adopted, ordinances within their jurisdictions restricting the use of or regulating the time, place and manner of drilling or hydraulic fracturing. No assurance can be given as to whether or not similar measures might be considered or implemented in the jurisdictions in which the underlying properties are located. If new laws, regulations or ordinances that significantly restrict or otherwise impact hydraulic fracturing are passed by Congress or adopted in the states or local municipalities where the underlying properties are located, such legal requirements could prohibit or make it more difficult or costly for Whiting to perform hydraulic fracturing activities on the underlying properties and thereby could affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable. In addition, restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that Whiting is ultimately able to produce in commercially paying quantities from the underlying properties and could reduce cash distributions by the Trust and the value of Trust units.
 In addition, in July 2014, a major university and U.S. Geological Survey researchers published a study purporting to find a connection between the deep well injection of hydraulic fracturing wastewater and a sharp increase in seismic activity in Oklahoma since 2008. This study, as well as subsequent studies and reports, may trigger new legislation or regulations that would limit or ban the disposal of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in deep injection wells. If such new laws or rules are adopted, operations on the underlying properties may be curtailed while alternative treatment and disposal methods are developed and approved, or the costs of operations on the underlying properties may increase, which could reduce cash distributions by the Trust and the value of Trust units.
 Global Warming and Climate Change. In December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climate changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air 

 
  16

 
Act, as amended (the “CAA”), including rules that limit emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles beginning with the 2012 model year. The EPA has asserted that these final motor vehicle GHGs emission standards trigger the CAA construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources, commencing when the motor vehicle standards took effect in January 2011. In June 2010, the EPA also published its final rule to address the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (the “PSD”) and Title V permitting programs. This rule “tailors” these permitting programs to apply to certain stationary sources of GHG emissions in a multi‑step process, with the largest sources first becoming subject to permitting. Further, facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions are required to reduce those emissions consistent with guidance for determining “best available control technology” standards for GHG, which guidance was published by the EPA in November 2010. Also in November 2010, the EPA expanded its existing GHG reporting rule to include onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. This rule requires reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities on an annual basis. Whiting believes that it is in compliance with all substantial applicable emissions requirements.
 In June 2014, the Supreme Court upheld most of the EPA’s GHGs permitting requirements, allowing the agency to regulate the emission of GHGs from stationary sources already subject to the PSD and Title V requirements. Certain of Whiting’s equipment and installations may currently be subject to PSD and Title V requirements and hence, under the Supreme Court’s ruling, may also be subject to the installation of controls to capture GHGs. For any equipment or installation so subject, Whiting may have to incur increased compliance costs to capture related GHGs emissions, which could reduce cash distributions by the Trust and the value of Trust units.
 In October 2016, the EPA proposed revisions to the rule applicable to GHGs for PSD and Title V permitting requirements. On November 18, 2016, the EPA extended the public comment period for the rulemaking to December 16, 2016. The proposed rule, which would not expand federal GHG air permitting requirements, has not yet been finalized.
 In accordance with President Obama’s Climate Action Plan, in August 2015, the EPA issued a rule to reduce carbon emissions from electric generating units. The rule, commonly called the “Clean Power Plan,” requires states to develop plans to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel‑fired generating units commencing in 2022, with the reductions to be fully phased in by 2030. Each state is given a different carbon reduction target, but the EPA expects that, in the aggregate, the overall proposal will reduce carbon emissions from electric generating units by 32% from 2005 levels. States are given substantial flexibility in meeting their emission reduction targets and can generally choose to lower carbon emissions by replacing higher carbon generation, such as coal or natural gas, with lower carbon generation, such as efficient natural gas units or renewable energy alternatives. Several industry groups and states have challenged the Clean Power Plan in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and in February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan while it is being challenged in court. On March 28, 2017, the Trump Administration issued an executive order directing the EPA to review the Clean Power Plan. On October 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule that would repeal the Clean Power Plan. On August 18, 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule as a replacement to the Clean Power Plan. The ACE rule was published in the Federal Register on August 31, 2018, and comments were accepted until October 31, 2018. The EPA has not yet issued a final ACE rule, although several states have announced their intention to challenge the rule once it is made final.
 In addition, both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the development of GHG inventories, GHG permitting and/or regional GHG cap‑and‑trade programs. Most of these cap‑and‑trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. In the absence of new legislation, the EPA has issued the Subpart OOOOa regulations that limit emissions of GHGs associated with the operations of the underlying properties, which will require Whiting to incur costs to inventory and reduce emissions of GHGs associated with the operations of the underlying properties and that could adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas produced. Finally, it should be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events.
 Air Emissions. The CAA and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants from various industrial sources through air emissions permitting programs and also impose other monitoring and reporting requirements. Operators of the underlying properties, including Whiting, may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining pre‑construction and operating permits and approvals for air emissions. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. For example, in 2012, the EPA finalized rules establishing new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production operations. Specifically, the EPA’s rule includes New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and 

 
  17

 
processing activities. Among other things, these standards require the application of reduced emission completion techniques associated with the completion of newly drilled and fractured wells in addition to existing wells that are refractured. The rules also establish specific requirements regarding emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. These rules could require a number of modifications to operations at the underlying properties including the installation of new equipment. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may adversely impact cash distributions to unitholders. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non‑compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations.
 The EPA announced in 2015 that it would directly regulate methane emissions from oil and natural gas wells for the first time as part of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan. As part of this strategy, in May 2016, the EPA issued three final rules. The EPA issued a final rule that updated the New Source Performance Standards to add Subpart OOOOa requirements that the oil and gas industry reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to cover additional equipment and activities in the oil and gas production chain. The final rule sets emissions limits for methane, which is the principal greenhouse gas emitted by equipment and processes in the oil and gas sector. This rule applies to new, reconstructed and modified processes and equipment. This rule also expands the volatile organic compound emissions limits to hydraulically fractured oil wells and equipment used across the industry that was not regulated in the 2012 rules. The rule also requires owners and operators to find and repair leaks, also known as “fugitive emissions.” The EPA also issued a final rule known as the Source Determination Rule, which is intended to clarify when multiple pieces of equipment and activities in the oil and gas industry must be deemed a single source when determining whether major source permitting programs apply under the prevention of significant deterioration, nonattainment new source review preconstruction and operation permit programs under Title V of the CAA (“Title V”). The final rule defines the term “adjacent” to clarify that equipment and activities in the oil and gas sector that are under common control will be considered part of the same source if they are located near each other – specifically, if they are located on the same site, or on sites that share equipment and are within one quarter of a mile of each other. This rule applies to equipment and activities used for onshore oil and natural gas production, and for natural gas processing.
 Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may adversely impact cash distributions to unitholders. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non‑compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations.
 OSHA and Other Laws and Regulation. Whiting is subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right‑to‑know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that Whiting organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in its operations. Whiting believes that it is in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable requirements.
 Endangered Species Considerations. The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (“ESA”), restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. If endangered species are located in areas of the underlying properties where Whiting or the other underlying property operators wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, the work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on listing more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA over the next several years. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause operators of those underlying properties, including Whiting, to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on their exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on their ability to develop and produce reserves.

 Consideration of Environmental Issues in Connection with Governmental Approvals. Whiting’s operations frequently require licenses, permits and/or other governmental approvals. Several federal statutes, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”) and the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) require federal agencies to evaluate environmental issues in connection with granting such approvals and/or taking other major agency actions. OCSLA, for instance, requires the U.S. Department of Interior to evaluate whether certain proposed activities would cause serious harm or damage to the marine, coastal or human environment. Similarly, NEPA requires the Department of Interior and other federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency would have to prepare an environmental assessment and, potentially, an environmental impact statement. Recent federal court cases involving natural gas pipelines have involved challenges to the sufficiency of the evaluation of climate change impacts in environmental impact statements prepared under NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
 Whiting believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to the current operations of the underlying properties and that its continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the cash distributions to the Trust unitholders. For instance, Whiting did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 with respect to these properties. Additionally, Whiting has informed the Trust that Whiting is not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during 2019 with respect to these properties. However, there is no assurance that the passage of more stringent laws or implementing regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on the operations of these properties and the cash distributions to the Trust unitholders.
