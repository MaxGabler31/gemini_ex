Overview
 
We are a biotechnology company focused on developing personalized immune therapies for cancer. We have developed a platform technology, DCVax, which uses activated dendritic cells to mobilize a patient's own immune system to attack their cancer.
 
Our lead product, DCVax®-L, is designed to treat solid tumor cancers in which the tumor can be surgically removed. This product in an ongoing Phase III trial for newly diagnosed Glioblastome multiforme (GBM). 331 patients have been enrolled in the trial, and enrollment is closed. The Company is also working on preparations for Phase II trials of DCVax-L for other indications.
 
Our second product, DCVax®-Direct, is designed to treat inoperable solid tumors. A 40-patient Phase I trial has been completed, and included treatment of a diverse range of cancers. The Company is working on preparations for Phase II trials of DCVax-Direct.
 
The DCVax Technology
 
Our platform technology, DCVax, is a personalized immune therapy which consists of a therapeutic vaccine that uses a patient's own dendritic cells, or DCs, the master cells of the immune system, as the therapeutic agent. The patient’s DCs are obtained through a blood draw, or leukapheresis. The DCs are then activated and loaded with biomarkers (“antigens”) from the patient’s own tumor. For DCVax-L, the antigen loading process takes place during the manufacturing of the product. For DCVax-Direct, the antigen loading process takes place in situ after the product is directly injected into the patient’s inoperable tumors. The loading of antigens into the DCs “educates” the DCs about what the immune system needs to target. 
Clinical Trials and Early Access Programs
 
DCVax-L for Operable Solid Tumors: GBM Brain Cancer
 
Our lead product candidate is DCVax-L for Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM): the most aggressive and lethal type of brain cancer. With standard of care treatment for GBM today, including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the median time to tumor recurrence is about 7 months, and the median survival is about 15-17 months. There is an urgent need for new and better treatments.
 
DCVax-L is currently in a 331-patient Phase III trial. Enrollment has closed. Patients in the trial are continuing to be treated, and “events” of tumor recurrence and patient deaths are accumulating and being tracked. The trial includes a crossover option, under which patients who were originally assigned to the placebo arm of the trial have an opportunity, when their tumor recurs, to cross over and start receiving DCVax-L. Patients who were originally assigned to the treatment arm may also continue receiving the DCVax-L treatment after their tumor recurs. The patients, the physicians and the Company remain blinded as to which arm of the trial patients were in prior to crossover.
 
The trial was on partial clinical hold for a period of time in regard to screening of new patients for enrollment; however, the patients already in the trial continued to be treated in accordance with the trial protocol, without interruption. In December 2016, the Company announced that to date the regulators had not agreed to remove the partial hold, and the Company had determined that it would not enroll the last 17 of the planned 348 patients. Thereafter, in February 2017, the FDA lifted its partial hold. The Company had self-imposed a hold on screening in countries outside the US, this remains in place in agreement with the regulators, and the Company will not enroll the last 17 patients as announced in December 2016.

The Company plans to conduct Phase II trials of DCVax-L in combination with other agents, such as checkpoint inhibitors, as resources permit. Such combination trials may include DCVax-L and Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for colorectal cancer, as the Company has previously reported. Certain preparatory work will be required and regulatory approvals will have to be obtained for these trials, in addition to financing.
 
“Information Arm” Outside the Phase III Trial
 
In parallel with the Phase III trial of DCVax-L for GBM, we accepted a total of 55 patients into an “Information Arm” outside of the trial, who failed to meet the eligibility requirements for the trial. Most of these patients were actual or potential “rapid progressors” (patients in whom the brain cancer is already appearing to re-grow by the time the patient finishes the 6 weeks of daily radiotherapy and daily chemotherapy following surgical removal of the tumor). These patients were generally treated with the same DCVax-L product as in the Phase III trial, on the same treatment schedule, at the same medical centers, in the same time period, and the data were collected and maintained by the same Contract Research Organization (CRO) as is managing the trial. Among these patients, about 20 of them apparently met the “progression” (tumor re-growth) criteria at two-time points, both at the end of the 6 weeks of daily radiation and chemotherapy and 8 weeks later, and about 25 of the patients apparently met the “progression” criteria at one of the two-time points.
DCVax-L Early Access Programs
 
In March 2014, we received approval from the German regulatory authority of a “Hospital Exemption” for DCVax-L for glioma brain cancers under Section 4b of the German Drug Law outside of our Phase III trial. We undertook treatment of 9 patients under the Hospital Exemption. We did not undertake new Hospital Exemption patients while the Phase III trial enrollment was on partial hold. We do not plan to undertake further Hospital Exemption patients, as we are focused on completing the accumulation of data events, and analysis and reporting of the data, for the Phase III trial.
 
As previously reported, we have also treated a substantial number of compassionate use patients, under an Expanded Access Protocol in the US. We have also been considering other early access programs.  
 
DCVax-Direct for Inoperable Solid Tumor Cancers
 
Our DCVax-Direct product offers a potential new treatment option for inoperable tumors. This can potentially apply to a wide range of clinical situations: for example, situations in which patients' tumors are considered inoperable because the patient has multiple tumors, or their tumor cannot be completely removed, or the surgery would cause undue damage to the patient and impair their quality of life.
 
A large number of patients with a variety of cancer types are faced with this situation, because their tumors are already locally advanced or have begun to metastasize by the time symptoms develop and the patients seek diagnosis and treatment. For these patients, the outlook today is bleak and survival remains quite limited.
 
DCVax-Direct is administered by direct injection into a patient's tumors. It can potentially be injected into any number of tumors, enabling patients with locally advanced disease or with metastases to be treated. With image guidance, DCVax-Direct can also be injected into tumors in virtually any location in the body.
 
We conducted a 40-patient Phase I trial of DCVax-Direct at MD Anderson Cancer Center and at Orlando Health, mainly during 2013-2015, and we are still following patients from this trial. The patients enrolled in this trial had failed other treatments, and had multiple tumors and actively progressing disease. In spite of this heavy disease burden, the treatment regimen in this first clinical trial was very conservative: only one tumor was injected in each patient, and most of the patients received only 3 treatments over the course of 2 weeks, with some receiving a 4 th treatment at week 8 and beyond.
 
Despite these challenging circumstances, clinical effects seen in various patients include examples of tumor necrosis (i.e., cell death) in the injected tumors, shrinkage or stabilization in some non-injected tumors, stabilization of disease and survival times beyond what was expected. We are continuing to collect follow-up data, and anticipate continuing to report on it.
 
This Phase I trial was designed to be very informative: we treated numerous diverse types of cancers (sarcoma, pancreatic, colorectal, lung, melanoma and others); we tested three different dose levels and various methods of image-guided administration; we collected both imaging and biopsy data, and correlated them with clinical effects in patients; we evaluated both local effects in the injected tumors and systemic effects in the non-injected tumors; we evaluated potential endpoints for future trials; and most importantly, we evaluated safety.
 
In the Phase I stage of the DCVax-Direct Phase I/II trial, the safety profile was excellent (as has also been the case over the years with DCVax-L). Typically, patients develop a fever after the injections, to a limited extent and for a limited duration, and they do not generally experience any significant toxicities.
 
Based upon the data and experience to date, we are planning to proceed with at least two Phase II trials of DCVax-Direct in different cancers, if resources permit. In the Phase II trials, we plan to inject multiple tumors, rather than just one tumor, and we plan to administer more doses than in the Phase I trial.

Target Markets for DCVax Products
 
Since our DCVax-L product is potentially applicable to all types of operable solid tumors, and our DCVax-Direct product is potentially applicable to all types of inoperable solid tumors, we believe that the potential markets for DCVax products are particularly large. According to the American Cancer Society, 1 in 2 men, and 1 in 3 women, in the U.S. will develop some form of cancer in their lifetime. There are nearly 1.5 million new cases of cancer per year in the U.S., and nearly 600,000 deaths from cancer. The incidence is similar in Europe, the UK and elsewhere.
 
Brain cancer
 
Brain cancers fall into two broad categories: primary (meaning the cancer first originates in the brain) and metastatic (meaning the cancer first appears elsewhere in the body, but subsequently metastasizes or spreads to the brain). In the U.S. alone, on an annual basis, there are some 40,000 new cases of primary brain cancer (including about 12,000 cases of GBM, the most severe grade of primary brain cancer), and 160,000 new cases of metastatic brain cancer. The incidence is similar in Europe, the UK and elsewhere.
 
In addition, brain cancer is a serious medical problem in children 18 years and under. It is the second most frequent type of childhood cancers (after leukemias) and, following progress in reducing death rates from leukemias, it is now a leading cause of childhood cancer deaths.
 
Very little has changed in the last 30 years in the treatment and clinical outcomes for GBM. With typical standard of care treatment today - surgery, radiation and chemotherapy - patients still generally die within a median of about 15-17 months from diagnosis. Loco-regional therapy with alternating electric fields has recently shown an increase in median Progression Free Survival (i.e., time to tumor recurrence) to 6.7 months, and median Overall Survival to 20.9 months, respectively from randomization in clinical trials. However, there has been no material advance in survival with systemic therapies since the addition of temozolomide more than 12 years ago, despite investigations with many diverse agents. There is an urgent need for new treatment options.
 
Manufacturing of DCVax
 
We use a batch manufacturing technology for our DCVax products, and we believe this manufacturing approach is a key part of the practicality of our product and its economic feasibility. Generally, we are able to produce enough doses for the patient’s treatment regimen through just one manufacturing process. When a batch of DCVax product has been made, we then cryopreserve it.
 
Both of these technologies, the personalized batch manufacturing for each patient and the cryopreservation, are essential elements of our manufacturing model and product economics. Together, they enable us to usually incur the high costs of manufacturing just one time for each patient, and then store the multi-year or multi-dose quantity of product, frozen, in single doses. This makes DCVax effectively an “off the shelf” product for the patient after the initial manufacturing, even though it is personalized, and we anticipate that this will enable the pricing of DCVax to be in line with other new cancer drugs. We also believe that both economies of scale and automation will further enhance the product economics. The manufacturing process today is also rapid: about 8 days for DCVax-L, and 7 days for DCVax-Direct, followed by quality control and release testing.
 
We contract out the manufacturing of our DCVax products to Cognate BioServices for the U.S. and Canada, and to Advent BioServices (formerly Cognate U.K.) for Europe. Although there are many contract manufacturers for small molecule drugs and for biologics, there are very few companies who specialize in manufacturing living cell products. Manufacturing of cellular products is fundamentally different than production of small molecules or biologics, and the regulatory requirements are very difficult to meet. Cognate BioServices has long specialized in the production of cellular products, and has a leading track record with such products, and Advent BioServices was formerly part of Cognate.
 
Our DCVax programs generally require that the applicable manufacturing capacity be dedicated exclusively to our programs. Most medical products, including other types of cellular products, are made in batches on a pre-scheduled basis. In contrast, our products are fully personalized and can only be made in individual personalized batches, not large-scale batches of standardized products, and our products are made on demand, on an ongoing basis. So, the manufacturing suites generally must be dedicated entirely to NW Bio’s products.
 
Cognate BioServices’ manufacturing facility for clinical-grade cell products is located in Memphis, Tennessee. Cognate BioServices' facility is approximately 80,000 square feet and contains substantial buildout expansion space in addition to the portions currently built out and in use. The current manufacturing facilities are sufficient to produce DCVax for at least several thousand patients per year. The expansion space could allow us to procure significantly increasing capacity when needed for commercial readiness. We are also developing facilities for manufacturing in the U.K. for the European market. It is necessary for us to have manufacturing operations in Europe to meet the logistical requirements for European patients relating to the collection, delivery and processing of the patient’s blood draw containing the immune cells (for which the time window is too limited to reach the US manufacturing facility).

Intellectual Property and Orphan Drug Designation
 
We have an integrated strategy for protection of our technology through both patents and other mechanisms, such as Orphan Drug status. As of December 31, 2017, we have over 150 issued patents and more than 60 pending patent applications worldwide, grouped into 12 patent families. Of these, 148 issued patents and 60 pending patent applications relate to our DCVax products. In the United States and Europe, some of our patents and applications relate to the composition and use of products, while other patents and applications relate to other aspects such as manufacturing and quality control. For example, in the United States, we have four issued and seven pending patent applications that relate to the composition and/or use of our DCVax products. We also have other U.S patents and applications that cover, among other things, quality control for DCVax and an automated system which we believe will help enable the scale-up of production for large numbers of patients on a cost-effective basis. Similarly, in Europe, we have five patents issued by and six pending patent applications with the European Patent Office ("EPO") that cover our DCVax products, and other patents and applications that cover aspects such as manufacturing and quality control, and the automated system. In Japan, we have seven issued patents and three pending patent applications relating to our DCVax products, as well as manufacturing related patents. Patents have been granted and are pending in other foreign jurisdictions which may be potential future markets for our DCVax products.
 
During 2017, six new patents were issued to us as part of our worldwide patent portfolio. The newly issued patents cover a variety of subject matter, including certain processes and methods for manufacturing and for enhancing the potency of dendritic cells related to our DCVax products, as well as encompassing certain dendritic cell compositions for direct injection into patient tumors related to DCVax-Direct. 
 
The expiration dates of the issued U.S. patents involved in our current business range from 2022 to 2028. The expiration dates of the issued European patents involved in our current business range from 2022 to 2028. For some of the earlier dates, we plan to seek extensions of the patent life, and believe we have reasonable grounds for doing so.
 
In addition to our patent portfolio, we have obtained Orphan Drug designation for our lead product, DCVax-L for glioma brain cancers. Such designation brings with it a variety of benefits, including potential market exclusivity for seven years in the U.S. and ten years in Europe if our product is the first of its type to reach the market.
 
This market exclusivity applies regardless of patents, (i.e., even if the company that developed it has no patent coverage on the product). In addition, the time period for such market exclusivity does not begin to run until product sales begin. In contrast, the time period of a patent begins when the patent is filed and runs down during the years while the product is going through development and clinical trials. 
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. A large and growing number of companies are actively involved in the research and development of immune therapies or cell-based therapies for cancer (including Juno, Kite, Bellicum, Argos, Agenus, Asterias, Dandrit, Immunicum, Sotio, Tocagen and many others). In addition, many big pharma companies (including BMS, Merck, Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, Roche and others) are rapidly commercializing checkpoint inhibitor drugs to “take the brakes off” patients’ immune responses to cancer. Other novel technologies for cancer are also under development or have recently been approved, such as the Optune electro-therapy device of NovoCure. Additionally, many companies are actively involved in the research and development of monoclonal antibody-based and bi-specific antibody based cancer therapies. Currently, a substantial number of antibody-based drugs are approved for commercial sale for cancer therapy, and a large number of additional ones are under development. Many other third parties compete with us in developing alternative therapies to treat cancer, including: biopharmaceutical companies; biotechnology companies; pharmaceutical companies; academic institutions; and other research organizations, as well as some medical device companies.
 
We face extensive competition from companies developing new treatments for brain cancer. These include a variety of immune therapies, as mentioned above, as well as a variety of small molecule drugs and biologics. There are also a number of existing drugs used for the treatment of brain cancer that may compete with our product, including, Avastin® (Roche Holding AG), Gliadel® (Eisai Co. Ltd.), and Temodar® (Merck & Co., Inc.), as well as the Optune electro-therapy device (Novocure) and oncolytic viruses. Both checkpoint inhibitor drugs and T cell based therapies are pursuing clinical trials for solid tumors, including brain cancer, as well.
 
Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and sales than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they enter into collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and collaborators, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs, and in obtaining sites for our clinical trials and enrolling patients.
