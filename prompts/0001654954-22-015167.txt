Business and Market Summary

Organizations are increasingly at risk of being compromised as recent trends within cybersecurity statistics reveal huge increases in attacks leaving a trail of hacked and breached data. Cybersecurity issues continue to be a day-to-day struggle, for many businesses where commonalities of attacks within the digital and growing virtual workplace includes many end point opportunities such as local networks, laptop, tablet, and desktop computers, mobile, industrial control systems and more recently the expanding IoT (Internet of Things).

Digital risk protection is both a technical and business issue. It is a technical issue because any type of digital device can be accessed by cyber-criminals. It is also a business issue as many enterprises still have limited experience and lack awareness on the importance of securing personal customer and or private corporate information.

The Industry/Marketplace

The market for digital risk solutions is highly fragmented, intensely competitive, and constantly evolving. In terms of overall cyberthreats, a Juniper Research report on cybercrime from 2019, suggests that the cost of such malicious attacks will rise to US$5 trillion by 2024. To successfully defend against the malicious intent they face, it is necessary for the enterprise to adopt cybersecurity awareness, prevention, and security best practices, as a part of their corporate culture, to reduce and eliminate the inevitable financial risks presented by daily threats, attacks and breaches.

Overall, the cybersecurity marketplace is large. A consensus of current 2020 projections peg this market growing at a CAGR of 8% from USD $173 billion to USD $274 billion in 2026. The earlier stage, Threat Intelligence market segment within, is presently estimated to be worth USD $ 5.1 billion and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 19.7% to USD $12.53 billion by 2026.

Our Products & Services

Products

We have developed a cyber threat intelligence application that integrates with leading security information and event management (SIEM) platforms to enrich threat data to include a detailed ‘who, what, when, where’ of any potential cyber threat. Tego Guardian pulls in raw cyber threat intelligence from highly trusted sources including FBI Infragard, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Abuse.CH, and SpamHAUS. Using a proprietary process the platform compiles, analyzes, and then delivers that data to a security operations team in a format that is timely, informative, relevant, and compatible. Other platforms currently in the marketplace only identify potential threats, they do not provide specific details needed to counteract the threat such as the source and type of threat. Tego Guardian takes the process one step further by providing this additional critical information allowing network managers to proactively address any potential vulnerabilities saving time and money. 

The first version of the Tego Guardian is for integration with the industry leading Splunk SIEM platform and now available for download via the Splunk app store. 

The second version of the Tego Guardian is for integration with Elastic SIEM and is currently under development.

Services

We current only offers one service: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reporting. CTI reporting provides individuals or enterprises with custom cyber threat intelligence on issues such as social media impersonation, compromised email credentials, look-a-like domains, social media trends and possible DarkWeb presence. Management has received many requests to leverage the threat intelligence used by the Tego Guardian (TTIP) in a customized report and responded to this by developing a threat intelligence product aimed at providing real-time data to specific corporations and individuals. CTI reporting helps individuals and organizations understand the threats that have, will, or are currently directly targeting them. Tego’s CTI reporting service is provided in real time based on emerging threats and on customized cadences defined by the client. The cost to the client will depend on the size and complexity of the client’s cyber footprint. Tego has signed one contract with an enterprise client.

Competition

We compete with an array of established and emerging security software and services vendors. As organizations increasingly embrace cloud platforms, IoT and other new networking technologies, they are becoming increasingly exposed to ever evolving cybercrimes. The introduction of new technologies and market entrants will continue to fuel an intense competitive environment as companies seek solutions to cybersecurity breaches.

Our competitors include vulnerability management and external assessment vendors, diversified security software and services vendors, and providers of threat intelligence platforms that compete with some of the features present in our solution such as Anomali, Recorded Future and Threat Quotient.

We compete based on several factors, including product functionality; scope of offerings; performance; brand, reputation, and customer satisfaction; ease of implementation, use and service; price, scalability, reliability, and security.

We believe that we will compete favorably with respect to these factors and are well positioned as an emerging provider of digital risk protection, data analysis, and professional services.

Strategic Partners and Suppliers

Our channel partners will provide us with additional leverage by assisting in closing customer transactions as part of larger security purchases, sourcing new prospects and securing maintenance renewals. Our first product integration is with Splunk Inc., a leader in Gartner’s 2020 Magic Quadrant (MQ) for SIEM platforms. Splunk is recognized worldwide for the highest overall ability to execute. Thousands of organizations use Splunk as their SIEM for security monitoring, advanced threat detection, incident investigation and forensics, incident response, SOC automation and a wide range of security analytics and operations use cases.
Operations

We will continue to develop the Tego Threat Intelligence Platform, including through the introduction of a SOC (Security Operations Center). We expect continued growth in the number of cloud and SaaS operations experts, to further our goal of delivering the best experience for our SaaS and TEGO Threat Intelligence Platform customers. Accordingly, personnel related costs within our SaaS development, threat intelligence platform, sales, and operations teams, will increase in line with our projected revenue model.

Sales and Marketing

Sales

The initial sales strategy will focus on marketing the advantages of Tego Guardian to existing Splunk users. At present Splunk has 22,000+ customers, in 110 countries including 89 of the Fortune 100. Tego has been assembling a dedicated inside sales team who are specifically trained to market Tego Guardian to these macro-organizations using the Splunk SIEM platform. Tego has also launched a channel partner initiative to foster meaningful, profitable relationships with leading cybersecurity consultants and solution providers. These channel partners will offer Tego Guardian as an upsell to their current clients already using the Splunk SIEM platform. 
Marketing

We will focus our marketing efforts on increasing the strength of the ‘TEGO’ brand, communicating product advantages and business benefits, generating leads for our sales teams and channel partners while driving product adoption. We will deliver targeted content to demonstrate our threat intelligence platform and use digital advertising methods to deliver opportunities to our sales teams. We will engage with existing customers to provide education and awareness to promote expanded use of our software. We will work with our own researchers, as well as the broader security community, to share important information about vulnerabilities and threats through the online community, social media, and traditional public relations.

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act

In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ("JOBS Act") was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:

Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies;

Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;

Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;

Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and

Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements.

In general, under the JOBS Act, a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering ("IPO") of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of:

(i) | the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company's IPO; 
(iii) | the company's issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or 
(iv) | the company becoming a "larger accelerated filer" as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 


 The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings.

Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.

Financial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:

(i) | audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years; 
------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited; 
(iii) | executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies.

(A smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter).

However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.

The JOBS Act also exempts the Company's independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") after the date of the JOBS Act's enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.

The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company's accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.

Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.

Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO.

Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.

Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.

The JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period.

Item 1.A Risk Factors

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.
