ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview of Our Business 



We are a manufacturer of new energy high power lithium batteries that are mainly used in light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools, energy storage including but not limited to uninterruptible power supply (UPS) application, and other high-power applications. Our primary product offering consists of new energy high power lithium batteries, but we are also seeking to expand into the production and sale of light electric vehicles. After completing the acquisition of 81.56% of registered equity interests (representing 75.57% of paid-up capital) of Hitrans in November 2021, we entered into the business of developing and manufacturing NCM precursor and cathode materials. Hitrans is a leading developer and manufacturer of ternary precursor and cathode materials in China, whose products have a wide range of applications including electric vehicles, electric tools, high-end digital products and storage, among others.



We acquired most of our operating assets, including customers, employees, patents and technologies from our former subsidiary BAK International (Tianjin) Ltd. (“BAK Tianjin”). We acquired these assets in exchange for a reduction in accounts receivable from our former subsidiaries that were disposed of in June 2014.



As of December 31, 2021, we report financial and operational information in two segments:  (i) producing high-power lithium battery cells, and (ii) manufacture and sale of materials used in high-power lithium battery cells.



The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our operations in 2021. Our Dalian facility’s operations were suspended in November 2021 due to the COVID-19 containment measures adopted by the local government. Hitrans’s production facility in Shangyu, Zhejiang was also temporarily closed from December 9 to 24, 2021 to comply with the local lockdown policy in response to a surge of COVID-19 cases. Notwithstanding, the COVID-19 pandemic has had limited adverse impacts on our operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. We generated revenues of $52.7 million and $37.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We had a net profit of $61.6 million and net loss of $7.8 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $122.5 million and net assets of $140.9 million. We had negative cash flows from operating activities, an accumulated deficit from recurring net losses incurred for the prior years and significant short-term debt obligations maturing in less than one year as of December 31, 2021.

  
In the second half of 2021, we completed the capital intensive construction undertakings in Nanjing to expand the Company’s manufacturing capabilities for lithium batteries. In addition, we have been expanding our business by developing new products, fostering new partnerships and strategic acquisition of companies that complement and augment our business.



Favorable Policies for New Energy Vehicles



Due to the growing environmental pollution problem, the Chinese government has been providing support to the development of new energy facilities and vehicles for several years. It is expected that we will be able to secure more potential orders from the new energy market. We believe that with the booming market demand in high power lithium-iron products, we can continue as a going concern and return to profitability.

In 2015, to promote the development of electric vehicles industry, the Chinese government issued a subsidy policy named Notice of 2016-2020 New Energy Vehicles Promotion with Financial Support, which regulated subsidies for consumers in purchase of electric vehicles from the central government and local governments. The policy sets forth subsidy standards for various types of electric vehicles based upon the endurance mileage, battery pack energy density, energy consumption level and others, which means new energy vehicles providing long driving range and high technical performance will get higher subsidies. From 2017 to 2020, the Chinese government has gradually reduced the subsidy standards for electric vehicles year by year. On April 23, 2020, the Chinese government extended the subsidy for another two years and the subsidy standards would continue to fall by 10%, 20% and 30% in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. On December 31, 2021, the Chinese government announced to reduce new energy electric vehicle subsidies by 30% in 2022 from 2021. These subsidies are set to be scrapped on December 31, 2022.  


On the other hand, for the purposes of establishing a long-term mechanism for the administration of energy conservation and new energy vehicles, and promoting the development of the automobile industry, the Chinese government has implemented several policies to stimulate the increase of new energy vehicles. On December 26, 2017, the Chinese government issued a policy for exemption of purchase tax for electric vehicles for another three years until 2020. In March 2020, the Chinese government extended the purchase tax exemption from 2020 to 2022.



On September 28, 2017, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a new policy named Measures for Parallel Administration of the Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle Credits of Passenger Vehicle Enterprises (“Measures for Parallel Administration”). According to the Measures for Parallel Administration, the Chinese government will calculate and examine the Average Fuel Consumption Credits and New Energy Vehicle Credits of enterprises manufacturing passenger vehicles. If the enterprises get negative credits on the declaration day, their production of high-fuel consumption vehicles will be suspended. The positive credits of average fuel consumption of passenger vehicle makers may be carried forward or transferred among affiliated enterprises. A passenger vehicle manufacturer’s negative credits with respect to new energy vehicles shall subject the manufacturer to compensation obligations and need to be zeroing through purchasing positive credits of new energy vehicles. Accordingly, the automobile makers are required to produce more new energy vehicles or pay money to other enterprises to get positive credits if their credits are negative. The Measures for Parallel Administration became effective on April 1, 2018.

On October 20, 2020, the State Council of PRC issued a new round of “Development Plan for New Energy Vehicles Industry (2021-2035)” (“Plan”), which is a successor to the previously published “Development Plan for Energy Conservation and New Energy Vehicles Industry (2012-2020)”. The Plan admits several key problems facing Chinese new energy vehicle manufacturers and stresses that these manufacturers should be committed to improving their R&D ability, building more infrastructure and promoting the integration of the whole industry. The Plan further outlined the policy and administrative supports that would be given to the industry, and again certified the importance of the development of new energy vehicles for China.



On January 21, 2021, the Ministry of Transport of PRC issued a new policy named “the 14th Five-year Development Plan for Green Transport” (the “14th Five-year Plan”), which accelerates the promotion of new energy and clean energy vehicles in the area of urban bus system, taxis and logistical vehicles. The 14th Five-year Plan clearly stipulates that the percentage of new energy vehicles in buses, taxis and logistical vehicles in designated national ecological experimental zones and air pollution control zones shall be no lower than 80%.



On October 24, 2021, the State Council of PRC issued a new policy named the “Action Plan to Peak Carbon Dioxide Emissions before 2030” (the “Action Plan”), which further emphasizes the significance of promotion of clean energy generation facilities and the charging networks for new energy vehicles. The Action Plan reflects the determination of the Chinese government in reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and provides tremendous supports to the development of the new energy industry.



On November 15, 2021, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a new policy named “the 14th Five-year Plan for Green Industrial Development”, which clearly sets a target to reach significant achievements in the recycling of batteries in energy storage and power battery area by 2025.



We believe these energy efficiency policies in the long term will result in a healthy development of the new energy vehicles market as a whole. In the short term, the extension of subsidies, to some extent, helps ease the pressure on electric vehicle manufacturers and as a result, will be beneficial to the market of EV batteries in China. In the long term, as the subsidy policy officially comes to an end at the end of 2022, the electric vehicle market will be in full competition. We believe that the market for light electric vehicles including electric bicycles, under this circumstance, will have a big potential to grow. We plan to continue to maintain our focus on the existing cylindrical batteries for UPS market, while directing resources to the light electric vehicle market with our new products featuring higher energy density. Meanwhile, we are also researching new products for electric vehicle market to cater to the EV market demand. We will closely monitor market changes and adjust our operations at appropriate time.



Expansion of Manufacturing Capabilities 



In June 2020, our wholly-owned subsidiary, BAK Asia entered into a framework investment agreement with Jiangsu Gaochun Economic Development Zone Development Group Company (“Gaochun EDZ”), pursuant to which we intend to develop certain lithium battery projects which are expected to have a total production capacity of 8 GWh per year. As of December 31, 2021, we had received government subsidies in an amount of RMB47.1 million (approximately $7.4 million) from Gaochun EDZ. We plan to attain a total capacity of 8 GWh per year to produce lithium batteries for the light electric vehicle (LEV), electric vehicle, and energy storage industries. The Company expects to achieve such capacity expansion through two phases of construction: Phase I is to be completed by the end of 2022 to reach an annual production capacity of 2 GWh. Phase II is to be completed by the end of 2023 to reach the remaining 6 GWh of the planned annual production capacity expansion. The actual production capacity and construction timelines of such battery projects are subject to revision and adjustment based on the market acceptance of our new battery products. We are currently in the first phase construction of facilities, which occupy an area of approximately 10,260 square meters and the second-phase construction is at the design stage. As part of the first phase, we are constructing the production lines of model 32140 battery, a new battery model as further described below. As of December 31, 2021, a total capacity of 0.7 GWh per year was put into operation in Phase I.



Further, we have been constructing a new production line with an annual capacity of 0.4 GWh to produce additional 100,000 model 26650 batteries per day   in Dalian due to increased demands for our model 26650 batteries. As of December 31, 2021, the production line was put into operation. At the same time, the Company continues to renovate its existing facilities, upgrade its equipment, add new equipment, improve its product functionality, and enhance the raw materials and components used for production.



Development of New Battery Models



Currently, our primary battery product offering consists of model 26650, 26700 and 32140 lithium cells which account for approximately 82% of our battery sales in 2021. Model 26650 26700 and 32140 batteries can be used in light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools, energy storage such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) application, and other high-power applications.



To maintain our competitive position, we have developed model 32140 large-sized cylindrical “tabless” battery which is being produced in our Nanjing manufacturing center. Model 32140 batteries can be used in end applications such as light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools and energy storage.

We also announced in February 2021 that we have started the trial production of special 26650 lithium battery, which was designed for application in ultra-low temperature. Capable of operating with high efficiency in low-temperature environments, the special 26650 battery has several use cases in high-latitude and high-altitude low temperature environments, such as energy storage in ultra-low-temperature environment, base stations, transportation, unmanned drones, aviation and aerospace areas, as well as other specific circumstances that require ultra-low-temperature cells.



Acquisition of a Raw Materials Manufacturer 



On July 20, 2021, CBAK Power, a wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary of the Company, entered into a framework agreement relating to CBAK Power’s investment in Zhejiang Hitrans Lithium Battery Technology Co., Ltd, pursuant to which CBAK Power agreed to acquire 81.56% of registered equity interests (representing 75.57% of paid-up capital) of Hitrans (the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition was completed on November 26, 2021.



CBAK Power paid approximately RMB40.74 million ($6.4 million) in cash to acquire 21.56% of registered equity interests (representing 21.18% of paid-up capital) of Hitrans from Hitrans management shareholders. In addition, CBAK Power entered into a loan agreement with Hitrans to lend Hitrans approximately RMB131 million ($20.6 million) (the “Hitrans Loan”) by remitting approximately RMB131 million ($20.6 million) into the account of Shaoxing Intermediate People’s Court to remove the freeze on Zhejiang Meidu Graphene Technology Co., Ltd. (“Meidu Graphene”)’s 60% of registered equity interests (representing 54.39% of paid-up capital) of Hitrans which freeze was imposed as a result of a lawsuit for Hitrans’s failure to make payments in connection with the purchase of land use rights, plants, equipment, pollution discharge permit and other assets (the “Assets”). CBAK Power assigned RMB118 million ($18.5 million) of the Hitrans Loan to Mr. Junnan Ye as consideration for the acquisition of 60% of registered equity interests (representing 54.39% of paid-up capital) of Hitrans from Mr. Ye who, acting as an intermediary, first purchased the 60% of registered equity interests (representing 75.57 % of paid-up capital) of Hitrans from Meidu Graphene. After such assignment, Hitrans shall repay Mr. Ye at least RMB70 million ($10.84 million) within two months of obtaining title to the Assets and the rest RMB48 million ($7.43 million) by December 31, 2021, along with a fixed interest of RMB3.5 million ($0.54 million) which can be reduced by up to RMB1 million ($0.15 million) if the loan is repaid before its due date. Hitrans shall repay the remaining approximately RMB13 million ($2.01 million) of the Hitrans Loan to CBAK Power at an interest rate of 6% per annum. As of January 29, 2022, Hitrans repaid all the loan principal of RMB118 million ($18.5 million) and interest of RMB3.5 million ($0.54 million) to Mr. Ye.



Prior to the Acquisition, CBAK Power and Hangzhou Juzhong Daxin Asset Management Co., Ltd. (“Juzhong Daxin”) entered into a framework investment agreement (the “Letter of Intent”) for a potential acquisition of Hitrans, and CBAK Power paid RMB20 million ($3.10 million) to Juzhong Daxin as a security deposit under the Letter of Intent. On July 27, 2021, Juzhong Daxin returned RMB7 million ($1.1 million) of the security deposit to CBAK Power. The remaining RMB3 million ($0.5 million) had not yet been repaid by Juzhong Daxin up to the date of this report. The Company is still negotiating with Juzhong Daxin, as Juzhong Daxin believes that according to the Security Acquisition Framework Agreement entered into between CBAK Power and Juzhong Daxin, CBAK Power should pay RMB3 million ($0.5 million) as risk premium for facilitating the acquisition. CBAK Power believes it is not reasonable to pay any of the risk premium in accordance with the terms of the agreement and Juzhong Daxin should return RMB3 million ($0.5 million) to CBAK Power. CBAK Power has taken legal action for the outstanding balance.



As part of the Acquisition, Hitrans obtained title to the Assets. Upon the closing of the Acquisition, CBAK Power became the largest shareholder of Hitrans holding 81.56% of its registered equity interests (representing 75.57% of paid-up capital). As required by applicable Chinese laws, CBAK Power is obliged to make capital contributions for the portion of Hitrans’s registered capital subscribed but unpaid in accordance with the articles of association of Hitrans.



We believe that the acquisition of Hitrans is beneficial in enhancing the Company’s competitiveness in the supply chain.



Trends in End Applications of Our Products



Our business, financial condition and results of operations depend on whether end-application manufacturers are willing to use our products. We target the battery markets for light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools, energy storage including but not limited to UPS application, and other high-power electric devices. However, our revenues derived from a specific end-application have been fluctuating depending on various factors such as governmental policies, technological changes, evolving industry standards and customer needs and preferences.



During the period from 2017 to 2019, our largest electric vehicle customers included Dongfeng Autos, Dayun Motor and Yema Auto. Our battery sales in the electric vehicle market have decreased significantly during the period of 2018–2021 as a result of changes to the Chinese government’s new energy vehicle subsidy policies. More specifically, under the subsidy policies, new energy vehicles receive different subsidies based on their driving range and technical performance. New energy vehicles providing long driving range and high technical performance qualify for higher subsidies and the Chinese government has gradually raised the performance thresholds for electric vehicles to receive subsidies over the years. Since 2019, as the battery packs comprising our primary model 26650 batteries were only able to support energy vehicles that qualify for the lowest level of subsidies, electric vehicle producers do not have the incentive to purchase batteries from us. As a result, we had only generated approximately $0.2 million in revenues from electric vehicle customers in 2021. The market where we mainly sell now is the energy storage market. However, we have been looking for opportunities to re-enter the electric vehicle battery market by continuing to develop batteries suitable for electric vehicles and actively cooperating with previous electric vehicle customers in battery pack after-sales service and technical support.

Almost all of our business operations are conducted primarily through our Chinese subsidiaries. The chart below presents our current corporate structure:






Our Products 



The use of new materials has enabled the configuration of high-power lithium battery cells to contain much higher energy density and higher voltage and have a longer life cycle and shorter charge time than other types of lithium-based batteries. These special attributes, coupled with intrinsic safety features, are suitable for batteries used for high-power applications, such as electric cars, electric bicycles, electric tools, and energy storage such as uninterruptible power supply, or UPS application.



We currently are manufacturing the following high power lithium batteries, which can be used for various applications:




Battery Cell Type | End applications* 
---------------------------+-----------------------------------
High-power lithium battery | Electric bus [6,000-20,000] 
 | Electric car [1,500-3,5000] 
 | Hybrid electric vehicle [500-2000]
 | Light electric vehicle [10-150] 
 | Cordless power tool [10-30] 
 | Energy Storage including UPS [>30]


* | Bracketed numbers denote number of cells per particular battery.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

On November 29, 2021, we announced the completion of the acquisition of 81.56% equity interests of Hitrans. We thus incorporate the manufacture and sale of the following materials used in high power lithium batteries as part of our operations:




Material Type | End applications* 
------------------+---------------------------
Cathode | High-power lithium battery
Precursor | Cathode materials 




Precursors are in general made from nickel salts, cobalt salts and manganese salts, and are used in manufacturing cathode materials. Cathode materials are crucial raw materials to manufacture lithium-ion batteries.



Key High Power Lithium Battery Applications



End-product applications that are driving the demand for high power lithium batteries include electric vehicles, such as electric cars, electric buses, hybrid electric cars and buses; light electric vehicles, such as electric bicycles, electric motors, sight-seeing cars; and electric tools, energy storage including but not limited to uninterruptible power supply application, and other high-power applications.
Electric Vehicles



An electric vehicle, sometimes referred to as an electric drive vehicle, uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. Electric vehicles include electric cars, electric buses, electric trains, electric lorries, electric airplanes, electric boats, and hybrid electric vehicles, plug in hybrid electric vehicles and electric spacecraft. Electric cars and electric buses are propelled by one or more electric motors powered by rechargeable battery packs. Electric cars and buses have the potential to significantly reduce city pollution by having zero tail pipe emissions. Electric cars and buses are also expected to have less dependence on oil. World governments are pledging significant funds to fund the development of electric vehicles and their components due in part to these advantages. Due to these factors and a lithium battery’s relatively environmentally-friendly, light-weight and high-capacity features, the demand for lithium batteries in the field of electric cars and buses is increasing.



Due to such recent trends as renewed concerns relating to the availability and price of oil, increased legal fuel-efficiency requirements and incentives, and heightened interest in environmentally-friendly or “green” technologies, hybrid electric vehicles are likely to continue to attract substantial interest from vehicle manufacturers and consumers. Hybrid electric vehicles include automobiles, trucks, buses, and other vehicles that combine a conventional propulsion system with a rechargeable energy storage system to achieve better fuel economy than conventional vehicles. As these vehicles tend to be large and heavy, their rechargeable energy storage system generally consists of a large quantity of rechargeable high-power lithium cells.



The year 2014 was seen as the first real year for the development of China’s new energy vehicle industry by many industry insiders. After explosive growth in 2017, the production and sales of new energy vehicles continued to grow tremendously in 2018, 2020 and 2021, despite of a slightly decline in 2019. According to Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China (“MIIT”), from January to December 2018, the production of new energy vehicles in China reached 1,270,000 units - up 43.4 percent year-on-year; and sales in China reached 1,256,000 units - up 61.7 percent year-on-year. In 2019, the production and sales of new energy vehicles reached 1,242,000 units and 1,206,000 units, down 2.3 percent and 4.0 percent year-on-year, respectively. In 2020, the production and sales of new energy vehicles reached 1,366,000 units and 1,267,000 units, up 10.0 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively, from 2019. In 2021, the production and sales of new energy vehicles continued to grow significantly, reaching a record high of 3,545,000 units and 3,521,000 units, both up almost 1.6 times from last year. The subsidy policy on new energy vehicles is set to be scrapped on December 31, 2022. We believe that Chinese electric vehicle market is adversely impacted by the gradually decreasing subsidy in the short term. In the long term, we believe that the Chinese market for new energy vehicles will gradually grow into a fully competitive market in which new energy vehicles will be rapidly popularized.



Light Electric Vehicles



Light electric vehicles include bicycles, scooters, and motorcycles, with rechargeable electric motors. Due to their relatively small size and light design, approximately 10-150 high-power lithium cells can be used to power light electric vehicles. We believe that the electric bicycle market in China is very large.

Light electric vehicles have drawn great attention from the international market as a solution to the global environment and energy problems. With governments in China, Japan, Europe, South Asia, and North America promoting the application of light electric vehicles, this market has been growing tremendously. Typically, China’s domestic market for light electric vehicles is predicted to peak from 2022 to 2023. China has the world’s biggest electric bicycle market, promoted by the adoption of new “national standard” of electric bicycles by the Chinese government, which leads to a nation-wide upgrading of electric bicycles from old “national standard.” Plus, the popularity of the concept of shared electric bicycles in China further creates momentum to the growth of the market. The pandemic of Covid-19 stimulates the development of food delivery industry that increases the demand for shared electric bicycles. We believe that the adoption of new “national standard” and the increasing demand for shared electric bicycles will rapidly boost the market.



In India, Southeast Asia and European markets, thanks to the carbon emission and pollution reduction policies promoted by local governments, electric vehicles have been viewed as a solution to replace traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. Unlike electric vehicles whose market has already been fully competitive, light electric vehicles including electric bicycles still have a great potential to grow.



Energy Storage & Uninterruptible Power Supplies (“UPS”)



Energy storage mainly means storage of electric energy by battery, inductor, and capacitor. Battery energy storage is mainly used for storage of emergency supply, battery car, and redundant energy of power plants. A UPS is a form of energy storage application. A UPS provides emergency power from a separate source when utility power is not available. The most common type of battery used in UPS is Sealed Lead-Acid, however, due to the lithium battery’s relatively small size, light design and environmentally friendly features, the demand for lithium batteries in this industry is increasing.
Electric Tools



Electric tools such as drills, saws and grinders are used for both commercial and personal use. Due to high power requirements, many electric tools have historically used small combustion engines, used heavier nickel metal hydride batteries or relied on external power sources. Manufacturers of electric tools, such as Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., the Bosch Group, Metabowerke GmbH and Rigid Tool Company have begun to use lithium-ion technology. The market for portable high-powered electric tools is rapidly growing and has prompted many users, both commercial and personal, to replace or upgrade their current power tools.
Sales and Marketing



We plan to build an extensive sales and service network in China, highlighted by our presence in the regions where China’s main lithium battery productions located, such as Tianjin, Shandong Province, Guangdong Province and Jiangsu Province. We intend to gradually establish post-sales service offices in these areas to serve brand owners and pack manufacturers in each designated area as currently our marketing department at headquarters is responsible for our promoting efforts. In doing so, our sales staff works closely with our customers to understand their needs and provide feedback to us so that we can better address their needs and improve the quality and features of our products.



We also engage in marketing activities such as attending industry-specific conferences and exhibitions to promote our products and brand name. We believe these activities are conducive in promoting our products and brand name among key industry participants.

Suppliers  


The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries include electrode materials, cases and caps, foils, electrolyte and separators. The primary raw materials used in our materials business include cobaltous sulfates, manganese sulfates, lithium hydroxides, lithium carbonates and liquid nickel sulfates. Cost of these raw materials is a key factor in pricing our products. We source such raw materials from a couple of suppliers across China. We believe that there is an ample supply of most of the raw materials we need in China. We are seeking to identify alternative raw material suppliers to the extent there are viable alternatives and to expand our use of alternative raw materials.



We aim to maintain multiple supply sources for each of our key raw materials to ensure that supply problems with any one supplier will not materially disrupt our operations. In addition, we strive to develop strategic relationships with new suppliers to secure a stable supply of materials and introduce competition in our supply chain, thereby increasing our ability to negotiate better pricing and reducing our exposure to possible price fluctuations.



Intellectual Property



On August 25, 2014, we entered into an intellectual property rights use agreement with Shenzhen BAK Battery Co., Ltd (“Shenzhen BAK”), pursuant to which we are authorized to use Shenzhen BAK’s registered logo, trademarks and patents obtained as of June 30, 2014 for a period of 5 years for free from June 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2014, Shenzhen BAK had registered 80 trademarks in the PRC, including BAK in both English and in Chinese characters as well as its logo, and had registered 49 trademarks in the United States, European Union, Korea, Russia, Taiwan, India, Canada and Hong Kong. As of June 30, 2014, Shenzhen BAK had registered 522 patents in the PRC and other countries relating to battery cell materials, design and manufacturing processes. As of December 31, 2019, our intellectual property rights use agreement with Shenzhen BAK had expired, and we no longer have rights to use the foregoing trademarks and patents of Shenzhen BAK. We believe that our proprietary patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights are adequate to fulfill our operational needs.



As of December 31, 2021, CBAK Power has 62 patents in the PRC, 2 of which will expire before 2025 while the remaining 60 will expire between 2025 to 2039. Two of these patents were acquired by BAK Asia, from an unrelated third party at RMB1 and were contributed as paid-in capital of CBAK Power. CBAK Energy has 7 patents in the PRC, all of which will expire between 2030 and 2040. Nanjing CBAK has 1 patent in PRC which will expire in 2040. Hitrans has 18 patents in the PRC, all of which will expire between 2026 and 2041.   



We have registered the following Internet and WAP domain name: www.cbak.com.cn.



We also have unpatented proprietary technologies for our product offerings and key stages of the manufacturing process. Our management and key technical personnel have entered into agreements requiring them to keep confidential all information relating to our customers, methods, business and trade secrets during their terms of employment with us and thereafter and to assign to us their inventions, technologies and designs they develop during their term of employment with us.

We have institutionalized our efforts to safeguard our intellectual property rights by establishing an internal department that includes professionals such as attorneys, engineers, information managers and archives managers responsible for handling matters relating to our intellectual property rights. We have published internally a series of rules to protect our intellectual property rights.



While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right.



Seasonality 



Seasonality does not materially affect our business or operating results. As our battery cell and battery material products have a wide range of applications, we have not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in market demands or sales recently. Market demands for our products generally slightly drop during the Chinese New Year holiday, a major national holiday in China.
Customers



Currently, major customers for our high power lithium batteries business include Viessmann Faulquemont S.A.S, ShenZhen ZTS Technology, Co., Ltd., Northvolt Battery System AB and SolaX Power. Major customers for our materials segment include Hunan Brunp  Recycling Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing Easpring Material Technology Co., Ltd. and Farasis Energy (GanZhou) Co., Ltd. We believe that we will continue to increase our revenue and market share as we gradually increase our high-power batteries production as the demand for these batteries has been increasing.
Geography of Sales 



Before June 30, 2014, we sold our products domestically and internationally. Thereafter, we sell high-power lithium battery primarily to customers in China. The following table sets forth certain information relating to our total revenues by location of our customers for the last two fiscal years:

Competition



We face intense competition from high-power lithium battery makers and raw materials manufacturers in China, as well as in Korea and Japan for each of our product types. The following table sets forth our major competitors in the battery market broken down by the EV market, LEV market and UPS market as of December 31, 2021, as well as in the materials market:

Product Type | Competitors | 
--------------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EV battery | Japan: | Panasonic Corporation 
 | Korea: | Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd LG Chemical 
 | China: | Tianjin Lishen Battery Joint-stock Co., Ltd Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd Hefei Guoxuan Hi-Tech Power Energy Co., Ltd China Aviation Lithium Battery Co., Ltd 
LEV battery | China: | Tianneng Power International Limited Chaowei Power Holdings Limited Phylion Battery Co., Ltd

 | China: | Beijing Easpring Material Technology Co., Ltd. Ningbo Ronbay Lithium Battery Material Co., Ltd. 




We believe that we are able to leverage our low-cost advantage to compete favorably with our competitors. Compared to Korean and Japanese battery makers, we are able to source our needs for skilled labor and raw materials locally and economically. Compared to Chinese battery makers, we believe we have higher consistency and safety in product quality, which enables us to compete favorably with local competitors.



Research and Development  


The R&D of next-generation advanced lithium battery and its key materials – characterized by high energy density, high security, long-lasting life, and low cost – as well as the training of related technical talents, have become a major demand in the development of advanced electric vehicles in China.



We have an advanced R&D center in Dalian for lithium battery, receiving almost all the R&D achievements, R&D equipment and staff of BAK Tianjin. BAK Tianjin began its R&D manufacturing and distribution of high-power lithium battery and battery modules in December 2006, for use in electric cars, electric bicycles, UPS, and other applications.



In addition to our efforts to develop new batteries at lower cost and higher energy density, we are also focusing on the research and development of high-nickel low-cobalt materials characterized by high energy density, low cost and broader applications. We have an advanced R&D center in Shaoxing for materials. Besides, significant R&D resources are invested to develop single-crystal high-voltage products as well as high-rate materials which enable 15C discharge rate.



Regulatory Compliance



Environmental Regulations



As we conduct our manufacturing activities in China, we are subject to the requirements of PRC environmental laws and regulations on air emission, wastewater discharge, solid waste and noise. The major environmental regulations applicable to us include the PRC Environmental Protection Law, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Solid Waste Pollution, and the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution. We aim to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We have built environmental treatment facilities concurrently with the construction of our manufacturing facilities, where waste air, wastewater and waste solids we generate can be treated in accordance with the relevant requirements. We outsource the disposal of solid waste we generate in the Dalian facility to a third-party contractor. Certain key materials used in manufacturing, such as cobalt dioxide, electrolyte and separators, have proven innocuous to worker’s health and safety as well as the environment. We are not subject to any admonitions, penalties, investigations or inquiries imposed by the environmental regulators, nor are we subject to any claims or legal proceedings to which we are named as a defendant for violation of any environmental law or regulation. We do not have any reasonable basis to believe that there is any threatened claim, action or legal proceedings against us that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The China Company Law also applies to foreign-invested limited liability companies and foreign-invested companies limited by shares. Pursuant to the China Company Law, where laws on foreign investment have other stipulations, such stipulations shall prevail. In December 2021, the SCNPC issued the draft amendment to the China Company Law for comment. The draft amended China Company Law has made roughly 70 substantive changes to the 13 chapters and 218 articles of the current Company Law (rev. 2018). It would (i) refine special provisions on state-funded companies; (ii) improve the company establishment and exit system; (iii) optimize corporate structure and corporate governance; (iv) optimize the capital structure; (v) tighten the responsibilities of controlling shareholders and management personnel; and (vi) strengthen corporate social responsibility.

The Negative List set out in a unified manner the restrictive measures, such as the requirements on shareholding percentages and management, for the access of foreign investments, and the industries that are prohibited for foreign investment. The Negative List covers 12 industries, and any field not falling in the Negative List shall be administered under the principle of equal treatment to domestic and foreign investment.



The Foreign Investment Law of the People’s Republic of China, or the Foreign Investment Law was promulgated by the NPC in March 2019 and become effective in January 2020. After the Foreign Investment Law came into force, the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises, the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures and the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Sino-foreign Contractual Joint Ventures have been repealed simultaneously. The investment activities of foreign natural persons, enterprises or other organizations (hereinafter referred to as foreign investors) directly or indirectly within the territory of mainland China shall comply with and be governed by the Foreign Investment Law, including: 1) establishing by foreign investors of foreign-invested enterprises in mainland China alone or jointly with other investors; 2) acquiring by foreign investors of shares, equity, property shares, or other similar interests of Chinese domestic enterprises; 3) investing by foreign investors in new projects in mainland China alone or jointly with other investors; and 4) other forms of investment prescribed by laws, administrative regulations or the State Council.



In December 2019, the State Council issued the Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect in January 2020. After the Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law came into effect, the Regulation on Implementing the Law on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures, Provisional Regulations on the Duration of Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Regulations on Implementing the Law on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises and the Regulations on Implementing the Law on Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Ventures have been repealed simultaneously.
