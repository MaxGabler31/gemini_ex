Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this section to “we,” “our,” “us,” “UpHealth,” the “Company” and other similar terms refer to UpHealth, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. See page 25 for a glossary of the terms used throughout this section.
Formation 
UpHealth Services, Inc., was formed on November 5, 2019, and effectively began operations on January 1, 2020. It was formed for the purpose of effecting a combination of various companies engaged in digital health, and commenced negotiations with a number of companies, including those that are discussed below as having been acquired. UpHealth Holdings, Inc. (“UpHealth Holdings”) became the sole shareholder of UpHealth Services, Inc. through a reorganization with UpHealth Services, Inc.’s original shareholders when UpHealth Holdings was formed on October 26, 2020 as a Delaware corporation. UpHealth Holdings then entered into a series of transactions to develop its business across three segments: (a) Integrated Care Management—through its subsidiary Thrasys, Inc. (“Thrasys”); (b)Virtual Care Infrastructure—through its subsidiary Glocal Healthcare Systems Private Limited (“Glocal”); and (c) Services—through its subsidiaries Innovations Group, Inc. (“Innovations Group”), Behavioral Health Services, LLC (“BHS”) and TTC Healthcare, Inc. (“TTC”). On June 9, 2021, UpHealth (fka GigCapital2) acquired UpHealth Holdings and its subsidiaries, which added Cloudbreak Health, LLC (“Cloudbreak”) to the Virtual Care Infrastructure segment. 
Completed Business Combinations 
On June 9, 2021, UpHealth acquired UpHealth Holdings and its subsidiaries, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary, in an exchange of cash, notes, and shares of common stock for all the shares of UpHealth Holdings’ capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the acquisition. The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, which is the equivalent of UpHealth Holdings issuing stock for the net assets of UpHealth, accompanied by a recapitalization, with UpHealth treated as the accounting acquiree. The determination of UpHealth as the accounting acquiree was primarily based on the fact that subsequent to the acquisition, UpHealth Holdings owned a majority of the voting power of the combined company, UpHealth Holdings comprised 75% of the ongoing operations of the combined entity, UpHealth Holdings controlled a majority of the governing body of the combined company, and UpHealth Holdings’ senior management comprised most of the senior management of the combined company. Subsequent to June 9, 2021, the results of operations of UpHealth are consolidated with those of UpHealth Holdings in the UpHealth, Inc. consolidated financial statements provided with this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”).

Business Overview
Our vision is to take healthcare to the next level, a new future achieved by enabling and powering healthcare’s digital transformation. We are creating an integrated offering of technologies and services essential to personalized, affordable and effective care globally. We want everyone to have access to healthcare and the ability to proactively maintain the best possible health for the whole person.
Our mission is to reshape healthcare by transforming the delivery of care and to support healthier communities through population health management software and telehealth technology that connects evidence-based care, coordinated workflows and health services. The companies that became subsidiaries of UpHealth, Inc. offer patient-centric digital health technologies and tech-enabled services to manage health and integrate care across three core capabilities: Integrated Care Management, Virtual Care Infrastructure, and Services. Together, we believe that by integrating the value streams represented across these three product and service lines, we will empower health systems, health plans, employers and government agencies and ministries to improve outcomes, quality, access, and cost of healthcare, as well as address critical unmet needs of patients, providers, payors, and pharmacies. As of December 31, 2021, UpHealth, Inc. served approximately 8 million lives on its integrated care management platform in the United States, provided telehealth services at over 2,300 U.S. healthcare venues, delivered over 3 million minutes of consultation and filled an average of 971 prescriptions per day. We have carefully selected

specific competencies, which we believe will allow us to provide a multifaceted approach to blending technologies and services to enable our stakeholders to “practice” digital health.
Following the completion of the business combinations, we are organized across three strategic capabilities, each with a diverse set of partners and customers and each representing a large and fast growing market segment:
•Integrated Care Management. Our Integrated Care Management business is powered by Thrasys’ SyntraNetTM platform. SyntraNetTM is an end-to-end data integration, analytics, and population health management platform, uniquely architected to create what we call “care communities.” SyntraNetTM integrates and organizes information, provides advanced population-based analytics and predictive models, and automates workflows across health plans, health systems, government agencies, and community organizations. Clinical and community-based care teams use the platform to coordinate programs to address medical, behavioral health, and social factors that affect the health of individuals and populations.
•Virtual Care Infrastructure. Our Global Telehealth platform has two divisions—domestic and international. Our domestic division is powered by Cloudbreak (Martti™), a provider of unified telemedicine solutions and digital health tools aimed at increasing access to healthcare and resolving health disparities across the care continuum. Cloudbreak has one of the largest installed user bases in the nation, performing more than 178,000 encounters per month on over 27,000 video endpoints at over 2,300 healthcare venues across the US. Through its integrated telehealth and language access services, the platform serves as the digital front door to in-hospital care. Cloudbreak provides digital health infrastructure enabling its partners, primarily health systems, hospitals, and clinics, to implement unique, private-label telehealth strategies customized to their specific needs and markets. Our international division is powered by HelloLyf from Glocal, a platform that delivers comprehensive primary care and specialty consultations in India and other developing nations at significantly reduced costs compared to historical means of care delivery. Glocal combines its HelloLyf information technology platform with various types of infrastructure, including technology-enabled digital hospitals and clinics, to provide patients with access to affordable care. Its technologies and services are performing over 140,000 digital health encounters per month with contracts now in place that, if fully-implemented, would significantly increase this number by the end of 2022.

•Services. Our Services platform provides pharmacy and behavioral health services in the United States which are critically important to managing whole person care and its associated costs. Our digital pharmacy is powered by MedQuest Pharmacy, a full-service retail and compounding pharmacy licensed in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia that dispenses prescribed medications shipped directly to patients. It is capable of serving as a retail or national fulfillment center. Over the last five years, MedQuest Pharmacy has filled prescriptions for over 5,000 prescribers and over 65,000 patients. Through the Innovations Group suite of companies, other services and products are also available, such as lab and testing services, nutraceuticals, nutritional supplements, education for medical practitioners, and training for individuals and groups. Additionally, our comprehensive behavioral health capabilities are powered by TTC Healthcare and BHS, which together provide evidence-based and tech-enabled behavioral health and substance abuse services via onsite care delivery and telehealth. The division’s physician-led clinical model has a proven approach to networking with a growing panel of providers, which is critically important in the field of mental health. Our Services platform is working to deliver an increasing volume of services, including telehealth services, to existing customers of the Integrated Care Management and Virtual Care Infrastructure platforms. 
When successfully integrated, our digital health platform will go beyond one-off point solutions to connect multiple parts of the healthcare service continuum. Our integrated care system enables personalized, evidence-based clinical decisions through integrated care management that oversees the entire patient experience to enable better outcomes. Today, care is normally delivered by numerous different unconnected providers and results in suboptimal outcomes and disparities in access to healthcare services – our product offering intends to narrow this gap. As we integrate our digital health platform, our goal is to provide better outcomes, an improved care experience, and more manageable costs.
We understand that our constituents, consisting of payors, providers, and patients, want and need more comprehensive, integrated solutions, but are at different points on their digital transformation journey. We seek to meet them where they are today to help them reshape healthcare delivery through the use of intelligent technology, workflows, and service coordination. 
Our highly scalable platform and infrastructure, developed by industry visionaries, has allowed for the establishment of an expansive footprint both domestically and internationally. In the U.S., the partners and customers of our platforms span across more than 2,300 healthcare venues. Our Integrated Care Management platform serves the largest public health plan in the nation as well as thousands of physicians and post-acute sites. MedQuest Pharmacy has pharmacy licenses in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Internationally, Glocal provides digital primary care and specialty consultations under contracts with government ministries across India and other developing countries which, when combined with our the population health

management capabilities of our Integrated Care Management platform, we believe positions us to be a market leader in global telehealth.
Market Opportunity
The 2020 World Health Organization Global Report measured the global healthcare market at $8 trillion, including public and private spending and ranging across the spectrum of healthcare services. We believe that this market is broken, fragmented, and in great need of change. According to government data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), national health expenditure in the United States alone was $4 trillion in 2018, representing 17.7% of GDP.
The long-standing macro factors that are driving the healthcare landscape today and straining current systems include an increasingly aging population, growing prevalence of chronic illnesses, unsustainable and escalating costs, and inequitable access to care. While these are not novel challenges, they are accelerating rapidly and exacerbating fundamental flaws in an inefficient healthcare system ill-equipped to provide the necessary services for all its constituents.
We believe there is a heightened demand for technology solutions that can improve the management of population health and care delivery, eventually leading to the “practice” of digital health. We believe these advancements are leading to a convergence of technology, information, and connectivity to improve health care and health outcomes. We intend to reshape the landscape of the healthcare industry, positioning UpHealth as an indispensable partner to payors, providers and patients as they evolve to the practice of digital health.
Our offerings will be at the center of population health management and telehealth in three of the fastest growing digital healthcare markets:
•Integrated Care Management. Our Integrated Care Management business operates in part within the chronic care management market, a $346 billion global market in 2019 that is expected to grow at a 7.2% CAGR through 2024 according to a 2019 BCC market research report evaluating the global market for chronic disease management. Six out of ten adults in the U.S. have a chronic disease and four out of ten have more than one condition, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”). Individuals living with chronic conditions are intensive users of health and social care services, and the associated costs tend to be significantly higher than those of the average patient. In the U.S., 81% of hospital admissions, 91% of prescriptions, and 76% of physician visits are attributable to managing chronic conditions, according to a report from Modern Healthcare titled, “Behavioral Health: Fixing a System in Crisis.” Our Integrated Care Management segment is expected to grow rapidly based on the expansion of services and volumes under existing contracts and from recently signed new agreements.
Table of Contents

•Virtual Care Infrastructure. Demand for and the use of telehealth services is expanding rapidly as a result of trends in deregulation and broad societal shifts in terms of technology adoption which have both been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a May 2020 McKinsey article titled, “Telehealth: A quarter-trillion-dollar post-COVID-19 reality?”, up to $250 billion of current U.S. healthcare spend could potentially be virtualized through the acceleration of consumer and provider adoption beyond virtual urgent care. We believe telehealth enables more efficient allocation and utilization of finite clinical resources and appeals to both an aging population that requires more complex and chronic care, as well as to a younger generation that prefers digital technology to in-person visits. Improving whole person care and meeting tremendous disparities in access to healthcare requires going beyond simple teleconsultations. Our Virtual Care Infrastructure services in the U.S. and international markets, primarily India, provide access to various aspects of care which is a precursor to effectively managing care. Cloudbreak’s installed base of over 27,000 video endpoints in the U.S. facilitates millions of minutes per year of healthcare services. Glocal’s digital clinics can provide a full patient encounter complete with physical exam, diagnostic testing, and dispensing of medications in addition to a teleconsultation with a remote physician. This capacity to provide complete hybrid digital health encounters at low cost creates access to massive markets for complete primary care and specialty consultations both inside and outside of the U.S.
•Services. Managing the quality and costs of pharmacy products and behavioral health services is an integral part of managing population health. According to a 2019 Deloitte article titled, “Focus and Transformation - Accelerating and Change in Life Sciences,” prescription drug sales are projected to grow at a 6.4% CAGR from 2018 to 2024 and reach $1.2 trillion in 2024. Pre-pandemic, there was a growing demand for mail-order medicines that coincided with increasing penetration of e-commerce and literacy regarding internet resources. Millennials in particular are highly reliant on online procurement for OTC medicines. This growth in adoption was accelerated rapidly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our digital pharmacy, which was recently expanded in terms of capacity, is poised to capitalize on this growth in demand while also serving as the pharmacy of choice across our broader platform. Additionally, behavioral health conditions consisting of mental and substance abuse disorders have societal, economic and healthcare system implications, all of which are amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, one in two Americans had faced a mental health issue or substance abuse disorder at some point in their lives according to an August 2020 McKinsey article titled, “A holistic approach for the U.S. behavioral health crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic.” Those coping with behavioral health conditions have a medical spend that is two to four times higher than the rest of the population, according to recent data from McKinsey. Due to the relatively simplistic conversion from office visits to telepsychiatry, we believe our tech-enabled behavioral health capability is well positioned to capture share in this fast-growing segment within telemedicine.
Impact of COVID-19
The promise of telemedicine, telehealth, and now digital health have been long discussed as solutions to the pervasive issues challenging the effective delivery of healthcare around the world. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced patients and providers alike to embrace digital health technologies at a more rapid pace and accelerated the digital transformation of healthcare to bridge local and digital care delivery and engage displaced patient populations. According to a July 2021 McKinsey article titled, “Telehealth a quarter trillion dollar post Covid reality,” telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38 times higher than before the pandemic. After an initial spike to more than 32% of office and outpatient visits occurring via telehealth in April 2020, utilization levels have largely stabilized, ranging from 13 to 17% across all specialties.
Major shifts in regulations, technology, industry orientation, and reallocation of risk across the value chain have fundamentally altered the structure of the industry and basis of competition. Advancements in medical science, data analytics, machine learning, networking technology, internet access, and the shift in consumer expectations driving business-to-consumer (“B2C”) models have all facilitated the transition to digital health technologies.
We believe there is work to be done in order to solidify the long-term shift to the “practice” of digital health and to capitalize on the opportunity to virtualize $250 billion of U.S. healthcare spending annually. According to a May 2020 McKinsey article titled, “Telehealth: A quarter-trillion-dollar post-COVID-19 reality?”, the adoption of telehealth and extension of telehealth beyond virtual urgent care will require new ways of working with a broad set of providers, step-change improvements in information exchange, and broadening access to integration of technology. This is where we intend to position our business and how we aim to power the adoption of digital health solutions well beyond the pandemic.

Virtual Care Infrastructure—U.S.-Based
Our domestic Virtual Care Infrastructure offering is delivered by Cloudbreak (Martti™). Cloudbreak is dedicated to building solutions that address healthcare disparities impacting patients across the U.S. From telehealth visits to extended hospital stays, Cloudbreak’s digital solutions help patients and providers connect through translation services, building necessary rapport while, most importantly, increasing the efficacy of healthcare. The platform enables providers to deliver and patients to receive effective care at any time, any place, and on any device, regardless of a possible language barrier.
Cloudbreak, originally developed as the premier virtual language interpretation service, is today a unified telehealth platform. Cloudbreak has built one of the largest installed bases in the nation, simplifying how providers care for patients, putting a full care continuum at their fingertips 24/7, and enabling local healthcare systems to build their integrated telemedicine strategy. Cloudbreak offers more than 250 languages on its video interpretation platform, which includes over 27,000 customer end points, and ranks in the top 50 of the 2021 Nimdzi 100 ranking of the largest language service providers in the world. As of December, 31, 2021, Cloudbreak was performing more than 178,000 encounters per month, through seamless integration with a multitude of platforms including Zoom, Epic and AmWell, at over 2,300 healthcare venues nationwide. From telepsychiatry, telestroke, teleICU, teleurology, and other specialties to integrated language services, Cloudbreak’s innovative, secure platform overcomes both distance and language barriers to improve care, satisfaction, and outcomes. 
Cloudbreak, at its core, is a modularly configurable software engine that supports video and audio communications. The Cloudbreak Consult allows healthcare providers to answer calls, place calls, care for patients, converse with the care team, and connect with a qualified interpreter – all from one location. Cloudbreak has expanded its operations by leveraging its existing platform to include other telemedicine use cases such as telestroke, telepsychiatry, teleurology, and telequarantine, among 
Table of Contents

others. Cloudbreak has also recently launched a home health virtual visit platform enabling its healthcare system partners to see their patients remotely on any device, at anytime, anywhere the patient may be, and in any language they may speak.
•Connect Anywhere—Virtual Visit Platform: Providers and patients can connect with a virtual consultation from anywhere, enabling the exchange of messages between providers and patients, and can invite other health professionals or family members to visit virtually and view medical history and/or care plans. Providers also have the ability to view their schedules and patients have the ability to view educational content and videos while waiting for their visit.
•Martti™ Interpretation: Cloudbreak’s core offering, known as Martti™ is a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) compliant video remote interpreting solution that puts qualified and certified medical interpreters supporting more than 250 languages at the fingertips of clinical care teams nationwide through Cloudbreak’s proprietary software platform. Cloudbreak pioneered the Video Remote interpreting industry in 2003 and today is a well-recognized market leader known for the ease of use, high quality and superior customer service associated with its telehealth offerings.
•Telehealth Interoperability: Cloudbreak has built specific integrations that allow hospital staff to initiate Martti™ sessions from their video platforms, enabling multi-specialty call capabilities in one video session, shared content and whiteboarding, and integrations with numerous hospital system Electronic Medical Record (“EMR”), Picture Archive and Communication System (“PACS”), and Remote Patient Monitoring (“RPM”) platforms. Cloudbreak has invested significantly in its interoperability capabilities and continues to be a market leader in providing access to its Video Medical solution on rapidly growing platforms. Cloudbreak has not only integrated with EMRs, but also with other telemedicine and communication solutions throughout the continuum of care.
Cloudbreak provides a unified telehealth experience that harmonizes disparate use cases, allowing providers to efficiently collaborate and communicate, regardless of end-point device or tech infrastructure. Cloudbreak has designed its platform to integrate the clinical and operational workflows of its partners, ensuring that the technology molds to how the clinical teams work, not the other way around. Platforms like Zoom, Teams, and others are “point solution” video platforms with minimal workflow capabilities. Cloudbreak makes these platforms “smart” by embedding them in custom patient and provider experiences based on how a specific health system or medical group practices. In doing so, Cloudbreak’s solutions can be integrated into daily practice patterns with less friction, thus speeding up adoption as well as avoiding commoditization and allowing health systems, clinics, and physicians to differentiate themselves in the market based on their brand and how they practice.
Cloudbreak offers an expanding suite of telehealth use cases, which are delivered under multi-year contracts that include fixed minimums with upside attributable to usage-based fees. Its client base spans the entire healthcare continuum, including hospitals and health systems, federally qualified healthcare clinics (“FQHCs”), urgent care centers, stand-alone clinics and medical practices as well as employers and schools.
Virtual Care Infrastructure—International
UpHealth, Inc.’s international Virtual Care Infrastructure offerings are delivered by Glocal, which provides comprehensive primary care and specialty consultations for a fraction of the cost of alternative delivery systems. Glocal uses its proprietary HelloLyf technology architecture in conjunction with its app and onsite hospitals and digital clinics to uniquely deliver high quality, cost effective care to vulnerable rural and dense urban centers, while also meeting the needs of more affluent communities.
Glocal has used a three-pronged strategy to refine and execute its care delivery. First, it has implemented a lean design approach, by removing non-value add steps that do not directly affect healthcare delivery or outcomes. Second, Glocal has employed evidence-based medicine, including only interventions that have evidence of effectiveness. Third, it has leveraged technology, including Internet-of-Things (“IoT”) and artificial intelligence, to improve diagnosis and management of diseases and to automate standard clinical processes to reduce costs and errors.
Glocal’s spectrum of offerings can be grouped into three major components:
1.The core of UpHealth’s Virtual Care Infrastructure operations internationally is Glocal’s HelloLyf platform. HelloLyf is an advanced technology platform which combines clinical workflows, decision support, and guided protocols to improve the efficacy and cost of care.  Glocal’s digital health interface for patients and providers is driven by its HelloLyf App, a virtual on-demand clinic for identifying patients and automated teleCRM. HelloLyf serves as the care platform for Glocal’s various technology enabled infrastructure assets, including its hospitals and digital clinics. HelloLyf’s clinical decision support system is called LitmusDX and includes differential diagnosis, investigation, and treatment protocols. LitmusDX is cloud-based, regularly updated, and cross-checked to ensure the latest in evidence-
Table of Contents

based protocols. It is a semantic-based engine for accurate differential diagnosis covering over 960 diseases, 8,000 symptoms, 11,000 signs, 300 risk factors, and 450 parameters. Over 440 treatment protocols are referenced, covering most diseases, and it has stored more than 50,000 prescription brands covering over 6,500 formulations. LitmusDX also references more than 20,000 drug precautions, which cover contraindications, drug interactions, adverse reactions, and food and alcohol interactions to reduce medical errors.
2.Glocal’s digital dispensaries, HelloLyf CX, are carefully engineered in a number of different configurations to deliver critical healthcare services in locations where access to primary care and complementary services is constrained. Glocal, by combining its HelloLyf technology with physical IoT devices, can deliver care in as little as 250 sq. ft. of rented or owned space. Such digital dispensaries utilize the services of the local equivalent of a nurse or nurse practitioner and provide interface with doctors virtually via HelloLyf. These digital dispensaries serve as comprehensive care delivery sites wherein nearly all tests can be done, all kinds of doctors accessed, and medicines dispensed.
Within each digital dispensary is Glocal’s LitmusMX, a primary health terminal with remote examination and instant diagnostics capabilities, and LitmusRX, an automated medicine dispenser that provides access for patients in remote cities and towns. LitmusMX accommodates a wide range of primary and emergency healthcare needs within a remarkably compact device. It facilitates a medical examination via a digital stethoscope, fetal doppler, dermatoscope, otoscope, laryngoscope, and nasalscope, in addition to taking blood pressure, temperature, and other vitals.
Table of Contents

LitmusRX is a remote controlled dispensing unit that electronically controls drug dispensing, scalable up to 120 SKUs. A prescription generated by a physician is automatically dispensed by the machine, which helps to reduce medical errors around branding and dosage. LitmusRX also performs real-time inventory management, reducing the need for manual audits and automating supply chain order levels.
Glocal’s  digital dispensary/clinic solution has earned the UN Health Innovation Exchange Public Appreciation 2020 Award, the World Economic Forum 2020 Schwab Foundation Social Entrepreneur Award, and the Frost & Sullivan Indian Telemedicine Customer Value 2020 Leadership Award. Additionally, it has been recognized as among the Top 50 Covid responders by the World Economic Forum, and Glocal was recently given the “Company of the Year - Healthcare” Award by TV9 & SAP India.
3.Glocal’s acute care hospitals have been designed and set up as eleven modular hospitals, each with a three-bed ER, twenty-bed ICU, four operating theaters (including one with Laminar Air Flow systems, 4Slice CT Scan, X Ray, Echo, Color Doppler, and Ultrasound), treadmill stress testing, two to four dialysis units, a complete clinical lab, pharmacy, general ward beds, and private rooms. These compact hospitals are compliant with local clinical establishment code norms, infection control systems, medical gas pipeline, national building codes, and green building norms. They focus on acute cases like trauma, neurotrauma, pacemaking, thrombolysis, acute surgeries, medical emergencies, and also routine surgeries. 
Glocal has also designed and developed a fully digital 200 bed acute care hospital, using IoT, EMR, CDSS, HIS, and pre-engineered technologies. The first such digital 200 bed acute care hospital was built for the Government of Nagaland in Dimapur, India, and construction was completed in 100 days. Glocal expects to deliver more digital hospitals in the future. Glocal’s digital hospital completes the full continuum of care offering from App to digital clinic to acute care facility, all leveraging the HelloLyf technology platform and ancillary digital technologies to improve healthcare delivery.

Glocal offers a full continuum of virtual and in-person care in India and other developing countries, in part under  multi-year contracts that have both a fixed subscription component and volume-based revenue. Glocal’s markets consist of billions of people representing rapid expansion opportunities and target customers, such as government ministries, payors, and stakeholders managing at-risk patient populations where access to care is a challenge.
Services
UpHealth’s Services platform provides pharmacy and behavioral health services on a fee-for-service basis to patients across the U.S. Pharmacy and behavioral health services are an integral aspect of managing population health and our Services platform will increasingly focus on providing high quality, cost effective care to customers of our Integrated Care Management and Virtual Care Infrastructure platforms. 
The Service platform's digital pharmacy business is delivered by Innovations Group's MedQuest Pharmacy, a full-service retail pharmacy that is licensed in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. MedQuest delivers both compounded and legend drugs, and is capable of either serving as a retail or national fulfillment center, as a personalized medication administration partner with prescribers, and as a lifestyle wellness direct-to-consumer offering. Its proprietary software and operating system, eMedplus, is Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances (“EPCS”) Certified by the United States Drug Enforcement Association (“DEA”) and provides prescribers with a full-service prescription management system.
MedQuest Pharmacy is accredited and recognized by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care and its Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board, among other high-quality providers and suppliers. MedQuest Pharmacy has achieved this elite level of quality by exceeding standards set by national accreditation bodies and quality-centered organizations. MedQuest recently invested approximately $3.8 million in a facility expansion and, is poised for growth as capital is directed to developing new product lines (such as dermatology products) and expanding its testing services with new and existing lab companies and relationships. In addition, eMedplus, MedQuest’s proprietary software and operating system, became Surescripts certified (Surescripts' process to validate that the software meets certain industry standards related to sending and receiving electronic messages and that it is providing open choice for medication selection and dispensing locations) in January 2020, allowing any user of the Surescripts platform to prescribe medications dispensed by MedQuest Pharmacy. Under an agreement between MedQuest Pharmacy and Surescripts, MedQuest Pharmacy pays Surescripts a nominal fee for certain messages (e.g., new prescriptions or refill requests) sent through the Surescripts system. The majority of MedQuest’s Pharmacy’s prescriptions, however, are dispensed through eMedplus or through verbal, mailed, or faxed order requests.
MedQuest Pharmacy’s comprehensive  pharmacy capabilities support direct-to-patient shipping of both manufactured and compounded drugs. MedQuest Pharmacy’s relationships are with both prescribers and patients and it filled an average of approximately 971 prescriptions per day in 2021. Over the last five years, MedQuest Pharmacy has filled prescriptions for over 5,000 prescribers and over 65,000 patients. MedQuest’s current business model is driven by cash-pay and prescription volume-based revenue generated by physician electronic prescription order entry, as well as traditional prescriber-patient-pharmacist interactions, including mailed, verbal, and faxed orders. MedQuest will increasingly focus on providing managed pharmacy-related services to existing and new customers of our Integrated Care Management and Virtual Care Infrastructure platforms.
Innovations Group’s suite of services also includes WorldLink Medical, Inc., Medical Horizons, Inc., and Pinnacle Labs, Inc. (“MedQuest Testing Services”) which work in concert with MedQuest Pharmacy. WorldLink Medical, Inc. is an educational services partner of Innovations Group, and provides CME educational courses accredited as a joint provider through the ACCME. Medical Horizons, Inc. specializes in customized formulations, dietary supplements and nutraceuticals as an own-label distributor with its brand NUTRAscriptives, as well as other brands. Its turnkey solutions include label design, printing, and application; custom packaging; daily packs; a selection of capsule sizes and colors; and convenient auto-reorder services. Medical Horizons employs a staff of experts that is committed to excellence and outstanding customer service. MedQuest Testing Services focuses specifically on facilitating diagnostic testing between lab companies, patients, and providers.
UpHealth’s behavioral health business is anchored by TTC Healthcare and BHS, two high-quality, evidence-based behavioral health and substance abuse providers rapidly innovating in the virtual care space. While TTC Healthcare and BHS today operate largely independently, work is underway to integrate the substance abuse treatment expertise of TTC Healthcare with the adult behavioral health services of BHS to form a comprehensive model of care ready to scale to a national level.
We believe we are positioned to leverage the technology solutions found in our other platforms to reshape how behavioral and substance abuse care is delivered in the future. Examples include the full integration of the telehealth consult solution by Cloudbreak and the personalized medication regimens available through MedQuest Pharmacy into our behavioral health offerings. In addition, our physician-led clinical models have proven successful in growing a panel of providers, which is critically important in the underserved and understaffed field of mental health.
Table of Contents

TTC Healthcare’s treatment facilities are licensed by the Florida Department of Children and Family Services and the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration, and maintain the industry’s most widely acknowledged accreditation by the Joint Commission. TTC Healthcare offers a complete continuum of care from our detoxification services, residential care, Partial Hospitalization Programs (“PHP”), intensive outpatient (“IOP”), and outpatient programs (“OP”). During the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatient programs included a significant percentage of virtual visits. UpHealth’s behavioral health offerings also include Medication-Assisted Treatment where appropriate.
TTC’s PHP is a full day of clinical treatment in a structured environment, while the client is living in supportive housing that offers 24-hour supervision, nursing services, and an on-call therapist. PHP is an opportunity for the client to experience more structured clinical care, addressing their primary and secondary issues and diagnoses. Clients are able to attend 12-step or mental health support groups in the evenings, as well as enjoy activities and recovery events on the weekends. Much like TTC Healthcare’s other treatment programs, each client has an individualized treatment plan that is unique to their needs and recovery goals.
An IOP is a transitional level of care where the client begins to reintegrate into normal life with less therapy time, but still with the full support of TTC Healthcare staff. Clients will collaborate with their therapists and peers on the best recovery practices and how to deal with triggers in the real world. How long a client participates in an intensive outpatient program varies depending on the needs of each individual and this allows for a treatment schedule to be customized, fitting with the clients’ lives outside of treatment.
The OP offers limited counseling sessions for clients on a weekly basis. Those who participate in the outpatient program live at home or in some type of sober living housing, which is one of the main differences between outpatient and inpatient care. The services offered are very similar, but the time spent in therapy sessions is less in outpatient care.
Finally, Medication-Assisted Treatment (“MAT”) involves a pharmacological approach to treating addiction, primarily addiction to opioids, including heroin, and prescription narcotics. MAT-related medications reduce the difficult physical symptoms surrounding withdrawal, thereby helping an individual remain engaged in treatment and can be a particularly effective treatment model for opioid use disorders. MAT programs that combine medication, counseling and therapy are largely considered one of the strongest evidence-based modalities to combat addiction. This type of treatment ultimately complements an abstinence-based program. The recommendation for MAT is based on a thorough and individualized assessment of the person in treatment and their specific needs. 
BHS is a Missouri-based mental health practice consisting of over fifty psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, psychologists, and other mental health providers in four physical locations. BHS providers work in collaboration with multiple area hospital systems (both in leadership and clinical positions) to provide and direct inpatient treatment. BHS offers in-office, virtual, and in-patient treatment to an average of over 7,000 unique patients per month. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic approximately 95% of BHS’ outpatient and post-acute care consults were done virtually. While the transition to virtual treatment had long been anticipated, the pandemic led to BHS’s adoption of virtual health delivery literally overnight. The flexibility of this new treatment format has been well received by both clinicians and providers. Virtual provision of psychiatric care has allowed an expansion of BHS’s patient base to both individuals as well as to long term care settings. 
Common conditions treated by BHS practitioners include depression, bipolar disorder, attention disorders, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders, as well as personality disorders.
BHS providers are all state-licensed and most of its physicians are board-certified and provide comprehensive psychiatric treatment utilizing psycho-pharmacology, evidenced-based psychotherapy, as well as somatic treatments like Ketamine therapy, Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation, and Electro-Convulsive Therapy. The variety of provider disciplines available within BHS allows for ready collaboration and consultation between practitioners.
BHS has established its own pharmacy service which specializes in psychiatric medications and the unique needs of these patients from both a clinical and payor perspective. This pharmacy is able to function efficiently from both its physical location as well as a virtual provider. Plans are to further integrate this service with the broader digital pharmacy capabilities found in MedQuest Pharmacy.
Given the idiosyncratic nature of behavioral health reimbursement and credentialing, BHS established its own in-house billing department (Reimbursement Solutions). This subsidiary has allowed for both more efficient payment for BHS clinicians and has provided a billing service that has been successfully marketed to outside practices. Reimbursement Solutions’ capacities are available to leverage for third-party billing services across the divisions and companies.

Operations
Our principal executive offices are located in Delray Beach, Florida. We also have centers of operation in California, Missouri, Ohio, Utah, and West Bengal, India. We intend to procure additional space as we add employees and expand geographically. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future, and that, should it be needed, suitable additional space will be available to accommodate any such expansion.
Our leadership team is comprised of industry experts and innovators with extensive healthcare, technology, and organizational knowledge. Our leaders have decades of experience founding, building and successfully scaling private and public companies. Our Board of Directors is co-chaired by UpHealth co-founders Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria and Dr. Avi Katz. We are led by CEO Ramesh Balakrishnan. Our Integrated Care Management, Virtual Care Infrastructure, and Services capabilities will continue to be led by the executive officers of the businesses that comprise them. Key corporate services such as finance, human resources, sales, marketing and research and development are aligned under our executive team.
As of December 31, 2021, (a) UpHealth corporate had 20 full-time employees and 1 contractor; (b) Cloudbreak had 367 employees, including 157 full-time employees, and 210 contractors; (c) Innovations Group had 115 employees, including 92 full-time employees, and no contractors; (d) TTC Healthcare had 282 employees, including 254 full-time employees, and 9 contractors; (e) Glocal had 821 employees, including 256 full-time employees, and 565 contractors; (f) Thrasys had 53 employees, including 51 full-time employees, and 2 contractors; and (g) BHS had 88 employees, including 52 full-time employees, and 36 contractors.
Key Performance Indicators
As a digital health technology and tech-enabled services company, we measure several key performance indicators across our platform related to adoption and utilization by users. We believe that the following key performance indicators (“KPIs”) will impact our ability to improve the health of patients and help to inform how we manage operations:
•Number of lives
Our mission is to transform care delivery and support healthier individuals and communities. We believe that our digital health technology and tech-enabled services support this mission by empowering providers to deliver coordinated, personalized, affordable, and effective care globally to improve health outcomes. The number of lives served globally helps to assess our performance managing to that mission as well as our potential impact on the broader healthcare market. As of December 31, 2021, UpHealth, Inc. had approximately 8 million lives served in integrated care management in the United States.
•Number of care venues
We believe that the number of care venues using our platform globally is an indicator of future revenue growth because we derive meaningful revenue from consultation, diagnostic, and medication dispensing fees, as well as 
Table of Contents

device utilization in the care venues we serve. These venues also provide a base footprint unto which we can provide other products and services across our platform. A care venue represents a distinct physical location of a medical care site, hospital, or health system. As of December 31, 2021, UpHealth, Inc. had approximately 2,363 distinct care venues globally. 
•Number of encounters
Because our service and utilization revenue will generally increase with the number of consultations, we believe the number of global (domestic and internationally) consultations provides investors with useful information on period-to-period performance as evaluated by management, and comparison with our past financial performance. We define core consultations as encounters as patients and provider utilizing our core services, including digital encounter teleconsultations and onsite consultations. MedQuest Pharmacy filled an average of approximately 971 prescriptions per day in 2021. Over the last five years, MedQuest Pharmacy has filled prescriptions for over 5,000 prescribers and over 65,000 patients. As a valued partner to prescribers, we believe both measures provide good insight into the level of penetration into the prescriber community. As of December 31, 2021, UpHealth, Inc. had approximately 2.7 million consultations globally. 
We believe our operational performance will drive our financial results, which will be evaluated at the corporate and divisional level. Our key financial metrics to which we manage include revenue, gross margin, and adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”). As we expand our role as a partner for key stakeholders in the practice of digital health, we anticipate developing a set of shared performance indicators, such as impact on total cost of care, functional health of members and targeted populations, and satisfaction level of the care experience by providers, customers, and payors.
Growth Opportunities
UpHealth, Inc. has proven solutions with significant revenue and customer momentum, as well as numerous opportunities to achieve synergistic growth. Leading this transformational effort is an executive team with world class academic and operational pedigrees, confident in its ability to lead change at the forefront of healthcare delivery. In addition to executing on the organic growth initiatives of each of the business lines, there are numerous synergistic opportunities ongoing, as well as de novo product launches planned near-term.
Below are the levers through which we believe UpHealth will accelerate growth of the platform:
•Implement Executed/Signed Contracts. The companies that make up the Virtual Care Infrastructure and Integrated Care Management lines have won meaningful contracts in 2021 and are expected to drive substantial new revenue in 2022 and beyond. Internationally, Glocal has won significant contracts in Madhya Pradesh (India), which are expected to drive revenue growth between 2022 and 2023. Domestically, Cloudbreak continued to expand its reach across U.S. health systems, with recent large wins at Yale New Haven Health, RWJ Barnabas, and Ascension Health, resulting in approximately $10 million in annualized bookings. Our Integrated Care Management business, which signs initial multi-year contract terms with recurring revenue, covered 8 million lives in 2021.
•Drive New Bookings. The Virtual Care Infrastructure and Integrated Care Management segments are involved in late-stage negotiations with health systems and government ministries to expand both domestically and internationally. We will continue to pursue these opportunities and leverage the strength and breadth of our combined platform to drive continued bookings growth. Additionally, several of our businesses have historically scaled conservatively and profitably, with minimal investment in sales and marketing. As a combined entity, we expect to meaningfully increase our investment in our go-to-market functions to capitalize on both synergies across the platform, as well as take advantage of the accelerated adoption of telehealth services.
•Explore Synergistic Opportunities with Existing Clients. UpHealth provides a suite of products across the continuum of care for any entity managing complex patient populations. This enables UpHealth to become a strategic partner for health systems, government entities, and plans, providing services from integrated care management to digital pharmacy capabilities. We are positioned to offer the market a unique, multifaceted and integrated approach to technologies, processes, and services spanning the continuum of care, which creates numerous synergy opportunities across our businesses. As a customer uses UpHealth’s available solutions, the platform will be able to further utilize its growing network and dataset to help provide even better care to a greater population. For example, our care management, behavioral health, and digital pharmacy operations now have the opportunity to leverage the 2,300+ U.S. healthcare venues that are currently utilizing our domestic telehealth services.
•Product, Service and Partner Expansion. Innovation leading to new products and services are continuously and intentionally planned. In 2022, MedQuest Pharmacy’s full-service compounding and retail Digital Pharmacy plans to add new lines of specialty focus, such as dermatology, and Medical Horizons launched NUTRAscriptivesTM, an e-commerce platform to allow providers to sell Medical Horizons’ nutraceutical supplements line to their patients. 
Table of Contents

Additionally, our behavioral health platform plans to expand telepsychiatry services in conjunction with Cloudbreak by leveraging Cloudbreak’s relationships with over 2,300 care venues. Innovative features of our international telemedicine digital dispensary and AI-guided-evidence-based care solution will be reengineered to enable introduction into U.S. and other developed international markets. Cloudbreak will continue to roll out specific teleconsultation applications beyond telepsychiatry and telestroke. Each of these initiatives are expected to provide meaningful revenue opportunities.
•Strategic Acquisition. We will investigate supplementing our organic growth strategy with select acquisitions to increase market share across our current capabilities, accelerate entry into new capabilities, and expand offerings into new end markets. We plan to be opportunistic with respect to building our existing capabilities within the three core markets and channels. We will continue to selectively evaluate and, where strategically appropriate, pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary.
Competition
The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, with increasing competition from new entrants and expansion by existing competitors. We view our competitors as companies that currently, or in the future will, (i) develop and market digital health technology (devices and systems) or (ii) provide telehealth and expert medical services, such as the delivery of on-demand access to healthcare. Competition for developing and marketing digital health technology and the provision of telehealth focuses on, among other factors, technology, breadth and depth of functionality, range of associated care delivery services, operational experience, customer support, size of customer base, and reputation. As we have indicated, our platform operates across three major markets (Integrated Care Management, Virtual Care Infrastructure, and Services) and our key competitors span those markets. Key competitors in the integrated care management sector include Innovaccer, Arcadia, Cerner, and Health Catalyst. Key competitors in the provision of telehealth and expert medical services include One Medical, CVS, LifeStance Health, Amwell, Teladoc Health, and Language Line Solutions. Key competitors in the Services sector include MDLive, Ontrak, and K Health.
In the health system market, electronic health record (“EHR”) companies could be considered competitors, but many have chosen to partner with the U.S.-based telehealth offering by Cloudbreak and integrate Cloudbreak’s capabilities into their own products. Competition also comes from large communications software companies who offer an entry-level priced and simplified offering for telehealth. Newer competitors include companies who provide asynchronous chat communications. Competition may also increase from large technology companies that may wish to develop their own telehealth solutions, as well as from large retailers that seek to digitize their healthcare integrated offerings. With the emergence of COVID-19, we have also seen increased competition from consumer-grade video solutions. We believe that the breadth of our existing and planned client ecosystem, the depth of our technology platform, and our business-to-business focus on promoting existing healthcare brands and integrating freely with multiple platforms increases the likelihood that stakeholders seeking to develop telehealth solutions will choose instead to collaborate with us.
Table of Contents

We expect to face intensifying competition from existing competitors in our particular capabilities, platforms looking to broaden their services offerings, and new entrants that introduce digital health services and software platforms or other technology. We currently face competition from a range of point solutions, including specialized software providers that are continuing to more deeply integrate their technology with care delivery services. In addition, large, well-financed healthcare providers have in some cases developed their own telemedicine services and technologies and may provide these solutions to their patients at discounted prices.
The principal competitive factors upon which we compete include:
•consumer/provider/patient user acceptance, satisfaction, and utilization;
•continuous innovation of technologies and services, including an integrated platform that unifies the users’ experiences;
•effectively building a brand and reputation;
•building interoperable platforms that can connect with legacy enterprise and integrated care network infrastructures;
•integrating into the workflows and processes of providers, payors, and government entities;
•reducing care delivery costs across multiple stakeholders;
•enabling a suite of digital health tools from within existing customer workflows;
•depth of expertise in care delivery of varying acuity, technology, sales and service;
•scalability of our business models; and
•operational execution abilities.
We believe that we are uniquely positioned on the basis of these factors and that the offerings of competitors do not comprehensively address the needs of our key stakeholders across our key markets, or fail to do so at scale.
Competitive Advantage
We bring a set of attributes to market that we believe will continue to differentiate us across our major stakeholders and end markets. While there have been a number of recent innovations across one-off point solutions aimed at solving specific pain points, we believe they tend to lack a comprehensive approach to addressing broad challenges across the care continuum, and thus fail to fully solve healthcare disparities for all stakeholders. What is required is a combination of innovative technologies and technology-enabled services that are integrated within the workflows and core operating systems of payors, providers, and patients. We believe that the digital health platforms that thrive long term will be those that enable a hybrid model of care delivery, enhancing onsite care settings with an integrated digital infrastructure that provides virtual care access and engagement while also coordinating and connecting both community and clinical care teams within defined populations.
An Integrated Global Digital Health Platform Addressing Critical Market Needs
We will operate in the healthcare landscape across three large and high growth digital healthcare markets, providing a comprehensive care hub across multiple care settings. We aim to reshape healthcare delivery through integrated offerings that unite the healthcare ecosystem, enabling the “practice” of digital health. Together, these advancements are leading to a convergence of people, information, technology, and connectivity that improve healthcare and health outcomes through a more coordinated, data-driven, and personalized care experience. We seek to deliver on our vision of providing a guided care experience for patients and providers that is frictionless, engaging, and easy to use.
As we work to successfully integrate our platform, we believe our combined set of services and capabilities will address many needs for patients, health systems and payors currently unmet by legacy point solutions. We believe patients will value a more holistic, convenient care experience, as well as their entire care story in one place, enabling whole-person care. Health systems are presented with the entire picture of care coordination across the system, including the entire ecosystem of post-acute and socially, enabling team-based care. Payors will realize a comprehensive suite of digital services and a bridge platform between 
Table of Contents

their claims processing systems and the broader ecosystem, providing the connectivity and intelligence needed for effective management of members’ costs and outcomes.
We will simplify how providers care for patients, putting a full care continuum at their fingertips 24/7, and enabling local healthcare systems to build their integrated digital health strategy from a single point of entry like an iPad or personal phone. Our partners/customers are at different points on the spectrum of digital transformation and we meet them where they are on their transformation journey, paying particular attention to reshaping existing workflows internally and across multiple stakeholders. We believe this experience can only be provided seamlessly via integrated, coordinated care teams that rely on AI data-driven analytics and support.
Expansive Reach across Domestic and International Markets
We are a global company, doing business in several geographies. As a result, we are not overexposed to the risks associated with any one country. Our roots are strong in North America, with our international base in India allowing us to opportunistically target other high-growth areas internationally.
Domestically, we have an expansive reach across more than 2,300 health care venues spanning the U.S. Our Integrated Care Management capabilities also provide a platform with advanced analytics and data insights for health plans, health systems (such as L.A. Care and Alameda County), government agencies, and community organizations across the U.S. Meanwhile, MedQuest Pharmacy is licensed to ship to all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia and has cultivated considerable relationships with members of U.S. Congress as a leading voice for the compounded pharmaceutical industry. The overall platform has significant domestic reach across many facets of the U.S. healthcare industry.
Internationally, our global Virtual Care Infrastructure capabilities are expanding rapidly, especially in India. Glocal’s modular approach to primary care delivery in vulnerable communities in both rural and urban settings has driven strong interest from national health ministries and other organizations responsible for the care of populations which have historically been underserved. Leveraging our global footprint and technology base, we can continue to spread knowledge and insights gained in one area to our entire network, enabling more effective care in all parts of the world.
Table of Contents

Below illustrates our reach across health systems, health plans and government ministries:
A Diverse Management Team of Industry Leaders
Our management team is uniquely comprised of entrepreneurs and founders of UpHealth companies, who have dedicated their lives to solving specific healthcare issues in the world today. We believe that this diverse group of leaders is distinctively equipped to lead the movement in reshaping care delivery to the “practice” of digital health which can improve global healthcare delivery. Continuous innovation, effective operations at scale, and deep industry and technical knowledge combine to bring to life our vision of healthcare better for all.
Research and Development
Our ability to continue to differentiate and enhance our platform depends, in large part, on our capacity to continue to introduce new services, technologies, features, and functionality. Our founders, as well as our executives and various employees, have significant involvement in the development of new products. In addition, we utilize certain third-party development services to perform application development. We focus our research and development spend on developing new products and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance, and flexibility of our existing platform and products.
Facilities
Our principal executive offices, which we lease, are located at 14000 S. Military Trail, Suite 203, Delray Beach, Florida 33484. We also have centers of operation in California, Ohio, Missouri, Utah, and West Bengal, India. With the exception of certain properties in India that are owned by Glocal, we lease all of our properties. We may procure additional space as we add employees and expand geographically. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future, and that, should it be needed, suitable additional space will be available to accommodate any such expansion.
U.S. Government Regulation
Our existing and planned operations are subject to comprehensive U.S. federal, state and local and international regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers, to maintain all necessary licenses and to operate in compliance with applicable laws and rules. Those laws and regulations continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare, data privacy and security, and medical practice laws and regulations. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In some jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of formal judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that impacts our operations.
Table of Contents

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, state and federal regulatory authorities loosened or removed a number of regulatory requirements in order to increase the availability and accessibility of telehealth services. For example, many state governors issued executive orders permitting out-of-state physicians and other health care professionals to practice in their state without any additional licensure or by using a temporary, expedited, or abbreviated licensure process, so long as they hold a valid license in another state. In addition, changes were made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs (through waivers and other regulatory authority) to increase access to telehealth services by, among other things, expanding coverage for telehealth services, removing geographic restrictions and originating site requirements, permitting the waiver of patient copayment responsibilities that may hinder access, allowing reimbursement for services performed by out-of-state providers, waiving federal responsibilities that may hinder access, waiving federal restrictions on the prescribing of controlled substances via telehealth, and eliminating prior authorization requirements. It is uncertain whether these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect beyond the current public health emergency. However, there have been several developments that suggest at least some of the temporary measures may be extended, including an August 2020 executive order issued by President Trump and the Calendar Year 2021 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in December 2020. The executive order instructed the Department of Health and Human Services to review the temporary telehealth measures, particularly with respect to patients in rural areas, and propose extensions. Additionally, the executive order instructed the HHS to review recommendations made by the Taskforce on Telehealth Policy, which, among other things, recommended eliminating unnecessary restrictions on telehealth across state lines, lifting restrictions on originating sites, and allowing telehealth for various types of clinicians and conditions. The Calendar Year 2021 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule added more than 60 services to the Medicare telehealth list that will continue to be covered beyond the end of the current public health emergency (“PHE”) period.
Coverage for telehealth services by commercial payors vary, depending on the individual plan. We believe that a return to the status quo would not have a material negative impact on any commercial agreements we have entered into during 2020 or 2021. Each of these agreements has a defined term and virtually none allow for immediate termination for convenience by the customer in question. For many health care companies engaging in telehealth, the most significant potential concern about returning to the status quo is reinstatement of certain Medicare rules and restrictions that limit reimbursement for telehealth visits provided to Medicare beneficiaries, such as limitations on the types of services covered and restricting telehealth coverage and reimbursement to only certain patients in rural areas. Significantly, CMS added certain services to the permanent Medicare telehealth list to be reimbursed beyond the end of the PHE. However, permanent Medicare telehealth reimbursement beyond the PHE is limited to beneficiaries in rural areas located in a medical facility. Though COVID-19 waivers temporarily removed the rural and originating site limitations, CMS does not have statutory authority to pay for telehealth to beneficiaries outside of rural areas or to beneficiaries located in their homes (with some exceptions). Thus, for telehealth reimbursement to expand to non-rural beneficiaries beyond the PHE, legislative intervention would be needed to permanently expand telehealth reimbursement.
Telehealth Provider Licensing, Medical Practice, Certification and Related Laws and Guidelines
The practice of medicine is subject to various federal, state, and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals, and standards, relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, the practice of medicine (including the provision of remote care), equipment, personnel, mitigating potential conflicts of interests, operating policies and procedures, and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication and ordering of tests. The application of some of these laws to telehealth is unclear, evolving, and subject to differing interpretation. Many states have specific statutes and regulations addressing provision of medical care via telehealth modalities and requirements that must be met to do so. Generally, the services provided must fall within the scope of practice for the licensed professional per the particular state’s board licensing rules and regulations, the same standard of care needs to be met as required for in-person care, and physicians must obtain informed consent from patients to the care provided and the virtual setting.
Physicians who provide professional medical services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine in the state in which the patient is located. We have established systems for ensuring that our affiliated physicians are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our clients occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing state licensing requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in licensure actions against the physicians, our services being found to be non-reimbursable by payors, or prior payments being subject to recoupments and can give rise to civil, criminal or administrative penalties.
Generally, physicians providing services through telehealth must also use HIPAA-compliant technology. During the PHE, the Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) is using discretion in collecting penalties for good faith use of telehealth, even if the services are not provided through a HIPAA-compliant secure platform. Thus, HIPAA compliance as related to the telehealth platform is less of a concern during the PHE but will be required long-term. Certain types of technology, such as audio-video synchronous technology, may be required for compliance with state laws and reimbursement depending on the type of service and the payor.

Pharmacy Laws and Regulations
MedQuest Pharmacy’s pharmacy business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. Pharmacies, pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians are subject to a variety of federal and state statutes and regulations governing various aspects of the pharmacy business, including the distribution of drugs; operation of mail order pharmacies; licensure of facilities and professionals, including pharmacists, technicians and other healthcare professionals; packaging, storing, distributing, shipping and tracking of pharmaceuticals; repackaging of drug products; labeling, medication guides, and other consumer disclosures; interactions with prescribing professionals; compounding of prescription medications; counseling of patients; prescription transfers; advertisement of prescription products and pharmacy services; security; controlled substance inventory control and recordkeeping; and reporting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) , state boards of pharmacy, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and other state enforcement or regulatory agencies. Many states have laws and regulations requiring out-of-state mail-order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy. In addition, the FDA inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs. The Federal Trade Commission also has requirements for mail-order sellers of goods. The United States Postal Service (the “USPS”) has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mail-order operations. The USPS historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances. If the USPS restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail, alternative means of delivery are available to us. However, alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive. The U.S. Department of Transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted into the stream of commerce. These regulations generally do not apply to the USPS and its operations.
Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws in the U.S.; Fee Splitting
The companies that are now part of UpHealth contract with physicians or physician-owned professional associations and professional corporations to provide them and their patients with access to our platform. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws that prohibit fee splitting or the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons and that are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing a physician’s professional judgment. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. Under the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of certain states, decisions and activities that may be performed by unlicensed individuals or entities and perceived as impacting the clinical decision-making of licensed professionals such as scheduling, policy and procedure development, contracting, setting rates and the hiring and management of clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine. Similarly, certain compensation arrangements between licensed professionals and unlicensed individuals and entities can implicate state fee-splitting prohibitions, which prohibit providers from sharing a portion of their professional fees collected with third parties.
State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws and rules vary from state to state and are not always consistent across states. In addition, these requirements are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our engagement of a provider licensed in the state or the provision of telehealth to a resident of the state. Thus, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our providers, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee splitting. In such event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our affiliated providers, civil, criminal or administrative penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our providers that interfere with our business, and other materially adverse consequences.
U.S. Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
Federal Stark Law
We are subject to the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the Stark Law. Where applicable, this law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” such as laboratory and radiology services that are furnished at an entity if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a “financial relationship” (including an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such designated health services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $25,820 per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (described below). The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $172,137 for a circumvention scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In

addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of various healthcare fraud and abuse statutes, including the Stark Law, can be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act (described below) based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute is a broadly worded, intent-based federal criminal statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, provision, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs or (ii) the purchasing, leasing or ordering or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if “one purpose” of a payment is to induce referrals. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation, making it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the requisite state of mind or “scienter” required for a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, as discussed below. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $104,330 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of more than $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in the federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Imposition of any of these remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that protect certain common industry practices from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are narrowly drawn, and arrangements may be subject to scrutiny or penalty if they do not fully satisfy all elements of an available exception or safe harbor. However, the failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute.
Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources comply with current law and available interpretative guidance, as a practical matter, it is not always possible to structure our arrangements so as to fall squarely within an available safe harbor. Where that is the case, we cannot guarantee that applicable regulatory authorities will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws, including state anti-kickback laws (described below).
Federal False Claims Act
Both federal and state government agencies have continued civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies and their executives and managers. Although there are a number of civil and criminal statutes that can be applied to healthcare providers, a significant number of these investigations involve the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to a federal health care program or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Federal False Claims Act actions can be initiated not only by the government but also through civil whistleblower or qui tam lawsuits. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $11,665 to $23,331 for each false claim or statement for penalties assessed after June 19, 2020, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for exclusion from federal health care programs. There is also the federal criminal False Claims Act, which is similar to the federal civil False Claims Act and imposes criminal liability on those that make or present a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
Foreign and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
There are state and foreign law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary by jurisdiction and are enforced by local courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers or to any payor, including to funds paid out of pocket by a patient. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.

Other Healthcare Laws
HIPAA established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non-governmental payors of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from federal health care programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representations, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund a known overpayment. These provisions are intended to punish some of the same conduct in the submission of claims to private payors as the federal False Claims Act covers in connection with federal health care programs.
In addition, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to the federal health care programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in the federal health care programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $20,866 for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties associated with the wrongful act. Although this prohibition applies only to federal health care program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payors may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts, and statutory or common law fraud.
U.S. State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of PII, including health information. In particular, HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of PHI, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI in electronic form. Our health system clients, and our health plan clients are all regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. We are a business associate of our covered entity clients when we are working on behalf of our covered entity clients including our affiliated medical groups and also when we are providing technology services to those clients via our telehealth platform.
As a business associate, we are also directly regulated by HIPAA and are required to provide satisfactory written assurances to our covered entity clients through written business associate agreements that we will provide our services in accordance with HIPAA. Failure to comply with these contractual agreements could lead to loss of clients, contractual liability to our clients, and direct action by HHS, including monetary penalties. Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. The civil penalties include civil monetary penalties of up to $59,552 per violation, not to exceed approximately $1,800,000 for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year (as of 2020, and subject to periodic adjustments for inflation), and in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. Under the breach notification rule, covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which may compromise the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to HHS and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. HIPAA also requires a business associate to notify its covered entity clients of breaches by the business associate.
State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed

individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts.
HIPAA also required HHS to adopt national standards for electronic transactions that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically. On January 16, 2009, HHS released the final rule mandating that everyone covered by HIPAA must implement ICD-10 for medical coding on October 1, 2013, which was subsequently extended to October 1, 2015 and is now in effect.
Many states in which we operate and in which our patients reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but, unlike HIPAA, some may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject.
In addition to HIPAA and state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security acts or practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security and laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting. The FTC and states’ attorneys general have brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act and similar state laws. FTC jurisdiction in data privacy and security cases is concurrent with the Office of Civil Rights’ jurisdiction with respect to HIPAA.
In recent years, there have been a number of well publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of PII and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials and provide credit monitoring services and/or other relevant services to impacted individuals. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts that we enter into with our clients who are covered entities, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our clients following discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others.
International Regulation
Our international operations are subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by jurisdiction, including anti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate governance, privacy, data protection (including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation which became effective in May 2018 across the EU, which would be applicable if we expand our operations into the EU), data mining, data transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures; required localization of records and funds; and limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital. In addition, the expansion of our operations into foreign countries increases our exposure to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of U.S. law, including the FCPA, and corresponding foreign laws, including the UK Bribery Act.
The FCPA prohibits offering, promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. We also are subject to applicable anti-corruption laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and the DOJ have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The UK Bribery Act is an anti-corruption law that is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to all companies with a nexus to the United Kingdom. Disclosures of FCPA violations may be shared with the UK authorities, thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions. We have internal control policies and procedures and conduct training and compliance programs for our employees to deter prohibited practices. However, if our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing our international operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions.

We also are subject to regulation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. In addition, we may be subject to similar regulations in the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate.
The healthcare industry in India is subject to laws, rules and regulations in the regions where we conduct our business or in which we intend to expand our operations. Given our digital health centers are situated at multiple locations, we are subject to various and extensive local law, rules and regulations relating, among other things, to the setting up and operation of private medical care establishments. Health and safety laws and regulations in India are becoming increasingly stringent in the recent years, and it is possible that they will become significantly more stringent in the future. India is also in the process of and has certain legislation pending regarding increased data privacy.
Intellectual Property
We own and use trademarks and service marks on or in connection with our services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in several jurisdictions. In addition, we rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties and on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary processes and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. These licenses are standard licenses for common, easily replaceable commercial infrastructure. We require our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors to execute confidentiality, agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement while using our property or which relate to our business.
Glocal may file for patents in India in the future. We do not currently consider any of these patents used in our business to be material to our business. No other subsidiaries have any existing or planned patents. We may continue to submit patent applications for new inventions and ideas we develop as well as monitor competitors in an effort to protect our intellectual property.
From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings relating to intellectual property arising in the ordinary course of our business, including oppositions to our applications for trademarks or patents, challenges to the validity of our intellectual property rights, and claims of intellectual property infringement. We are not presently a party to any such legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, reputational harm and other factors.
Where You Can Find Additional Information
We are subject to reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current event reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. You can read our SEC filings over the Internet at our website at https://uphealthinc.com/ and the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Copies of such material can also be obtained from the Public Reference Section of the SEC, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, at prescribed rates or on the SEC’s website.
