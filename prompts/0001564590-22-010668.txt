Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 Aterian, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Aterian”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”), is a technology-enabled consumer products platform that uses “data science” (which includes but is not limited to, machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics) to design, develop, market and sell products.  Aterian was founded on the premise that if a company selling consumer packaged goods was founded today, it would apply data science, the synthesis of massive quantities of data and the use of social proof to validate high caliber product offerings as opposed to over-reliance on brand value and other traditional marketing tactics. Today, we predominantly operate through online retail channels such as Amazon.com (“Amazon”) and Walmart, Inc.
 We have launched and sold hundreds of SKUs on e-commerce platforms. Through the success of a number of those products we have incubated our own brands. We also have purchased brands and products when we believe it is advantageous.  Today, we own and operate fourteen brands which sell products in multiple categories, including home and kitchen appliances, kitchenware, heating, cooling and air quality appliances (dehumidifiers, humidifiers and air conditioners), health and beauty products and essential oils. 
 Our fourteen brands are hOmeLabs; Vremi, Squatty Potty; Xtava; RIF6; Aussie Health; Holonix; Truweo; Mueller; Pursteam; Pohl and Schmitt; Spiralizer; Healing Solutions; and Photo Paper Direct.  By leveraging our proprietary software technology platform, known as AIMEE, we are able to identify new product and market opportunities, and to launch, market and sell products in the rapidly growing global e-commerce market. AIMEE combines large quantities of data, data science and other automation algorithms, at scale, to allow rapid opportunity identification and automated online sales and marketing of consumer products.
 AIMEE sources data from various e-commerce platforms, the internet and publicly available data, allowing us to estimate and determine trends, performance and consumer sentiment on products and searches within e-commerce platforms. This functionality allows us to help determine which products to market, manufacture through contract manufacturers, import and sell on e-commerce marketplaces. AIMEE is also connected, through application program interfaces (“APIs”), to multiple e-commerce platforms. This allows us to automate the purchase of marketing, automate various parts of our fulfillment and logistics operations and to automate pricing changes on product listings. We generate revenue primarily through the online sales of our various digital native consumer products and a substantial percentage of our sales are made through the Amazon U.S. marketplace.
 See the sections contained within this Annual Report entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” for further information.

Our Platform 
 
AIMEE, our proprietary technology, is a cloud-based modular platform incorporating a multi-tenant architecture. Our platform is highly configurable and designed to provide flexibility in implementing critical business processes. AIMEE connects to multiple e-commerce platforms and other internet based sources through application program interfaces (“APIs”) in order to ingest data. 
 At its core, AIMEE ingests data used in product research, analysis and performance and provides the automation of numerous sales, marketing and fulfillment tasks and functions. AIMEE helps us automate and manage the life-cycle of our consumer product portfolio and provides us with the ability to scale our business efficiently.  AIMEE, along with our people, allows us to perform the following key business functions:
 
3



 
1) | identify specific product and market opportunities;
---+----------------------------------------------------


2) | execute and manage certain online marketing strategies;
---+--------------------------------------------------------


3) | automate portions of the fulfillment processes;
---+------------------------------------------------


4) | receive inventory visibility; and
---+----------------------------------


5) | receive individual product operational and financial performance.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------

 AIMEE is comprised of three modules that are in various stages of development and that operate today in combination with human judgment and oversight:
 
 
1. | Market Research module: AIMEE ingests, analyzes and filters millions of shopping-related data points (e.g., product rankings, average review score and number of reviews). We use this module to research and analyze data, along with outside data points (e.g., manufacturer and supply chain information) to determine what product and market opportunities may exist for us to pursue. Some of the core functions under this module are: 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Idea Generator - allows users to conduct research based on various marketplace data points and consumer path to purchase in order to help determine what product opportunities may exist.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Keyword Research - allows users to research and understand search trends, seasonality and the most frequently searched words and/or phrases being searched on marketplaces.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product Search - allows users to research and understand, through actual data and estimates, how competing products are performing on marketplaces.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Marketing and Fulfillment module: AIMEE provides operational efficiency and certain automation of various portions of our marketing and fulfillment tasks. We use this module to efficiently scale our business and product portfolio. Some of the core functions under this module are: 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Marketing engine - allows users to run processes and tasks, including certain automated functions, as part of the management of our product sales and contribution margin performance on marketplaces. These tasks can include but are not limited to assisting in evaluating price, media buying, product listing health, search engine optimization and inventory levels. AIMEE’s architecture continues to be developed to implement new skills and to execute tactics and strategies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fulfillment engine - allows our operations team to automate various logistical tasks, allowing us to ingest and continually confirm orders between us, various marketplaces and our warehouse partners. This allows our fulfillment and logistics operations to ensure our consumer products are being fulfilled and picked up for timely delivery. This module also provides us with data on our inventory across our various warehouse locations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Financial Planning & Analysis module: AIMEE provides product-level financial information on various timely intervals. This module allows our users to create forecasts with data from within AIMEE and from other outside data points to provide estimated product performance projections which can be compared to actual results. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As part of using AIMEE consistently, we oversee and improve the data and automation driven by our AIMEE platform. Here are some examples for each module of how our team validates the accuracy of the information we use in part in making our business decisions:
  
1) | Market Research Module.To verify our market research module’s ability to measure competitor product performance and other metrics, we frequently look at its ability to do so on our own products using only publicly available data. Since we also have accurate inside data for the products we sell, we can verify how close the research module’s estimates of sales are based on limited information.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Market Automation and Fulfillment Modules.To verify the accuracy of the decisions we make based on our marketing automation and fulfillment modules, we consistently track the daily performance of each product. Tracking daily performance includes the improvement or deterioration of the product’s sales, including but not limited to, marketing programs being executed, and fulfillment costs over time as well as the on-time performance metrics of last mile shipping.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Financial Planning & Analysis Modules.To verify the accuracy of the decisions we make in conjunction with our Financial Planning & Analysis modules, we consistently spot check the reporting accuracy manually as well as cross-reference the sales results in our dashboards against the reports received from our sales channels, such as Amazon, Walmart, etc.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We continue to develop AIMEE’s capabilities. This includes forecasting, inventory management, online marketing and other aspects, which require human judgment and oversight. At its core, AIMEE is designed to intelligently automate many of our business tasks and provides us with the ability to scale our business.
 For the year-ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we spent approximately $9.8 million and $8.2 million, respectively, on research and development expenses, of which the majority are related to AIMEE. Included in the year-ended December 31, 2021 
 4


and December 31, 2020 research and development expenses were approximately $5.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expenses, primarily for executives and senior management.  We continue to expect to spend more than $4.0 million annually in research and development expenses, exclusive of stock-based compensation charges.
 Our Business Model 
 We believe the digital disruption of retail, namely the consumer shift to e-commerce, will continue for decades to come. As this digital disruption continues, we believe the products consumers purchase, and the places they purchase them, will index more towards function, value, and ease / speed of delivery and less towards the historical dominance of brand recognition.  The ubiquity of data on the internet has empowered consumers to make data driven choices when it comes to nearly every consumer choice.  In this data rich world, we believe that digital marketplaces offer both brands and consumers the best value when it comes to buying and selling consumer products.
 For the consumer, digital marketplaces offer nearly endless product choice, competitive pricing and easy delivery options.  For brands and manufacturers, digital marketplaces not only offer the ability to instantly connect with millions of customers across the world, but also provide a real-time data stream of purchase behavior to decide against.  The data that digital marketplaces provide, in addition to consumer trends data that exists outside of these marketplaces, creates an opportunity for software to change the way products are ideated, merchandised, marketed, analyzed and fulfilled.
 AIMEE, our software platform, infuses technology throughout the consumer product value chain, generally allowing us to create and sell products and brands with a more customer centric value proposition than the legacy incumbents’ products. 
 We believe our platform makes it possible for us to launch and automates the sales of evergreen products with features that customers have indicated are the most important to them and with profitable unit economics. With scale, we gain purchasing power both at the product level and at the overall fulfillment level, which improves our operating results. We also believe that our platform provides us with substantial leverage such that we can acquire already existing products and utilize AIMEE to optimize “make” versus “buy” decisions. Our technology also gives us the ability to track unit economics on an individual SKU basis, which we believe, combined with the automation of our fixed costs, will allow us to disrupt and scale the consumer product business model.

Our technology also gives us the ability to track unit economics on an individual SKU basis, which we believe, combined with the automation of our fixed costs, will allow us to disrupt and scale the consumer product business model. 
 Our product lifecycle can be summarized as follows: 
  
1. | We use AIMEE to analyze shopping-related data points, assist in performing product cash flow projections at the product level and to assist in determining product opportunities in e-commerce markets on which we sell, primarily the US Amazon marketplace.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | We contract manufacture products under our owned and operated brands based on the data analyzed by AIMEE and other sources and aim to commercially launch such products roughly within six to eight months after an idea has been identified.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3.    Each of our products typically goes through the Launch phase and depending on its level of success is moved to one of the other phases as further described below: 
 i.
Launch phase: During this phase, we leverage our technology to target marketing opportunities identified using AIMEE (Artificial Intelligence Marketplace e-Commerce Engine) and other sources. During this period of time, due to the combination of discounts and investment in marketing, our net margin for a product could be as low as approximately negative 35%. Net margin is calculated by taking net revenue less the cost of goods sold, less fulfillment, online advertising and selling expenses. These costs primarily reflect the estimated variable costs related to the sale of a product.
 ii.Sustain phase: Our goal is for every product we launch to enter the sustain phase and become profitable, with a target of positive 15% net margin for most products, within approximately three months of launch on average. Over time, our products benefit from economies of scale stemming from purchasing power both with manufacturers and with fulfillment providers.
 iii.Milk phase or Liquidate phase: If a product does not enter the sustain phase or if the customer satisfaction of the product (i.e., ratings) is not satisfactory, then it will go to the liquidate phase and we will sell through the remaining 
 5


inventory. In order to enter the milk phase, a product must be well received and become a strong leader in its category in both customer satisfaction and volume sold as compared to its competition. Products in the milk phase that have achieved profitability should benefit from pricing power and we expect their profitability to increase accordingly. To date, none of our products have achieved the milk phase and we can provide no assurance that any of our products will do so in the future.
 To date, our operating results have included a mix of products in the launch, sustain and liquidate phases, and we expect such results to include a mix of products in all phases at any given period. Product mix can affect our gross profit and the variable portion of our sales and distribution expenses. Ultimately, we believe that the future cash flow generated by our products in the sustain phase will outpace the amount that we will reinvest into launching new products, driving net revenue and profitability at the company level while we continue to invest in growth and technology.
 Consumer Products - Make versus Buy
 We have used AIMEE to internally develop our product portfolio for our owned and operated consumer product brands and have hundreds of SKUs available for sale. AIMEE’s idea generator has been developed to be product agnostic and we believe can generate product opportunities in most product categories. We have also leveraged AIMEE to assist in decision-making and diligence to buy (acquire through acquisition) consumer product brands and related products. During 2021, we acquired the brands Healing Solutions, Squatty Potty and Photo Paper Direct; during 2020, we acquired the brands Truweo, Mueller, Pursteam, Pohl and Schmitt, and Spriralizer and their related products; during 2019, we acquired the brand Aussie Health.
Acquisitions 
 While we intend to pursue growth from our existing product portfolio and from new product launches, we also intend to pursue growth through strategic acquisitions of digital native brands that we believe will integrate well with our business. When looking at new potential product categories and potential acquisition targets, we typically apply a make-or-buy analysis based in part on the data provided from our AIMEE technology platform and other sources of data combined with our assessment of the risks and costs of successfully launching products in the new product category. We intend to pursue acquisitions when the target meets our financial and other criteria, including revenue and profit sustainability. We expect that these consumer product businesses will typically have built a significant presence on at least one e-commerce marketplace around one or more product categories. We expect that the products of these businesses will have strong unit economics, high product quality and stable supply chains, have developed significant social proof in the form of customer reviews and high search ranking for relevant keywords and are in product categories where frequent product improvement is not required. They also tend to have significant concentration risk due to limited product offerings, have limited ability to scale as they do not have a technology platform enabling automation and have limited working capital to further enable growth.
 Our ability to complete any acquisition typically depends on a number of factors such as the successful completion of confirmatory due diligence, negotiation of definitive agreements, the seller providing seller financing, our ability to use debt and equity financing, and permission from our existing lenders. 
 Platform as a Service (Managed PaaS)
 While our core focus is currently on our organic consumer product and acquired business, we believe that as we scale and unlock more resources to invest in it, our Managed PAAS offering could in the long term become a substantial part of our business. We believe that this solution, which includes combined access to our team’s expertise and portions of the AIMEE platform, could provide an advantage over other competitors in this industry. We believe this is because many incumbent companies have historically operated as business-to-businesses and have not invested sufficiently to succeed on online marketplaces. With our Managed PaaS solution, we believe we can bridge this operational gap by offering our technology combined with our substantial know-how in managing business-to-consumer supply chains, marketing, and customer service, among other things.
 We currently structure our offering as a standalone service or, in cases where the client’s third-party’s logistics do not allow for fulfillment direct-to-consumer, as a service suite which includes a standard reseller agreement that leverages our integrated direct-to-consumer fulfillment program. Managed PaaS is currently a nominal part of our business and will remain so while we are focusing our resources on scaling our consumer business. We believe that in the short to medium term the consumer business opportunity is larger.

Intellectual Property 
 We rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements (including open source software) to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and internationally. We generally do not pursue patent applications as a means of protecting our intellectual property. We have applied to register or have registered certain of our trademarks in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and we will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe they would be beneficial and cost-effective. 
Customers 
 Our customers are mainly individual online consumers who purchase our products primarily on Amazon US, and to a lesser extent on our owned and operated websites and other marketplaces. In 2021, approximately 93% of our revenue was through the Amazon sales platform and in 2020, 88% of our revenue was through the Amazon sales platform.
Seasonality 
 Our individual product categories are typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of the summer season for certain of our environmental appliance products and the fall and holiday season for our small kitchen appliances and accessories. With our current mix of heating, cooling and air quality, the sales of those products tend to be significantly higher in the summer season. Further, our small kitchen appliances and accessories tend to have higher sales during the fourth quarter, which includes Thanksgiving and the December holiday season. As a result, our operational results, cash flows, cash and inventory positions may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on, among other things, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays and changes in our product mix.
Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing strategy and approach is driven by our people, who substantially leverage AIMEE. AIMEE is being developed to allow price automatization, media buying and search engine optimization leveraging our proprietary technology software and algorithms we have built into AIMEE. We believe this automation will bring significant competitive advantages for our products and PaaS customers alike. For our SKUs, our advertising investment is focused on online channels and e-commerce platforms. Currently our primary focus on advertising spend is online across Amazon, Google and Facebook. Our spend and approach on advertising is different depending on the life cycle of products on our platform. We view and classify products into categories such as launch, sustain, milk or liquidate.  
 The launch phase is where we classify new products being introduced into the marketplace. The advertising spend during this stage is aggressive and can last for a number of months on average to ensure the product launch is successful, with a focus on search optimization and the development of social proof that our products are meeting customer needs. Once our products reach the sustain phase, our sales and marketing strategy then focuses primarily on managing price and pay-per-click optimization, along with a corresponding reduction in spending on search optimization and social proof. 
 Third-Party Manufacturing & Logistics 
 As of December 31, 2021, we contract, through purchase orders, with approximately 148 manufacturers, predominately in China, for a substantial percentage of our consumer products. As of December 31, 2021, we have an operations team of approximately 26 people in Shenzhen, China, 10 people in our Philippines office, and 14 people across the U.S. that perform sourcing, product testing, manufacturer qualification, quality assurance and control and purchasing, among other things. In general, we do not use master agreements with vendors and aim to have flexibility in our supply chain to match our forecasting needs.
 We use a combination of Amazon warehouses, other third-party warehouse and logistics partners to fulfill direct-to-consumer orders, through agreements or terms of services. In addition to fulfillment by Amazon warehouses, in 2018 we began utilizing three geographically distributed third-party warehouses to allow us to deliver orders within two days through ground shipment to approximately 99% of the U.S. market. Warehouse selection for any particular product depends on the size and other aspects of the products to be warehoused, with a focus on optimizing storage and fulfillment costs. We are focused on driving manufacturing and logistics costs down as we grow, scale and improve our purchasing power. We have expanded our third-party warehouse network to provide fulfillment by merchant One Day Prime delivery. This expansion covered approximately 76% of the U.S. market in 2021, based on our sales history. We believe that the increase in warehouse costs associated with this expansion will be more than offset by the decrease in shipping costs to customers as the average last mile shipping zones will decrease due to our increased reach.

Competition 
 The consumer goods and e-commerce markets are highly competitive, including the market for potential merger and acquisition opportunities where there are many aggregators with substantial access to capital focused on acquiring Amazon third party sellers. Our competitors include traditional and non-traditional consumer good companies, discount stores, traditional retailers, the online platforms of these traditional retail competitors, independent retail stores and e-commerce companies. The market for PaaS services relating to e-commerce, and the U.S. Amazon marketplace in particular, is also very competitive with a variety of well-funded entrants in the space.  The market landscape is diverse, with competitors selling into brands, agencies, manufacturers and retailers alike. The services offered by these competitors vary, with some offering point solutions for specific aspects related to selling on Amazon, including research and business intelligence, Amazon services and listing management, while others focus on a more holistic approach.  Some of these competitors leverage proprietary software to execute their services, while others offer personnel with relevant expertise. In addition, Amazon also offers its sellers a variety of tools that are generally free. 
 We believe that our owned and operated products business gives us an advantage as we are able to quickly develop new algorithms and test them on our own products to ensure their efficacy before delivering them to Managed PaaS clients. By having our owned and operated businesses, we are able to better predict and develop features that we believe will deliver results for Managed PaaS clients.
 With regard to our consumer product business, we believe our competitors are Amazon, Helen of Troy, Newell Brands, Frigidaire, Trademark Global and any other consumer product company that sells products similar to ours in the e-commerce space. There has also been an increase in the number of sellers who are based in China that sell products similar to ours. For our acquisition growth strategy, we believe our competitors are Thrasio, HeyDay, SellerX, Perch, Boosted Commerce and Heroes, among numerous other aggregators in the U.S. and Europe. For our Managed PaaS business, we believe our competitors are Feedvisor, CommerceIQ, Channel Advisor, Teikametrics, Jungle Scout, Helium10 and numerous others. We believe that we are able to compete effectively because of our expertise, platform, data science and other automation.
 Regulatory Matters/Governmental Regulations 
 We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local laws and international laws, including but not limited to those governing the processing of payments, consumer protection, the privacy of consumer information and other laws regarding unfair and deceptive trade practices. We are also subject to various environmental laws, rules and regulations, such as California’s Proposition 65.
 The products sold by us are also subject to regulation by U.S. governmental agencies, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, United States Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Energy and similar state and international regulatory authorities, such as the California Energy Commission. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current fiscal year or in the near future.
 We are also subject to regulations relating to our supply chain. For example, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act requires retail sellers that do business in California to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. As part of our vendor qualification process, we review suppliers’ operations for compliance with applicable labor and workplace standards and other applicable laws, including laws prohibiting child labor, forced labor and unsafe working conditions. 
 Substantially most of our products are currently manufactured in China, which may result in additional costs, if laws related to international trade result in additional tariffs on our products.
 Although we have not suffered any material restrictions from doing business in the past due to government regulations, significant impediments may arise in the future as we expand product offerings. 
 From time to time, we dispose or donate of obsolete inventory, which is disposed of or destroyed in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 People 
 The human capital objectives we focus on in managing our business include attracting, developing, and retaining key personnel. Our employees are critical to the success of our organization and we are committed to supporting our employees’ professional development. We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively implement our growth strategy and continue to drive stockholder value. We provide competitive compensation, which includes a focus on stock-based compensation, and benefits to attract and retain key personnel, while also providing a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace. As of December 31, 2021, we had 159 employees, of which 156 were full-time, and 60 independent contractors. Of our employees and contractors, 37 are 
 8


engaged in research and development, 156 are engaged in sales, marketing and operations and 26 are in general corporate and administrative positions. 
 As of December 31, 2021, our employees and contractors are based in seven offices (including shared workspaces) and remote work locations. Of our employees and contractors, 26 are in research and development, sales, marketing, operations, general corporate and administration in New York, 25 are in operations and revenue across remote roles in the U.S., 32 are in China where we perform operations and manufacturer inspections, one is in the U.K. in finance, 79 are in the Philippines where we perform customer service, sales and marketing and other logistics functions and 26 are in Poland where we perform research and development. We also contract with 21 consultants, predominantly for research and development functions in Ukraine, Poland, Israel and Montreal.
