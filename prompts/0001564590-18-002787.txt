Products, Market and Competition 
 Products
 Saving more lives on the road is a key health priority as our world grows and develops, but a population increasingly living in growth markets and megacities creates new complexities. To meet this challenge, we develop safety solutions products that work in real life situations. This is what Autoliv does.
 Our organizational structure and management reporting support the management of the following core product lines:
 3
 





Passive Safety
 Passive safety systems such a seatbelts and airbags substantially mitigate human consequences of traffic accidents.
 
The airbag module is designed to inflate extremely rapidly then quickly deflate during a collision or impact. It consists of the container, airbag cushion and an inflator. The purpose of the airbag is to provide the occupants a cushioning and restraint during a crash event to prevent any impact or impact-caused injuries between the occupant and the interior of the vehicle. 
 
Seatbelts can reduce the overall risk of serious injuries in frontal crashes by as much as 60% thanks to advanced seatbelt technologies such as pretensioners and load limiters.
 Electronics
 This segment offers a wide range of electronic safety hardware and software in the areas of safety and drive assist.
 Restraint Control systems enable appropriate deployment of the airbags and seatbelt pretensioners. Autoliv’s latest Electronic Control Unit (ECU) also contains sensors for Electronic Stability Control System. Satellite sensors are mounted in various locations around the vehicle, to quickly provide the system with acceleration data. 

 We provide advanced active safety sensors used for both Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (“ADAS”) and Autonomous Driving (“AD”) solutions, such as vision and radar systems, advanced ADAS controllers, night vision and positioning systems. Through Zenuity, our joint venture with Volvo Cars, we develop advanced software systems for vehicle decision control for ADAS and AD. In addition, we offer driver monitoring systems, LiDAR sensors and other technologies critical for ADAS and AD solutions by leveraging our partnership network.
 Autoliv-Nissin Brake Systems (ANBS) is a 51% owned joint venture we established with Nissin Kogyo in 2016 for Brake Actuation and Brake Control, and is consolidated by Electronics. ANBS provides products for both traditional and new braking systems, which we see as building blocks, in the actuation area towards highly automated driving.
 Through Zenuity, our joint venture with Volvo Cars, we develop advanced software systems for vehicle decision control for ADAS and AD.
 
Market and Competition
 Consumer research clearly shows that people want safe cars, and several significant trends are likely to have a positive influence on overall safety content per vehicle (CPV). These include:
 1) Society becoming increasingly focused on Vision Zero, which includes reducing traffic fatalities and associated costs,
 2) Demographic trends of increased urbanization, aging driver populations and increased safety focus in the Growth Markets,
 3) Evolving government regulations and test rating systems to improve the safety of vehicles in various markets, such as the new Euro NCAP, and
 4) Ongoing evolution of collision avoidance technologies and an industry focused on achieving advanced driver assistance (ADAS), highly automated driving (HAD) and, ultimately, some form of autonomous driving (AD).
 The automotive safety market is driven by two primary factors: light vehicle production (LVP) and content per vehicle (CPV).
 The first growth driver, LVP, has increased at an average annual growth rate of around 2.8% over the last two decades despite the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. LVP is expected to grow to more than 98 million in 2020 from approximately 92 million in 2017, according to IHS. Almost all of this expansion will be in the Growth Markets, predominantly in China, India, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe.
 Unlike LVP, where Autoliv can only aim to be on the best-selling platforms, Autoliv can influence CPV more directly by continuously developing and introducing new technologies with higher value-added features. Over the long term, this increases average safety CPV and has caused our markets to grow faster than the LVP. 
 
Passive Safety
 Since the start of Autoliv, Inc. in 1997, the Company’s sales compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for passive safety has been 5.6% compared to the market rate of around 3.2% which includes an LVP of around 2.8%. Our outperformance is a result of a steady flow of new passive safety technologies, strong focus on quality and a superior global footprint both in products and engineering. This has enabled Autoliv to increase its market share from 27% in 1997 to 38% in 2017.
 4
 





In Western Europe, North America, Japan and South Korea the CPV remains around $270. CPV growth in these regions will mainly come from new passive safety systems such as active seatbelts, knee airbags, far-side impact airbags along with improved protection for pedestrians and rear-seat occupants like bag-in-belt. 
 In our Growth Markets we see great opportunities for CPV growth from more airbags and advanced seatbelt products. Average CPV in our Growth Markets is around $170, approximately $100 less than in the Developed Markets. 
 Despite a negative LVP mix effect from higher growth in low CPV markets, the passive safety market (seatbelts and airbags including steering wheels), is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.5% until 2020 to about $24 billion, based on the current macro-economic outlook and our internal market intelligence and estimates. The highest growth rate is expected in steering wheels, where Autoliv has global market share of more than 30%, generated by the trend toward higher-value steering wheels with leather and additional features.
 The Growth Markets are expected to outgrow the Developed Markets by a factor of two for the period between 2017 and 2020, as the Growth Markets are supported by a higher LVP and increasing CPV resulting from higher penetration of airbags and more advanced seatbelt products.
 In seatbelts, Autoliv has reached a global market share of around 40%, primarily due to being the technology leader with several important innovations such as pretensioners and active seatbelts. Our strong market position is also a reflection of our superior global footprint. Seatbelts are the primary life-saving safety product and are also an important requirement in low-end vehicles for the Growth Markets. This provides us with an excellent opportunity to benefit from the expected growth in this segment of the market.
 The market for airbags, where Autoliv has a market share of around 40%, is expected to grow slightly slower than the total passive safety market. This is related to the dilutive effect from new low-end vehicles in the Growth Markets, with relatively low installation rates for airbags.
 
Our competitors
 In passive safety, Autoliv’s major competitors have been Takata and ZF, where we estimate that they account for roughly one fifth and one sixth of the market respectively, while Autoliv leads the market with a share of around 38%.
 During 2017 Takata, a family-controlled Japanese company whose shares were listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S, and Japan. The bankruptcy came after accumulation of recall costs and liabilities related to malfunctioning airbag inflators. U.S.-based Key Safety Systems (KSS), owned by Chinese company Joyson, subsequently announced its intension to aquire Takata’s assets. The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approvals. Combined, Takata and KSS is estimated to hold a global market share of 26%. 
 ZF is a global leader in driveline and chassis technology, as well as in passive safety technologies and is the second largest global automotive supplier and has an estimated global market share of 16%.
 In Japan, Brazil, South Korea and China there are a number of local suppliers that have close ties with the domestic vehicle manufacturers. For example, Toyota uses “keiretsu” (in-house) suppliers Tokai Rika for seatbelts and Toyoda Gosei for airbags and steering wheels. These suppliers generally receive most of the Toyota business in Japan, in the same way, Mobis, a major supplier to Hyundai/Kia in South Korea generally receives around half of their business.
 Other passive safety system competitors include Nihon Plast and Ashimori of Japan, Jinheng of China, Samsong in South Korea and Chris in South America. Collectively, these competitors account for the majority of the remaining 20% global market share in passive safety.
 
Electronics

 Our total addressable market, including brake control systems, active safety and passive safety electronics grew by 4% in 2017, to around $20 billion. This can be compared to the more than 2% increase in global LVP. The majority of the growth came from the active safety market as our customers are seeking to manufacture vehicles that meet and exceed increasingly stringent safety test ratings around the world and to satisfy consumer demands for increased safety through more advanced driver assist features and enhanced comfort and convenience towards autonomous driving.
 The total addressable market for Electronics (active safety, restraint controls systems and brake control systems) is expected to grow by a CAGR of around 11% between 2017 and 2020, with the highest growth rate for active safety products. 
 Active Safety (LiDAR, radar, night vision, front-view mono and stereo vision cameras and ADAS ECU’s) is one of the fastest growing areas of vehicle equipment and is expected to grow at an annual rate of around 30% between 2017 and 2020. Through acquisitions, technology partnerships with customers, and licensing agreements, Autoliv continuously adds key building blocks for ADAS and AD and has developed a leading market position with a market share of 15-20%.
 In the more stable and mature restraint controls market (electronic control units and related crash sensors) Autoliv holds a leading market share position of around 25% share. This market is expected to remain relatively flat between 2017 to 2020.

Autoliv entered the brake control market with a new product offering, the Safety Domain Controller during 2014. Through the JV (ANBS) we formed with Nissin Kogyo in 2016, we expanded our product offering to brake control and brake apply systems, which we see as building blocks, in the actuator area, towards highly automated driving. We estimate the total brake control market amounted to almost $12 billion in 2017, with a projected CAGR of 4% through to 2020. We estimate our current market share to be around 4%.
 During 2017, Autoliv and Volvo Cars formed a software joint venture named Zenuity. Zenuity is active in the growing global market for autonomous driving software systems. It marks the first time a premium car maker has joined forces with a tier one supplier to develop leading software solutions for advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) technologies.
 
Our competitors
 The active safety market remains relatively fragmented with more and larger competitors, than in the passive safety market. Key competitors include Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, Denso, Magna, Valeo and ZF. 
 The current leader in camera based mono vision algorithms, Mobileye was acquired during 2017 by the computer chip maker Intel. Intel is both a supplier to and competitor of Autoliv. In addition, new potential industry entrants like Nvidia, Qualcom, Baidu, Apple, Uber and Google are testing solutions to enter the field of autonomous driving.
 Continental and Bosch are the largest competitors in restraint control systems.
 In brake control market our main competitors include ADVICS, Bosch, Continental, Mando, and ZF.
 Additional information concerning products, markets and competition is included in the “Risks and Risk Management” section under Item 7 of this Annual Report.
 
Manufacturing and Production
 Including joint venture operations, Autoliv has approximately 78 production facilities located in 25 countries, consisting of both component factories and assembly factories. See “Item 2. Properties” for a description of Autoliv’s principal properties. The component factories manufacture inflators, propellant, initiators, textile cushions, webbing, electronics, pressed steel parts, springs and overmoulded steel parts used in seatbelt and airbag assembly, steering wheels and our safety electronic systems. The assembly factories source components from a number of parties, including Autoliv’s own component factories, and assemble complete restraint systems for “just-in-time” delivery to customers. The products manufactured by Autoliv’s consolidated subsidiaries in 2017 consisted of approximately 152 million complete seatbelt systems (of which approximately 78 million were fitted with pretensioners), approximately 99 million side airbags (including curtain airbags), approximately 53 million frontal airbags, approximately 18 million steering wheels, approximately 19 million restraint control units, approximately 2 million brake control units and approximately 10 million active safety units.
 
Autoliv’s “just-in-time” delivery systems have been designed to accommodate the specific requirements of each customer for low levels of inventory and rapid stock delivery service. “Just-in-time” deliveries require final assembly or, at least, distribution centers in geographic areas close to customers to facilitate rapid delivery. The fact that the major automobile manufacturers are continually expanding their production activities into more countries and require the same or similar safety systems as those produced in Europe, Japan or the U.S. increases the importance for suppliers to have assembly capacity in several countries. Consolidation among our customers also supports this trend.
 
Autoliv’s assembly operations generally are not constrained by capacity considerations unless there is a disruption in the supply of raw materials and components. When dramatic shifts in LVP occur, Autoliv can generally adjust capacity in response to any changes in demand within a few days by adding or removing work shifts and within a few months by adding or removing standardized production and assembly lines. Most of Autoliv’s assembly factories can make sufficient space available to accommodate additional production lines to satisfy foreseeable increases in capacity. As a result, Autoliv can usually adjust its manufacturing capacity faster than its customers can adjust their capacity as a result of fluctuations in the general demand for vehicles or in the demand for a specific vehicle model, provided that customers promptly notify Autoliv when they become aware of such changes in demand.
 
When dramatic shifts in LVP occur or when there is a shift in regional LVP, the capacity adjustments can take more time and be more costly. Additionally, when there is a significant demand for a given product due to a major recall of a competitor’s product, like certain of our customers have experienced, capacity adjustments may take time.
 
We could experience disruption in our supply or delivery chain, which could cause one or more of our customers to halt or delay production. For more information, see Item 1A – “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.

Quality Management
 Autoliv believes that superior quality is a prerequisite to being considered a leading global supplier of automotive safety systems and is key to our financial performance, because quality excellence is critical for winning new orders, preventing recalls and maintaining low scrap rates. Autoliv has for many years emphasized a “zero-defect” proactive quality policy and continues to strive to improve its working methods. This means both that Autoliv’s products are expected to always meet performance expectations, and that Autoliv’s products are expected to be delivered to its customers at the right times and in the right amounts. Furthermore, we believe our continued quality improvements further enhance our reputation among our customers, employees and governmental authorities.
 
Although quality has always been paramount in the automotive industry, especially for safety products, automobile manufacturers have become increasingly focused on quality with even less tolerance for any deviations. This intensified focus on quality is partially due to an increase in the number of vehicle recalls for a variety of reasons (not just safety), including a few high-profile vehicle recalls. This trend is likely to continue as automobile manufacturers introduce even stricter quality requirements and regulating agencies and other authorities increase the level of scrutiny given to vehicle safety issues. We have not been immune to the recalls that have been impacting the automotive industry.
 
We continue to drive our quality initiative called “Q5” which was initiated in the summer of 2010. It is an integral part of our strategy of shaping a proactive quality culture of zero defects. It is called “Q5” because it addresses quality in five dimensions: products, customers, growth, behavior and suppliers. The goal of Q5 is to firmly tie together quality with value within all of our processes and for all of our employees, thereby leading to the best value for our customers. Since 2010, we have continually expanded this quality initiative to provide additional skills training to more employees and suppliers. These activities have made a significant contribution to the reduction in occurrences of non-conforming events.
 
In our pursuit of excellence in quality, we have developed a chain of four “defense lines” against potential quality issues. These defense lines consist of: 1) robust product designs, 2) flawless components from suppliers and our own in-house component companies, 3) manufacturing flawless products with a system for verifying that our products conform with specifications and 4) an advanced traceability system in the event of a recall.
 
Our pursuit of excellence extends from the earliest phases of product development to the proper disposal of a product following many years of use in a vehicle. Autoliv’s comprehensive Autoliv Product Development System includes several key check points during the process of developing new products that are designed to ensure that such products are well-built and have no hidden defects. Through this process, we work closely with our suppliers and customers to set clear standards that help to ensure robust component design and lowest cost for function in order to proactively prevent problems and ensure we deliver only the best designs to the market.
 
The Autoliv Production System (“APS”), based on the goals of improving quality and efficiency, is at the core of Autoliv’s manufacturing philosophy. APS integrates essential quality elements, such as mistake proofing, statistical process control and operator involvement, into the manufacturing processes so all Autoliv associates are aware of and understand the critical connection between themselves and our lifesaving products. This “zero-defect” principle extends beyond Autoliv to the entire supplier base. All of our suppliers must accept the strict quality standards in the global Autoliv Supplier Manual, which defines our quality requirements and focuses on preventing bad parts from being produced by our suppliers and helps eliminate defective intermediate products in our assembly lines as early as possible. In addition, Autoliv’s One Product One Process (“1P1P”) initiative is our strategy for developing and managing standardization of both core products and customer-specific features, leading not only to improved quality, but also greater cost efficiency and more efficient supply chain management.
 
Autoliv continues to execute its plan to have all of its facilities shipping to OEMs certified according to the current most rigorous global automotive quality requirements - IATF 16949:2016.
 
Environmental and Safety Regulations
 For information on how environmental and safety regulations impact our business, see “Risk Factors – ‘Our business may be adversely affected by laws or regulations, including environmental, occupational health and safety or other governmental regulations’ and ‘Our business may be adversely affected by changes in automotive safety regulations or concerns that drive further regulation of the automobile safety market’” in Item 1A and “Risks and Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Annual Report.
Raw Materials
 Approximately 54% of our revenues are spent on direct materials from external suppliers. Autoliv mainly purchases manufactured components, and approximately 50% of the component costs are comprised of raw materials. We take several actions to mitigate higher commodity prices, such as re-design of products to reduce material content and weight, components standardization to reduce complexity and gain cost advantages.
 For information on the sources and availability of raw materials, see “Risk Factors – Changes in the source, cost, availability of and regulations pertaining to raw materials and components may adversely affect our profit margins” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.

Intellectual Property
 We have developed a considerable amount of proprietary technology related to automotive safety systems and rely on many patents to protect such technology. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve. For information on our use of intellectual property and its importance to us, see “Risk Factors – If our patents are declared invalid or our technology infringes on the proprietary rights of others, our ability to compete may be impaired” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Seasonality and Backlog
 Autoliv’s business is not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. Autoliv has frame contracts with automobile manufacturers and such contracts are typically entered into up to three years before the start of production of the relevant car model or platform and provide for a term covering the life of such car model or platform including service parts after a vehicle model is no longer produced. However, typically these contracts do not provide minimum quantities, firm prices or exclusivity but instead permit the automobile manufacturer to resource the relevant products at given intervals (or at any time) from other suppliers.
Dependence on Customers
 In 2017 our top five customers represented 51% of sales and the ten largest represented 81%. This reflects the concentration in the automotive industry. The five largest vehicle manufacturers (OEMs) in 2017 accounted for 49% of global light vehicle production (LVP) and the ten largest for 74%. A delivery contract is typically for the lifetime of a vehicle model, which is normally between 4 and 6 years depending on customer platform sourcing preferences and strategies.

CUSTOMER SALES TRENDS
 Asian vehicle producers have steadily become increasingly more important to Autoliv, and now represent around 45% of global sales compared to 35% five years ago. Of the Asian OEMs, the Japanese OEMs represent 30% of our sales compared to 23% in 2012. This reflects their increasing share of the global LVP and our stronger market position based on our local presence in Japan. European OEMs have remained relatively constant at 33% in 2017 versus 34% in 2012. The Detroit-3 now account for 21% of our global sales, down from 28% in 2012 this is in part due to the lingering effects of new business hold back in 2011 and 2012. 
 For information on our dependence on customers, see “Risk Factors – Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we lost any of our largest customers or if they were unable to pay their invoices” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and Dependence on Customers under the section Risks and Risk Management in Item 7 of this Annual Report and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Research, Development and Engineering
 No single customer project accounts for more than 2% of Autoliv’s total R,D&E spending during 2017. To fuel Autoliv’s product portfolio, additional expertise is brought in-house via technology partnerships, licensing agreements as well as mergers and acquisitions.
 In addition to having our own researchers, Autoliv provides funding for a number of scientists at universities and independent research institutes to work on special projects, such as researchers in the Advanced Vehicle Technologies Consortium led by MIT.
 Expenses incurred for research, development and engineering activities, net were $741 million, $651 million and $524 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Information on research, development and engineering is included under section “Risks and Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Annual Report.

Regulatory Costs
 The fitting of seatbelts in most types of motor vehicles is mandatory in almost all countries and many countries have strict laws regarding the use of seatbelts while in vehicles. In addition, most developed countries require that seats in intercity buses and commercial vehicles be fitted with seatbelts. In the U.S., federal legislation requires frontal airbags on the driver-side and the passenger-side of all new passenger cars and in all new light vehicles, which are defined as vehicles with an unloaded vehicle weight of approximately 7,700 pounds or less.
 
For information concerning the material effects on our business relating to our compliance with government safety regulations, see “Risk Factors – ‘Our business may be adversely affected by laws or regulations, including environmental, occupational health and safety or other governmental regulations’ and ‘Our business may be adversely affected by changes in automotive safety regulations or concerns that drive further regulation of the automobile safety market’” in Item 1A of this Annual Report and in Item 7 under the section “Risks and Risk Management” of this Annual Report.
