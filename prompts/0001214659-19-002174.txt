ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
On November 10, 2014, Uniroyal Global Engineered Products, Inc. (“Uniroyal Global”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) acquired all of the ownership interests in Uniroyal Engineered Products, LLC (“Uniroyal”), a U.S. manufacturer of textured coatings, and all of the ordinary common stock of Engineered Products Acquisition Limited (“EPAL”, now known as Uniroyal Global (Europe) Limited (“UGEL”)), the holding company for Wardle Storeys (Earby) Limited (“Wardle Storeys,” now known as Uniroyal Global Limited), a European manufacturer of textured coatings and polymer films. Management of the acquired entities was not altered in the acquisitions.
 
Uniroyal Global made the acquisition of Uniroyal through a newly formed subsidiary, UEP Holdings, LLC (“UEPH”), to which it contributed certain of its assets and liabilities as part of the organization of that subsidiary. The aggregate purchase consideration paid for 100% of the outstanding equity of Uniroyal was preferred ownership interests issued by UEPH having an aggregate face value of $35 million. In a separate transaction, Uniroyal Global also purchased UGEL for aggregate consideration of 100 shares of Uniroyal Global’s Common Stock and Uniroyal Global’s guaranty of outstanding UGEP preferred stock retained by the seller having a face value of £12,518,240 (approximately $20 million at closing). 
 
We are a manufacturer and seller of vinyl coated fabrics products that have excellent high performance characteristics and capabilities and derive our revenue principally through our subsidiaries Uniroyal and Uniroyal Global Limited.   Our coated fabrics products are durable, stain resistant, easily processed, cost-effective and better performing than traditional leather or fabric coverings.  Our products are frequently used in applications that require rigorous performance characteristics such as automotive and non-automotive transportation, certain indoor/outdoor furniture, commercial and hospitality seating, healthcare facilities and athletic equipment.   In the automotive industry our products are used primarily in seating, door panels, head and arm rests, security shades and trim components, including instrument panels, door casings, seating, gear lever and steering column gaiters, headliners and load space covers.  Non-automotive applications include outdoor seating for utility and sports vehicles, and sheeting used in medical and toxic hazard protection, personal protection, moisture barriers, pram and nursery equipment, movie screen and decorative surface applications. Our primary brands names include Naugahyde®, BeautyGard®, Flame Blocker™, Spirit Millennium®, Ambla®, Amblon®, Velbex®, Cirroflex®, Plastolene® and Vynide®.
 
We are the successor to a long line of businesses that have manufactured vinyl coated fabrics.  Our best known brand, Naugahyde, is the product of many improvements on an original rubber-coated fabric developed a century ago in Naugatuck, Connecticut.  We design, manufacture and market a wide selection of vinyl coated fabric products under a portfolio of recognized brand names.   We believe that our business has continued to be a leading supplier in its marketplace because of our ability to provide specialized materials with high performance characteristics often customized to the end-user specifications and complemented by comprehensive technical and customer support.

Our Principal Products and Their Markets
 
Our vinyl coated fabrics products have undergone considerable evolution and today are distinguished by superior performance in a wide variety of applications as alternatives to leather, cloth and other synthetic fabric coverings. Our standard product lines consist of more than 600 SKUs with combinations of colors, textures, patterns and other properties. Our products are differentiated by unique protective top finishes and surface print capabilities. Additional process capabilities include embossing grains and patterns, and rotogravure and registered printing, which imparts five color character prints as well as non-registered prints, lamination and panel cutting.
 
Our vinyl coated fabrics products have various high performance characteristics and capabilities. They are durable, stain resistant, easily processed, more cost-effective and better performing than traditional leather or fabric coverings. Our products are frequently used in applications that require rigorous performance characteristics such as automotive and non-automotive transportation, certain indoor/outdoor furniture, commercial and hospitality seating, healthcare facilities and athletic equipment. We manufacture materials in a wide range of colors and textures. They can be hand or machine sewn, laminated to an underlying structure, thermoformed to cover various substrates or made into a variety of shapes for diverse end-uses.  We are a long-established supplier to the global automotive industry and manufacture products for interior trim components from floor to headliner which are produced to meet specific component production requirements such as cut and sew, vacuum forming/covering, compression molding, and high frequency welding. Some products are supplied with micro perforations, which are necessary on most compression molding processes. Materials can also be combined with polyurethane or polypropylene and foam laminated by either flame or hot melt adhesive for seating, fascia and door applications.

The contract sector, which represented approximately 10.7% of our 2018 sales, includes contract furniture/upholstery, marine, healthcare, child care, and industrial equipment.
 
Products are developed and marketed based upon the performance characteristics required by end-users. For example, for recreational products used outdoors, such as boats, personal watercraft, golf carts and snowmobiles, a product designed primarily for durability and weatherability is used. We also manufacture a line of products called BeautyGard®, with water-based topcoats that contain agents to protect against bacterial and fungal microorganisms and can withstand repeated cleaning, a necessity in the restaurant and health care industries. These topcoats are environmentally friendlier than solvent-based topcoats. The line is widely used in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. Flame and smoke retardant vinyl coated fabrics are used for a variety of commercial and institutional furniture applications, including hospitals, restaurants and residential care centers and seats for school buses, trains and aircraft.
 
We produce vinyl coated fabrics and laminated composites through a continuous cast or spread coating manufacturing process. The continuous cast method yields a material with a soft finish, deep grain pattern, wide temperature tolerance range and high malleability factor for thermoforming. In addition, we possess plastisol-compounding capability, a variety of proprietary formulations and highly versatile finishing processes. We believe that our products are differentiated in the market by unique protective topcoat finishes and adhesive back coats, as well as five color register and rotogravure printing, which imparts multiple features, character prints and non-registered prints. We also have the in-house capability to perform transfer printing as well as micro-perforation, which provides product breathability.
 
We seek to ensure that every product fully meets customer requirements of specifications, reliability and performance.
 
We believe that we maintain our market leadership position through a strong research and development effort that provides strong product development capability. This yields enhanced product characteristics, lower cost of material combinations and new proprietary product formulations. We estimate that approximately 14.8% of our sales relate to products developed to customer specifications.
 
 Our Stoughton, Wisconsin facility achieved ISO 9001:2008 status in 1999 and has renewed it annually since then. In addition, the facility achieved IATF 16949:2016 status in 2018. Our U.K. facility achieved ISO TS 16949 status in 2004 and is approved to the European Council Directive 96/98 EX on Marine Equipment as amended for Module D Production Quality.
 
We hold no patents but maintain certain of our process technologies as trade secrets.

Employees
 
We believe that we maintain a stable, experienced and productive workforce, currently employing a total of 393 employees.
 
Most of our employees who are involved in the production process are located at manufacturing facilities in Stoughton, Wisconsin and Earby, England. The production employees at the Stoughton, Wisconsin facility are represented by Local 1207 of the United Steel Workers (formerly P.A.C.E.). The term of the collective bargaining agreement for Stoughton represented employees extends to March 2023. Most of the employees at our Earby facility are represented by UNITE.  The collective bargaining agreement with UNITE does not specify a termination date.
 
Fourteen executive and corporate employees work in our executive office in Sarasota, Florida.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Government Regulations on Our Business
 
Our manufacturing processes are subject to increasingly stringent regulation by environmental, health and safety authorities. It is difficult to predict future changes in environmental, health and safety regulations on our future financial results. Continued compliance could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs. Any increase in these costs, or unanticipated liabilities, arising out of a release of regulated material, discovery of previously unknown conditions, more aggressive enforcement actions or new requirements, could adversely affect our financial results.

Research and Development
 
We are actively engaged in research and development programs designed to develop new products, manufacturing processes, systems and technologies, while reducing costs to customers and enhancing existing product lines. We believe that investment in research and development has been an important factor in establishing and maintaining our competitive position in many of the specialized niche markets in which our products are sold. Product performance capabilities and characteristics are continually adjusted to meet customer needs.
 
In-house design and innovative product development are key features of our business.  Our in-house design studio enables us to develop new designs, colors and patterns for customers and then deliver them in prototype sample form or by computer-aided design (CAD).
 
We have access to a vast range of leather and grain styles, prints and surface effects, which are constantly evolving and increasing. Further trends are captured and expressed in our own concept work and exclusive designs are developed from customer requests. Our CAD systems allow fast creation and display of design innovation. “Drape” software enables computer generated designs to be shown in situ in interiors of vehicles or other applications before the expense of production is incurred. A silicone cast surface-modeling system permits the transfer of material surface finishes, including leather and fabrics, onto vinyl foils for customer review before investment in tooling. Diverse production systems and equipment create an extensive automotive product range. Anti-stain and anti-squeak finish (ASF) are examples of product developments providing customers with cost reduction and material performance enhancements.
 
We spent $1,653,234 in 2018 and $1,940,671 in 2017 for research and development.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.  We have not needed to make any material expenditure to maintain such compliance during the past two fiscal years. However, during 2018 we invested approximately $1.7 million at our Earby facility for a regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO) to enhance the treatment of exhaust air.
 
We aim to comply with all existing regulatory legislation at European, national and local levels and adopt a positive stance in anticipating future, more stringent regulatory requirements. We endeavor to minimize waste throughout the production facilities with better utilization of raw materials, energy and water and to prevent at the source the emission of pollutants into the environment. We are committed to continual improvements in environmental performance.
 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax laws that affect our business. These changes included, but were not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. See Note 11 in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.
