Item 1.  Business
Description of the Business and Background 
LivaNova PLC, headquartered in London, (collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “LivaNova”, “we” or “our”), is a global medical device company focused on the development and delivery of important therapeutic solutions for the benefit of patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems throughout the world. Working closely with our global team of medical professionals in the fields of Cardiac Surgery and Neuromodulation, we design, develop, manufacture and sell innovative therapeutic solutions that are consistent with our mission to improve our patients’ quality of life, increase the skills and capabilities of healthcare professionals and minimize healthcare costs. 
We were organized under the laws of England and Wales on February 20, 2015 for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of Cyberonics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Cyberonics”) and Sorin S.p.A., a joint stock company organized under the laws of Italy (“Sorin”). The business combination of Cyberonics and Sorin (the “Merger”) became effective on October 19, 2015, at which time LivaNova’s ordinary shares were listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market (“NASDAQ”) and the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”) under the trading symbol “LIVN.” On April 5, 2017, we delisted from the LSE and are currently only listed for trading on the NASDAQ. For further information regarding the business combination, refer to “Note 3. Business Combinations” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Business Franchises
LivaNova is comprised of two principal Business Franchises, which are also our reportable segments: Cardiac Surgery and Neuromodulation, corresponding to our primary therapeutic areas. Other corporate activities include corporate business development and New Ventures, focused on new growth platforms and identification of other opportunities for expansion. 
On November 20, 2017, we entered into a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) to sell our Cardiac Rhythm Management Business Franchise (“CRM”) to MicroPort Scientific Corporation for $190 million in cash. We expect to enter into the definitive acquisition agreement contemplated by the LOI following completion of the notification and consultation process with CRM’s employee works councils as required by local laws. Completion of the transaction is subject to entry into the definitive acquisition agreement, receipt of relevant regulatory approvals, including fulfilling the requirements of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Major Transaction requirements, and other customary closing conditions. We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2018. Accordingly, the results of operations of the CRM Business Franchise are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and related assets and liabilities are presented as held for sale.
For further information regarding our business segments, historical financial information and our methodology for the presentation of financial results, please refer to the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cardiac Surgery
Our Cardiac Surgery Business Franchise (“CS”) is engaged in the development, production and sale of cardiac surgery products, including oxygenators, heart-lung machines, perfusion tubing systems, cannulae and other accessories used for extracorporeal circulation, systems for autologous blood transfusion and blood washing, as well as a complete line of surgical tissue and mechanical heart valve replacements and repair products.
Cardiopulmonary Products 
During conventional coronary artery bypass graft procedures and heart valve surgery, the patient’s heart is temporarily stopped, or arrested. The patient is placed on an extracorporeal circulatory support system that temporarily functions as the patient’s heart and lungs and provides blood flow to the body. Our products include systems to enable cardiopulmonary bypass, including heart-lung machines, oxygenators, perfusion tubing sets, cannulae and accessories, as well as related equipment and disposables for autotransfusion and autologous blood washing for neonatal, pediatric and adult patients. Our primary cardiopulmonary products include: 
 Heart-lung machines. The heart-lung machine (“HLM”) product group includes heart-lung machines, heater coolers, related cardiac surgery equipment and maintenance services. 
6

Oxygenators and perfusion tubing systems. The oxygenators product group, which includes oxygenators and other disposable devices for extracorporeal circulation, includes the Inspire systems. The Inspire range of products, comprised of 12 models, provides perfusionists with a customizable approach for the benefit of patients. 
Connect. Connect is our perfusion charting system. Focused on real time and retrospective calculations and trending tools, Connect assists perfusionists with data management during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. 
Heartlink. Heartlink is our goal-directed perfusion system linking the Connect perfusion charting system with the Inspire oxygenator to achieve a better outcome by adapting adequacy of perfusion to the patient, thus reducing post-operative complications and Intensive Care Unit and hospital length of stay. Inspire, Heartlink and Connect products can all be integrated with our HLM machines to deliver a unique perfusion solution combining hardware components, disposable devices and data management systems and can all be integrated with our HLM machines to deliver a unique perfusion solution. 
Autotransfusion systems. One of the key elements for a complete blood management strategy is autologous blood transfusion, which involves the collection, processing and reinfusion of the patient’s own blood lost at the surgical site during the peri-operative period. 
Cannulae. Our cannulae product family, part of the oxygenator product group, is used to connect the extracorporeal circulation to the heart of the patient during cardiac surgery.
Heart Valves and Repair Products 
We offer a comprehensive line of products to treat a variety of heart valve disorders, including a complete line of surgical tissue and mechanical valve replacements and repair products for damaged or diseased heart valves. Our heart valves and repair product offerings include: 
 Tissue heart valves. Our tissue valves include the Mitroflow aortic pericardial tissue valve with phospholipid reduction treatment (“PRT”) which is designed to mitigate valve calcification, and the Crown PRT and Solo Smart aortic pericardial tissue valves. CROWN PRT is the latest advancement in stented aortic bioprosthesis technology, featuring surgeon-friendly design, PRT technology, and state-of-the-art hemodynamic and durability performance. CROWN PRT enables intuitive intraoperative handling through a short rinse time, enhanced ease of implant through visible markers and improved radiographic visualization through dedicated X-ray markers. Our Solo Smart aortic pericardial tissue valve is an innovative, completely biological aortic heart valve with no synthetic material and a removable stent. Solo Smart provides the ease of implantation of a stented valve with the hemodynamic performance of a stentless valve. 
 Self-anchoring tissue heart valves. Perceval is LivaNova’s sutureless bioprosthetic device designed to replace a diseased native valve or a malfunctioning prosthetic aortic valve using either traditional or minimally invasive heart surgery techniques. Perceval incorporates a unique technology that allows 100% sutureless positioning and anchoring at the implantation site. This, in turn, offers the potential benefit of reducing the time the patient spends in cardiopulmonary bypass.
Mechanical heart valves. Our wide range of mechanical valve offerings includes the Carbomedics Standard, Top Hat and Reduced Series Aortic Valves, as well as the Carbomedics Carbo-Seal and Carbo-Seal Valsalva aortic prostheses. We also offer the Carbomedics Standard, Orbis and Optiform mechanical mitral valves and Bicarbon Slimline, Bicarbon Fitline and Bicarbon Overline aortic and mitral valves.
Heart valve repair products. Mitral valve repair is a well-established solution for patients suffering from a leaky mitral valve, or mitral regurgitation. We offer a wide range of mitral valve repair products, including the Memo 3D and Memo 3D ReChord, AnnuloFlo and AnnuloFlex. 
Neuromodulation
Our Neuromodulation Business Franchise designs, develops and markets neuromodulation-based medical devices for the treatment of epilepsy and depression. 
7

Neuromodulation Products
Our seminal neuromodulation product, the VNS Therapy® System, is an implantable device authorized for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression (“TRD”). The VNS Therapy System consists of: an implantable pulse generator and connective lead that work to stimulate the vagus nerve; surgical equipment to assist with the implant procedure; equipment and instruction manuals enabling a treating physician to set parameters for a patient’s pulse generator; and for epilepsy, magnets to manually suspend or induce nerve stimulation. The VNS Therapy pulse generator and lead are surgically implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the upper left chest area, generally during an out-patient procedure; the lead (which does not need to be removed to replace a generator with a depleted battery) is connected to the pulse generator and tunneled under the skin to the vagus nerve in the lower left side of the patient’s neck. 
VNS therapy for the treatment of epilepsy. Globally, there are several broad types of treatment available to persons with epilepsy: multiple seizure medications, various forms of the ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation, resective brain surgery, trigeminal nerve stimulation, responsive intracranial neurostimulation and deep brain stimulation. Seizure medications typically serve as a first-line treatment and are prescribed for virtually all patients diagnosed with epilepsy. After two seizure medications fail to deliver seizure control, the epilepsy is defined as drug-resistant, at which point, adjunctive non-drug options are considered, including VNS therapy, brain surgery and a ketogenic diet. 
In the U.S., our VNS Therapy System was the first medical device treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in 1997 for refractory, drug-resistant epilepsy in adults and adolescents over 12 years of age and is indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures. Other worldwide regulatory bodies have also approved the VNS Therapy System for the treatment of epilepsy, many without age restrictions or seizure-type limitations. Patients with epilepsy can also use a small, handheld magnet provided with our VNS Therapy System to activate or inhibit stimulation manually. We sell a number of VNS product models for the treatment of epilepsy, including our Model 102 (PulseTM), Model 102R (Pulse DuoTM), Model 103 (Demipulse®), Model 104 (Demipulse Duo®), Model 105 (AspireHC®) and Model 106 (AspireSR®) and the Model 1000 (SenTivaTM) pulse generators. To date, an estimated 110,000 patients have been treated with our VNS Therapy System for epilepsy. 
Our AspireSR generator provides the benefits of VNS Therapy, with an additional feature: automatic stimulation in response to detection of changes in heart rate potentially indicative of a seizure. The AspireSR generator is capable of delivering additional stimulation automatically by responding to a patient’s relative heart-rate changes that exceed certain variable thresholds, which are adjustable. Heart-rate changes accompany seizure activity in certain patients. The thresholds are programmed by the patient’s physician and can be adjusted to suit the patient’s level of physical activity or for other reasons. In October 2017, we obtained FDA approval to market our SenTiva VNS Therapy System, which consists of the SenTiva implantable generator and the next-generation VNS Therapy Programming System. The SenTiva generator is the smallest and lightest device capable of delivering responsive therapy for epilepsy. The SenTiva VNS Therapy Programming System features a wireless wand and a new user interface on a small tablet. Together, these components offer patients with drug-resistant epilepsy a physician-directed, customizable therapy with smart technology that reduces the number of seizures, lessens the duration of seizures and enables a faster recovery.
In June 2017, the FDA approved our VNS Therapy device for use in patients who are at least four years of age and have partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic medications. VNS Therapy is the first and only FDA-approved device for drug-resistant epilepsy in this pediatric population. Previously, VNS Therapy was approved by the FDA for patients 12 years or older.
In addition, in June 2017, we received FDA approval, and in August 2017, we received CE Mark approval, for our VNS Therapy device for expanded magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) labeling affirming VNS Therapy as the only epilepsy device approved by the FDA for MRI scans. Currently, SenTiva, AspireHC and AspireSR models of VNS Therapy technology provide for this expanded MRI access.
VNS for the treatment of depression. In July 2005, the FDA approved the VNS Therapy System for the adjunctive treatment of chronic or recurrent depression for patients 18 years or older who are experiencing a major depressive episode and have not had an adequate response to four or more antidepressant treatments. In May 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a national determination of non-coverage within the United States with respect to reimbursement of the VNS Therapy System for patients with TRD, significantly limiting access to this therapeutic option for most patients. As the result of lack of access following this determination, we have not engaged in significant commercial efforts with respect to TRD in any of our markets. As a result of new clinical evidence, including the completion of a post-approval dosing study and other studies that have resulted in more than five publications in peer-reviewed journals, we submitted a formal request to CMS for reconsideration of VNS therapy for TRD. CMS declined our request for reconsideration in May 2013. In October 2013, two 
8

Medicare beneficiaries appealed the lack of coverage by Medicare through the Departmental Appeals Board (“DAB”) of the Department of Health and Human Services. In January 2015, the DAB concluded that the record relating to the non-coverage conclusion by CMS is complete and adequately supports the non-coverage determination.
Discontinued Operations Cardiac Rhythm Management Business Franchise
CRM, presented as discontinued operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, develops, manufactures and markets products for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of heart rhythm disorders and heart failure. For more information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Corporate Activities and New Ventures
Corporate activities include shared services for finance, legal, human resources and information technology, corporate business development and New Ventures. 
The New Ventures group evaluates growth opportunities and new potential areas of investment for the Company to expand our product portfolio to meet emerging patient needs. In particular, New Ventures focuses on innovative technologies to treat three main pathologies: heart failure, sleep apnea and mitral valve regurgitation, areas of unmet clinical need where there is no optimal therapeutic solution for the majority of patients. New Ventures partners with public and private institutions and medical startups to develop future therapeutic solutions in these areas. 
Research and Development (“R&D”)
The markets in which we participate are subject to rapid technological advances. Product improvement and innovation are necessary to maintain market leadership. Our R&D efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible. We remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new uses for existing products and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs. That commitment leads us to initiate and participate in many clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high. We also expect our development activities to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future. 
Approximately 20% of our employees work in R&D improving existing products and therapies, expanding their uses and applications and developing new products. We continue to focus on optimizing innovation and assessing the ability of our R&D programs to deliver economic value to the customer. More specifically, our current R&D expenses consist of product design and development efforts, clinical study programs and regulatory activities, which are essential to the Company’s strategic portfolio initiatives, including TMVR, Treatment Resistant Depression and Heart Failure. 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015, we spent $109.7 million, $82.5 million, $41.9 million and $42.2 million on R&D, respectively. 
Acquisitions and Investments
Our strategy of providing a broad range of therapies requires a wide variety of technologies, products and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through research and development efforts, we have historically relied, and expect to continue to rely, on acquisitions, investments and alliances to provide access to new technologies in both new and existing markets. 
We expect to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses by making future acquisitions or investments in areas that we believe we can acquire or stimulate the development of new technologies and products. Mergers and acquisitions of medical technology companies are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that any of our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
Caisson Interventional, LLC 
On May 2, 2017, we acquired the remaining 51% equity interests in Caisson Interventional, LLC (“Caisson”). Caisson, a clinical-stage medical device company based in Maple Grove, Minnesota, is focused on the design, development and clinical evaluation of a novel transcatheter mitral valve replacement (“TMVR”) implant device for treating mitral regurgitation through 
9

replacement of the native mitral valve using a fully transvenous delivery system. The financial results of Caisson are included within New Ventures.
ImThera Medical, Inc.
On January 16, 2018, we acquired ImThera Medical, Inc. (“ImThera”). We previously held 14% of ImThera’s outstanding equity. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., ImThera was a privately held company focused on neurostimulation for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (“OSA”). ImThera manufactures an implantable device that stimulates multiple tongue muscles via the hypoglossal nerve, which opens the airway while a patient is sleeping. The ImThera device is highly aligned with our Neuromodulation Business Franchise, and we plan to optimize the technology. In the near term, we plan to focus on expanding ImThera’s current commercial presence in the European market, while advancing enrollment in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration pivotal study.
Patents and Licenses 
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2017, we held more than 1,900 issued patents worldwide, with approximately 400 pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technology, including CRM. Patents typically have a 20-year term from the application filing date. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and pending patent applications. There can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage. We have also obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products and maintain certain details about our processes, products and strategies as trade secrets. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets are considered to be of material importance to our business segments and operations. We regularly review third-party patents and patent applications in an effort to protect our intellectual property and avoid disputes over proprietary rights. 
We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.
For additional information, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the section entitled “Risk Factors Relating to LivaNova’s Business-We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing its patent and other proprietary rights against others.”
Markets and Distribution Methods
The three largest markets for our medical devices are Europe, the United States and Japan. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity. We sell most of our medical devices through direct sales representatives in the United States and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the United States.
Our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide, including perfusionists, neurologists, neurosurgeons and other physicians, hospitals and other medical institutions and healthcare providers. To achieve this objective, we maintain a highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales staff that is able to foster strong relationships with such a range of customers. We maintain excellent working relationships with professionals in the medical industry, which provides us with a detailed understanding of therapeutic and diagnostic developments, trends and emerging opportunities, enabling us to respond quickly to the changing needs of providers and patients. We actively participate in medical meetings and conduct comprehensive training and educational activities in an effort to enhance our presence in the medical community, and we believe that these activities also contribute to healthcare professionals’ expertise. 
Due to the emphasis on cost-effectiveness in healthcare delivery, the current trend among hospitals and other medical device customers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups in order to enhance purchasing power. As a result, customer transactions have become increasingly complex. Enhanced purchasing power may also lead to pressure on pricing and an increase in the use of preferred vendors. Our customer base continues to evolve to reflect such economic changes across the geographic markets we serve.
10

Competition and Industry
We compete in the medical device market in more than 5,000 hospitals in more than 100 countries. This market is characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. Our competitors across our product portfolio range from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of specialized products. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies and providers of cannabis.
Product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts and publications about our products can cause major shifts in industry market share, reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry. In addition, because of developments in managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we may be increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes and successfully market these products. 
Cardiac Surgery
Our competitors include Terumo Medical Corporation, Maquet Medical Systems, Medtronic Plc, Haemonetics Corporation, Edwards Lifesciences Corp. and Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (formerly St. Jude Medical, Inc.), although not all competitors are present in all product lines. 
Neuromodulation
Our primary medical device competitors in the Neuromodulation product group are NeuroPace, Inc. and Medtronic Plc.
Production, Quality Systems and Raw Materials
We manufacture a majority of our products at 10 manufacturing facilities located in Italy, Germany, the United States, Canada, Brazil and Australia. We purchase raw materials and many of the components used in our manufacturing facilities from numerous suppliers in various countries. For quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness purposes, we may procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. 
The quality systems we utilize in the design, production, warehousing and distribution of our products are designed to ensure that our products are safe and effective. Some of the governmental agencies and quality system regulations with which we are required to comply are as follows:

• | The FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) under section 520 of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations at 21 C.F.R. Part 820.


• | The International Standards Organization - (“ISO”) EN ISO 13485:2012, Medical devices - Quality management systems.


• | The independent certification bodies, DEKRA, LNE/G-MED and TUV SUD, which act as our notified bodies to ensure that our manufacturing quality systems comply with ISO 13485:2003.


• | The European Council Directives 93/42/EEC and 90/385/EEC, ISO 13485, which relates to medical devices and active implantable medical devices.

In addition, we utilize environmental management systems and safety programs to protect the environment and our employees. Some of the regulations and governmental agencies with which we comply are as follows: 

• | The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”)


• | The Occupational Health and Safety Assessment System (“OSHAS”)


• | The European Union Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”)


• | Italian regulations under the Integrated Environmental Authorization acts


• | ISO 14001 certification

11

Government Regulation and Other Considerations
Our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and counterpart agencies outside the United States. To varying degrees, each of these agencies require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, pre-market clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, advertising, promotion, record keeping, reporting, tracking, and importing and exporting of medical devices. Our business is also affected by patient privacy and security laws, cost containment initiatives, and environmental health and safety laws and regulations worldwide. The primary laws and regulations that affect our business are described below. 
The laws applicable to LivaNova are subject to changing and evolving interpretations. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines and damages, and exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by government programs, among other potential enforcement actions. 
United States 
Each medical device we seek to distribute commercially in the United States must first receive 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval from the FDA, unless specifically exempted by the agency. The FDA groups medical devices into one of three classes - Class I, Class II or Class III - depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) pre-market notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution of the device in the United States. Some low-risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device, are categorized as Class III, requiring approval of an application for pre-market approval (“PMA”). 
510(k) Clearance Process 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, LivaNova must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared 510(k) device, a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of approval PMA application, or a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I. In rare cases, Class III devices may be cleared through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent device modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until the manufacturer obtains a 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application. In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements, including which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, the ability to rescind previously granted 510(k) clearances and additional requirements that may significantly impact the process. 
Pre-market Approval Process 
Manufacturers must submit a PMA application for all Class III medical devices (although the FDA has the discretion to continue to allow certain pre-amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process) and all other medical devices that cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA application typically must be supported by, among other things, extensive technical, pre-clinical and clinical study data, and manufacturing and labeling data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction.
After a manufacturer files a PMA application, the FDA begins an in-depth review process, which typically takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, the FDA often convenes an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, which imposes elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures related to the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-
12

approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported the approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in a materially adverse enforcement action, including, among other things, the loss or withdrawal of the approval. Manufacturers must submit a new PMA application or a PMA supplement for approval of significant modifications to the design, indications, labeling or manufacturing process of a PMA-approved device. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require extensive clinical data as extensive as the original PMA application, the convening of an advisory panel or pre-approval inspections. 
Clinical Studies 
One or more clinical studies may be required to support a 510(k) application and are almost always required to support a PMA application. Manufacturers must conduct clinical studies of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or devices intended for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) in compliance with FDA requirements. If human clinical studies of a device are required and the device presents a significant risk, the sponsor of the study must file an investigational device exemption (“IDE”), application prior to commencing the study. The IDE application must be supported by data, typically including the results of animal and/or laboratory testing. If the IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more institutional review boards (“IRBs”), human clinical studies may begin at a specific number of institutional investigational sites with the specific number of patients approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical study after obtaining approval for the study by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA. During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements including, for example, investigator selection, monitoring of the clinical study sites, adverse event reporting and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. We, the FDA and the IRB at each institution at which a clinical study is being conducted may suspend a clinical study at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. 
Continuing Regulation 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing in the United States, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply, and we will continue to be subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine its compliance with these requirements, as will its suppliers, contract manufacturers and contract testing laboratories. These requirements include, among others: 

• | the QSR, which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test, manufacture, modify, label, exercise quality control over and document manufacturing and quality issues regarding their products;


• | Establishment Registration, which requires establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices intended for commercial distribution in the United States, to register with the FDA;


• | Medical Device Listing, which requires manufacturers to list with the FDA the devices they have in commercial distribution;


• | Labeling and claims regulations, which require that all advertising and promotion of devices be truthful, not misleading and fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use, and that all claims be substantiated;


• | Prohibition of marketing devices for off-label uses, including requirements relating to dissemination of articles and information and responding to unsolicited requests for off-label information;


• | Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) regulations, which requires reporting to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if a device has malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;


• | Reporting and record keeping for certain corrections or removals initiated by a manufacturer to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health;


• | Statutory and regulatory requirements for Unique Device Identifiers (“UDIs”) on devices and submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (“GUDID”); and


• | In some cases, ongoing monitoring and tracking of a device’s performance and periodic reporting to the FDA of such performance results.

13

The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. The FDA periodically inspects our manufacturing facilities, which potentially includes our suppliers. If the FDA observes conditions that may constitute violations, we must correct the conditions or satisfactorily demonstrate the absence of the violations. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by us. We continue to expend resources to maintain compliance with our obligations under the FDA’s regulations. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include one or more of the following sanctions:

• | untitled letters or warning letters;


• | fines, injunctions and civil penalties;


• | mandatory recall or seizure of our products;


• | administrative detention or banning of our products;


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;


• | refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new product versions;


• | revocation of 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals previously granted; and


• | criminal prosecution and penalties.

Other than the U.S. 
Outside the United States, we are subject to government regulation in the countries in which we operate. Although many of the regulations applicable to our products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA, these regulations vary significantly from country to country and with respect to the nature of the particular medical device. The time required to obtain foreign approvals to market our products may be longer or shorter than the time required in the United States, and requirements for such approvals may differ from FDA requirements. 
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, (which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union (“EU”) plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland), a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE mark. To obtain CE mark certification, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety and quality (i.e., the essential requirements) set out in the EU Medical Devices Directives (Council Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices and Council Directive 90/385/EEC on Active Implantable Medical Devices). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices, where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directives, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments by a Notified Body. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body typically audits and examines the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the manufacturer’s devices. Following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body issues a certificate that entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. Manufacturers with CE marked devices are subject to regular inspections by Notified Bodies to monitor continued compliance with the applicable directives and essential requirements. 
As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device (e.g., product labeling and instructions for use) are supported by suitable evidence. 
In the EEA, clinical studies for medical devices usually require the approval of an Ethics Committee and approval by or notification to the national competent authorities. Both regulators and Ethics Committees also typically require the submission of adverse event reports during a study and may request a copy of the final study report.
The national competent authorities of the EEA countries, generally in the form of their ministries or departments of health, oversee the clinical research for medical devices and are responsible for market surveillance of products once they are placed 
14

on the market. We are required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use to these authorities in a timely manner. Various penalties exist for non-compliance with the laws setting forth the medical device directives.
In September 2012, the European Commission published proposals for the revision of the EU regulatory framework for medical devices. The proposal would replace the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive with a new regulation (the “Medical Devices Regulation”). Unlike the Directives that must be implemented into national laws, the Regulation would be directly applicable in all EEA Member States and so is intended to eliminate current national differences in regulation of medical devices.
In October 2013, the European Parliament approved a package of reforms to the European Commission’s proposals. Under the revised proposals, only designated “special notified bodies” would be entitled to conduct conformity assessments of high-risk devices, such as active implantable devices. These special notified bodies will need to notify the European Commission when they receive an application for a conformity assessment for a new high-risk device. The European Commission will then forward the notification and the accompanying documents on the device to the Medical Devices Coordination Group (“MDCG”), (a new, yet to be created, body chaired by the European Commission, and representatives of Member States) for an opinion. These new procedures may result in the re-assessment of our existing medical devices, or a longer or more burdensome assessment of our new products. In May 2016, a political agreement was reached and the tentatively agreed upon text was published in June 2016. In April 2017, Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices (“Reg MDR”) was published, beginning a three-year transition period. At the end of this transition period, national competent authorities, Notified Bodies and manufacturers must implement and ensure compliance with the changes enacted in the Reg MDR. Among other things, this new regulation imposes additional reporting requirements on manufacturers of high risk medical devices, imposes an obligation on manufacturers to appoint a “qualified person” responsible for regulatory compliance, and provides for stricter clinical evidence requirements. We have initiated activities to ensure compliance with the MDR by the end of the transition period.
To be sold in Japan, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they are granted approval, or “shonin.” The Japanese government, through the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (“MHLW”), regulates medical devices under the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (“PAL”). Oversight for medical devices is conducted with participation by the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”), a quasi-government organization performing many of the review functions for MHLW. Penalties for a company’s noncompliance with PAL can be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions. MHLW and PMDA also assess the quality management systems of the manufacturer and product conformity to the requirements of the PAL. We are subject to compliance inspections by these agencies. 
Many countries in which we operate (outside of the EU, United States and Japan) have their own regulatory requirements for medical devices. Most countries outside of the EU, United States and Japan require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries. Because export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations are complex and constantly changing, we cannot ensure that laws and regulations may not be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our ability to sell or distribute our products. 
Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, existing regulations. Certain regulators are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect that this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products, or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future. We cannot provide assurance that any new medical devices we develop will be approved in a timely or cost-effective manner, or approved at all.

Promotional Restrictions
Both before and after we release a product for commercial distribution, we have ongoing responsibilities under various laws and regulations governing medical devices. In addition to FDA regulatory requirements, the FDA and other U.S. regulatory bodies (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice and various state Attorneys General) monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our products. Although physicians are permitted to use their medical judgment to employ medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we are prohibited from promoting products for such “off-label” uses and can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. 
Governmental Trade Regulations 
The sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subjects us to extensive governmental trade regulations. A variety of laws and regulations apply to the sale, shipment and provision of goods, services and technology across international borders. Many countries control the export and re-export of goods, technology and services for public health, national security, regional stability, antiterrorism and other reasons. Some governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons or entities. In certain circumstances, governmental authorities may require that we obtain an approval before we export or re-export goods, technology or services to certain destinations, to certain end-users and for certain end-uses. Because we are subject to extensive regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import and export activities. 
We also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users, and if these third parties violate applicable export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations when engaging in transactions involving our products, we may be subject to varying degrees of liability depending on the extent of our participation in the transaction. The activities of these third parties may cause disruption or delays in the distribution and sales of our products, or result in restrictions being placed on our international distribution and sales of products, which may materially impact our business activities. 
Patient Privacy and Security Laws 
Various laws worldwide protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers. Privacy standards in Europe and Asia are becoming increasingly strict, enforcement action and financial penalties related to privacy in the EU are growing, and new laws and restrictions are being passed. The management of cross-border transfers of information among and outside of EU member countries is becoming more complex, which may complicate our clinical research activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data. We will continue our efforts to comply with those requirements and to adapt our business processes to those standards. 
In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys new general authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. We potentially operate as a business associate to covered entities in a limited number of instances. In those cases, the patient data that we receive may include protected health information, as defined under HIPAA. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. While we have not been named in any such actions, if a substantial breach or loss of data from our records were to occur, we could become a target of such litigation. 
In the EU, Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”) comes into force on 25 May 2018. The GDPR replaces Directive 95/46/EC (“Data Protection Directive”). While many of the principles of the GDPR reflect those of the Data Protection Directive, for example in relation to the requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of 
16

individually identifiable health information, there are a number of changes. In particular: (1) pro-active compliance measures are introduced, such as the requirement to carry out a Privacy Impact Assessment and to appoint a Data Protection Officer where health data is processed on a “large scale”. Although “large scale” is not defined, it is likely that clinical trials involving substantial numbers of patients (or healthy volunteers if applicable) would mean that such requirements apply to LivaNova; and (2) the administrative fines that can be levied are significantly increased, the maximum being the higher of €20 million, or 4%, of the total worldwide annual turnover of the group in the previous financial year.
Cost Containment Initiatives 
Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where LivaNova does business. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, private healthcare insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the extent of coverage or amount of reimbursement available for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs. Hospitals, which purchase implants, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, creating centralized purchasing functions that set pricing and in some cases limit the number of vendors that can participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning their interests with that of physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, whereby a hospital agrees with physicians to share certain realized cost savings resulting from the physicians’ collective change in practice patterns, such as standardization of devices where medically appropriate, and participation in affordable care organizations. Such alignment has created increasing levels of price sensitivity among customers for our products. 
Some third-party payers must also approve coverage and set reimbursement levels for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use the medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical device may be cleared for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers. In addition, some private third-party payers require that certain procedures or the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of coverage. 
In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), for example, has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States. Due to subsequent legislative amendments the excise tax has been suspended for the period January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, and, absent further legislative action, will be reinstated starting January 1, 2020.
In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. The Affordable Care Act also implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. 
International examples of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in markets significant to our business include Japan, where the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years. Such reviews may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or result in the denial of coverage for those procedures. As a result of our manufacturing efficiencies, cost controls and other cost-savings initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to respond to changes resulting from this worldwide trend toward cost containment; however, uncertainty remains as to the nature of any future legislation or other reforms, making it difficult for LivaNova to predict the potential impact of cost-containment trends on future operating results.

Applicability of Anti-Corruption Laws and Regulations
Our worldwide business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions where we operate. The FCPA can be used to prosecute companies in the United States for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the United States, if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country. The UK Bribery Act prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors There are similar laws and regulations applicable to LivaNova outside the United States, all of which are subject to evolving interpretations. For additional information, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the sections entitled “We are subject to substantial post-market government regulation and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations” and “Our failure to comply with rules relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, false claims and privacy and security laws may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation and business operations.”
Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws 
We are also subject to U.S. federal and state government healthcare regulation and enforcement and government regulations in non-U.S. countries in which it conducts its business. 
The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the U.S. government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. The majority of states in the U.S. also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions, and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
Additionally, violations of the False Claims Act can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant financial liability, in its investigation and prosecution of device and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act, in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, we anticipate that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
HIPAA includes federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors; knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program; willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense; and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes additional reporting requirements on certain device manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Device manufacturers must submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 
The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

Environmental Health and Safety Laws 
We are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations worldwide. Like other medical device companies, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials. To the best of our knowledge at this time, we do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
Working Capital Practices
Our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to ensure adequate supply of raw materials from suppliers and meet the product delivery needs of our customers. To meet the operational demands of our customers, we also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed more than 4,500 employees worldwide, inclusive of approximately 900 employed by our CRM Business Franchise. Our employees are vital to our success, and we are engaged in an ongoing effort to identify, hire, manage and maintain the talent necessary to meet our business objectives. We believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a highly competitive labor market due, in large part, to our competitive compensation and benefits and our rewarding work environment, fostering employee professional training and development and providing employees with opportunities to contribute to our continued growth and success. 
Seasonality
For all product segments, the number of medical procedures incorporating our product sales is generally lower during the summer months due to summer vacation schedules. This is particularly relevant to European countries.
