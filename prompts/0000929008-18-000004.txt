Item 1. Business.
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “WESCO” refers to WESCO International, Inc., and its subsidiaries and its predecessors unless the context otherwise requires. References to “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to WESCO and its subsidiaries.
The Company
WESCO International, Inc. (“WESCO International”), incorporated in 1993 and effectively formed in February 1994 upon acquiring a distribution business from Westinghouse Electric Corporation, is a leading North American-based distributor of products and provider of advanced supply chain management and logistics services used primarily in industrial, construction, utility, and commercial, institutional and government (“CIG”) markets. We are a leading provider of electrical, industrial, and communications maintenance, repair and operating ("MRO") and original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") products, construction materials, and advanced supply chain management and logistics services. Our primary product categories include general supplies, wire, cable and conduit, communications and security, electrical distribution and controls, lighting and sustainability, and automation, controls and motors.
We serve approximately 70,000 active customers globally through approximately 500 branches primarily located in North America, with operations in 15 additional countries and 10 distribution centers located in the United States and Canada. The Company employs approximately 9,100 employees worldwide. We distribute over 1,000,000 products, grouped into six categories, from more than 26,000 suppliers, utilizing a highly automated, proprietary electronic procurement and inventory replenishment system.
In addition, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of value-added capabilities, which includes supply chain management, logistics and transportation, procurement, warehousing and inventory management, as well as kitting, limited assembly of products and system installation. Our value-added capabilities, extensive geographic reach, experienced workforce and broad product and supply chain solutions have enabled us to grow our business and establish a leading position in North America.
Industry Overview
We operate in highly fragmented markets that include thousands of small regional and locally based, privately owned competitors. According to one industry publication, in 2017, the latest year for which market data is available, the five largest full-line electrical distributors in North America, including WESCO, accounted for approximately 33% of an estimated $100 billion-plus of electrical sales in North America. Our global account, integrated supply and OEM programs provide customers with regional, national, North American and global supply chain consolidation opportunities. The demand for these programs is driven primarily by the desire of companies to reduce operating expenses by outsourcing operational and administrative functions associated with the procurement, management and utilization of MRO supplies and OEM components. We believe that opportunities exist for expansion of these programs. The total potential in the United States for purchases of MRO and OEM supplies and services across all industrial distribution market segments and channels is estimated to be nearly $800 billion per a combination of industry sources.
According to various industry sources, electrical distribution industry sales have grown low-single-digits on average over the past three years, despite a low-single-digit decline in 2016. Growth in recent years has been driven by new products, technologies and applications. It is estimated that approximately 75% of electrical products sold in the United States are delivered to the end user through the distribution channel.

Markets and Customers
We have a large base of approximately 70,000 active customers across a diverse set of end markets. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 17% of our sales in 2017. No one customer accounted for more than 4% of our sales in 2017.
The following table outlines our sales breakdown by end market:

Year Ended December 31, | 2017 | 2016 | 2015
(percentages based on total sales) | | | 
Industrial | 37% | 36% | 39% 
Construction | 33% | 34% | 32% 
Utility | 16% | 16% | 15% 
Commercial, Institutional and Government | 14% | 14% | 14% 

Industrial. Sales to industrial customers of MRO, OEM, and construction products and services accounted for approximately 37% of our sales in 2017, compared to 36% in 2016. Industrial sales product categories include a broad range of electrical equipment and supplies as well as lubricants, pipe, valves, fittings, fasteners, cutting tools, power transmission, and safety products. In addition, OEM customers require a reliable supply of assemblies and components to incorporate into their own products as well as value-added services such as supplier consolidation, design and technical support, just-in-time supply and electronic commerce, and supply chain management.

In addition to a wide array of electrical products, we offer contractors communications products for projects related to IT/network modernization, physical security upgrades, broadband deployments, network security, and disaster recovery.
Utility. Sales to utilities and utility contractors accounted for approximately 16% of our sales in 2017 and 2016. Customers include large investor-owned utilities, rural electric cooperatives, municipal power authorities and contractors that serve these customers. We provide our utility customers with products and services to support the construction and maintenance of their generation, transmission and distribution systems along with an extensive range of products that meet their power plant MRO and capital projects needs. Materials management and procurement outsourcing arrangements are also important in this market, as cost pressures and deregulation have caused utility customers to seek improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of their supply chains.
Commercial, Institutional and Government. Sales to CIG customers accounted for approximately 14% of our sales in 2017 and 2016. Customers include schools, hospitals, property management firms, retailers and federal, state and local government agencies of all types, including federal contractors.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to grow organically at a rate greater than that of our industry while making accretive acquisitions. Our organic growth strategy focuses on enhancing our sales, technical expertise and customer service capabilities to acquire new customers and increase our sales to current customers, broaden our product and service offerings and expand our geographic footprint. We utilize LEAN continuous improvement initiatives on a company-wide basis to deliver operational excellence and improve productivity. We also extend our LEAN initiatives to customers to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and supply chains. In addition, we seek to develop a distinct competitive advantage through talent management and employee development processes and programs.
We have identified certain growth engines that we believe provide substantial opportunities for above-market growth, and have developed strategies to address each of these areas of opportunity. These growth engines are a combination of business models, selected end markets and product categories, as discussed below.
Grow Our Global Account Customer Relationships and Base. Our typical global account customer is a large, multi-location industrial or commercial company, a large utility, a major contractor, or a government or institutional customer. Our global account program is designed to provide customers with supply chain management services and cost reductions by coordinating and standardizing activity for MRO materials and OEM direct materials across their multiple locations, utilizing our broad geographic footprint and our largely integrated information technology platform. Comprehensive account plans are developed and managed at the local, national and international levels to prioritize activities, identify key performance measures, and track progress against 
2

objectives. We involve our preferred suppliers early in the implementation process to contribute expertise and product knowledge to accelerate program implementation and deliver cost savings and process improvements.
Through our growth initiatives, we plan to continue to expand the suite of products and services we offer to current customer sites, while increasing our reach to serve additional customer locations. We plan on expanding our customer base by capitalizing on our industry expertise and supply chain optimization capabilities.
Extend Our Position in Integrated Supply Programs. Our integrated supply programs focus on optimizing the supply chain and replacing the traditional multi-vendor, resource-intensive procurement process with a single, outsourced, automated process. Each integrated supply program employs our product and distribution expertise to reduce the number of suppliers, total procurement costs, and administrative expenses, while meeting the customers’ service needs and improving their operating controls. We believe that large customers will seek to utilize such services to consolidate and simplify their MRO and OEM supply chains.
We are expanding our position in North America as an integrated supply service provider by building upon established relationships within our large customer base and premier supplier network, and extending our services to additional customers and locations around the world. Our services are offered across all four of our end markets.
Expand Our Relationships with Construction Contractors. We support new construction, renovation and retrofit projects across a wide variety of vertical markets, including manufacturing, healthcare, education, enterprise data communications, telecommunications, energy and government infrastructure. We believe that significant cross selling opportunities exist for our electrical and communications products and expertise, and we are utilizing our global account and integrated supply programs, LEAN initiatives and project management expertise to capitalize on new non-residential construction opportunities.
Expand Products and Services for Utilities. Our investor-owned, public power and utility contractor customers continue to focus on improving grid reliability and operating efficiency, while reducing costs. As a result, we anticipate opportunities from distribution grid improvement and transmission expansion projects as well as the continued adoption of integrated supply programs. Accordingly, we are focused on expanding our logistical and project services and supply chain management programs to increase our scope of supply on the distribution grid, generation and other energy projects, including alternative energy projects.
Grow Industrial MRO and Safety Sales. Our sales of industrial MRO materials include a broad range of electrical and non-electrical products used in the ongoing maintenance and repair of equipment used in production processes. These products are also used for facility upkeep in manufacturing, commercial, institutional, and other operations. In addition, through acquisitions, we have expanded our safety products, personal protection safety equipment, first aid supplies, and OSHA compliance categories to complement the industrial MRO product lines.
Expand International Operations. We seek to capitalize on existing and emerging international market opportunities through the expansion of our global product and service platforms. We follow large existing global customers into international markets, extending our procurement outsourcing, integrated supply programs and supplier relationships. Once established, we also seek to develop new business opportunities in these markets. We believe this strategy of working with well-developed customer and supplier relationships significantly reduces risk and provides the opportunity to establish profitable business. Our priorities are focused on global vertical markets including energy, mining and metals, manufacturing, and infrastructure, as well as key product categories such as communications and security.
Grow Our Communications Products Position. Over the last several years, there has been a convergence of electrical and data communications contractors. Our ability to provide both electrical and communications products and services as well as automation, electromechanical, non-electrical MRO, physical security and utility products has presented cross selling opportunities across WESCO. Communications products are in continual demand due to network upgrades, low voltage security investments, data center upgrades and increasing broadband and telecommunications usage.
Grow Lighting System and Sustainability Sales. Lighting applications are undergoing significant innovation, driven by energy efficiency and sustainability trends. We have expanded our sales team and marketing initiatives and increased our presence and customer base with recent acquisitions. We expect to continue to add product and service offerings to provide lighting and energy-saving solutions.
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. Since 2010, we have made fourteen acquisitions that have helped us broaden and strengthen our product and services portfolio, increase our customer base, and provide an important source of talent.
We believe that the highly fragmented nature of the electrical and industrial distribution industry will continue to provide acquisition opportunities.
Drive Operational Excellence. LEAN continuous improvement is a set of company-wide strategic initiatives to increase efficiency and effectiveness across the entire business enterprise, including sales, operations and administrative processes. The basic principles behind LEAN are to systematically identify and implement improvements through simplification, elimination of waste and reduction in errors. We apply LEAN in our distribution environment, and develop and deploy numerous initiatives through the Kaizen approach targeting improvements in sales, margin, warehouse operations, transportation, purchasing, working 
3

capital management and administrative processes. Our objective is to continue to implement LEAN initiatives across our business enterprise and to extend LEAN services to our customers and suppliers.
Manage Our Talent. We seek to develop a distinct competitive advantage through talent management and employee engagement and development. We believe our ability to attract, develop and retain diverse human capital is imperative to ongoing business success. We improve workforce capability through various programs and processes that identify, recruit, develop and promote our talent base. Significant enhancements in these programs have been made over the last several years, and we expect to continue to refine and enhance these programs in the future.

Competitive Strengths
As a leading electrical distributor in a highly fragmented North American market, we compete directly with global, national, regional, and local distributors of electrical and other industrial supplies, along with buying groups formed by smaller distributors. Competition is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities and price. We believe that our market leadership, broad product offering, value-added services, technical expertise, extensive distribution network and low-cost operator status provide distinct competitive advantages.
Market Leadership. Our ability to manage complex global supply chains, and multi-site facility maintenance programs and construction projects, which require special sourcing, technical advice, logistical support and locally based service, has enabled us to establish a strong presence in the competitive and fragmented North American electrical distribution market.
Broad Product Offering and Value-added Services. We provide a wide range of products, services, and procurement solutions, which draw on our product knowledge, supply and logistics expertise, system capabilities and supplier relationships to enable our customers to maximize productivity, minimize waste, improve efficiencies, reduce costs and enhance safety. Our broad product offering and stable source of supply enables us to consistently meet customers’ wide-ranging capital project, MRO and OEM requirements.
Extensive Distribution Network. We operate approximately 500 geographically dispersed branch locations and ten distribution centers (six in the United States and four in Canada). Our distribution centers add value for our customers, suppliers, and branches through the combination of a broad and deep selection of inventory, online ordering and next-day shipment capabilities, and central order handling and fulfillment. Our distribution center network reduces the lead time and cost of supply chain activities through its automated replenishment and warehouse management system, and provides economies of scale in purchasing, inventory management, administration and transportation. This extensive network, which would be difficult and expensive to replicate, allows us to:

• | Enhance local customer service, technical support and sales coverage;


• | Tailor individual branch products and services to local customer needs, and


• | Offer multi-site distribution capabilities to large customers and global accounts.

Low-Cost Operator. Our competitiveness has been enhanced by our consistent favorable operating cost position, which is based on the use of LEAN, strategically-located distribution centers, and purchasing economies of scale. As a result of these and other factors, we believe our operating costs as a percentage of sales has historically been one of the lowest in our industry. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for 2017 were 14.3%.

Environmental Matters
Our facilities and operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations may impose strict, joint and several liabilities on certain persons for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated properties. These persons may include former, current or future owners or operators of properties and persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Our owned and leased real property may give rise to such investigation, remediation and monitoring liabilities under environmental laws.
