ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1997 as a mall-based, experiential specialty retailer where children and their families could create their own stuffed animals. Over the last nearly 25 years, Build-A-Bear has become a brand with high consumer awareness and positive affinity with over 200 million furry friends having been made by our guests around the world. The Company has leveraged, and expects to continue to leverage, its brand strength to strategically evolve its brick-and-mortar retail footprint beyond traditional malls with a versatile range of formats and locations including tourist destinations; to extend into international markets primarily via a franchise model; and to broaden its consumer base beyond children by adding teens and adults with entertainment/sports licensing, collectible and gifting offerings. The Company has also significantly advanced its digital transformation which is enabling meaningful growth in its e-commerce and omnichannel business primarily via opportunities related to Build-A-Bear’s pop-culture and multi-generational appeal; the advancement of an elevated consumer loyalty program with the goal of capturing first party data, expanding multi-channel shopping and driving lifetime value; the development of robust digital marketing programs and content capabilities with industry-leading partners.
 
As of January 29, 2022, we operated 346 corporately-managed locations, including 305 stores in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, 41 stores in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Ireland, 61 locations operated through our "third-party retail" model in which we sell our products on a wholesale basis to other companies that then in turn execute our retail experience, and had 72 franchised stores operating internationally, all under the Build-A-Bear Workshop brand. In addition to our stores, we sold product on our company-owned e-commerce sites, third-party marketplaces and franchisee sites and through retailer’s wholesale agreements.
 
Select corporately-managed, franchised, and third-party retail locations were temporarily closed due to pandemic-related government mandates as well as our internal COVID management policies at various times throughout fiscal 2021, primarily in the U.K. and Canada.
 
COVID Pandemic Update
 
At the beginning of fiscal 2021, our U.S. store portfolio was open and operating while our stores in the U.K, Ireland and Canada remained temporarily closed. In April 2021, stores in the U.K. reopened as the government lifted lockdown restrictions resulting in essentially all of our stores operating at the end of the 2021 first fiscal quarter with the remaining stores in the U.K. and Ireland opening in the second fiscal quarter thereby ending that period with all stores open in those geographies. The majority of our Canadian stores remained temporarily closed at the beginning of the second quarter with the majority reopening in June 2021 and with all stores ending that period open. Our year-over-year results discussed below were impacted by prior year store closures and operating hour reductions as a result of the pandemic. Throughout the fiscal year, temporary, unplanned store closures occurred due to COVID exposures on a limited basis, with one store temporarily closed as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year.
 
 The scope and nature of these impacts on our business and financial performance are discussed in more detail throughout this report, including within Item 1. "Business", Item 1A. "Risk Factors, Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", and the footnotes to our financial statements included in Item 15. "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules" below. 
 
Segments and Geographic Areas
 
Our business is conducted through three reportable segments consisting of direct-to-consumer (“DTC”), commercial, and international franchising. Our reportable segments are primarily determined by the types of customers they serve and the types of products and services that they offer. Each reportable segment may operate in many geographic areas. Financial information related to our segments and the geographic areas in which we operate is contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” See Note 15 — Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding sales, results of operations and identifiable assets of the Company by business segment and by geographic area.

Description of Operations
 
Build-A-Bear Workshop offers interactive entertainment experiences via both physical and e-commerce engagement, targeting a range of consumer segments and purchasing occasions through digitally-driven, diversified omnichannel capabilities. We operate a vertical retail channel with stores that feature a unique combination of experience and product in which guests can “make their own stuffed animals” by participating in the stuffing, fluffing, dressing, accessorizing and naming of their own teddy bears and other stuffed animals. We also operate e-commerce sites that focus on gift-giving, collectible merchandise and licensed products that appeal to consumers that have an affinity for characters from a range of entertainment, sports, art, and gaming properties. Our engaging digital purchasing experiences include our online “Bear-Builder”, the animated “Bear Builder 3D Workshop”, an age-gated adult-focused “Bear Cave” and the recently introduced “HeartBox” gift site. Our retail stores also act as “mini distribution centers” that provide efficient omnichannel support for our growing digital demand. The primary consumer target for our retail stores is families with children while our e-commerce sites focus on collectors and gift givers that are primarily tweens, teens and adults. We have also extended our business model by leveraging our brand strength and owned intellectual properties through the creation of engaging content for kids and adults while also offering products at wholesale and in non-plush consumer categories via outbound licensing agreements with leading manufacturers.
 
We seek to provide outstanding guest service and experiences across all channels and touch points including our stores, our e-commerce sites, our mobile sites and apps as well as traditional, digital and social media. We believe the hands-on and interactive nature of our stores, our personal service model and engaging digital shopping experiences result in guests forming an emotional connection with our brand which has multi-generational appeal that captures today’s zeitgeist including desire for experience, personalization and “DIY” while being recognized as trusted, giving, and a part of pop culture.
 
We believe there are opportunities to extend the reach and size of our diverse consumer segments through expanded products and licensed relationships, evolved experiences, and incremental occasions, partnerships, and marketing activities. We believe we can further develop our business by creating a continuous circle of engagement with expanded programs including outbound branded licensing and entertainment that drives retail performance and leverages our brand equity which may in turn positively impact other channels of distribution.
 
Operating Strategies
 
To support our overall strategy, we have evolved many aspects of our company in recent years ranging from an organizational re-structure to supply chain diversification to rebuilding our IT infrastructure. We believe the activities and investments that were initiated prior to the pandemic, and in many cases accelerated during the pandemic, particularly as it relates to our primary objective to comprehensively digitally transform the company, are the primary drivers of the positive performance that we delivered in fiscal 2021 including growth in total revenues and the highest profitability in our company’s history. We remain focused on the disciplined execution of our multi-year strategy to elevate and monetize our iconic brand, take advantage of the growing digital economy as well as advanced marketing capabilities and believe we are a fundamentally different company compared to the pre-COVID timeframe.
 
Our strategic priorities are centered primarily on three key areas:
 

• | Further acceleration of our digital transformation including content and entertainment initiatives. We have plans in place designed to increase repeat purchase rates and enhance engagement with the over 12 million opted-in first party data contacts including over 10 million active Build-A-Bear Bonus Club members. We expect to more effectively use our expanded digital capabilities and platforms to inform and drive marketing and content campaigns and deliver personalized experiences and sales messaging. We also plan to expand our addressable market by reaching beyond the core kid base and acquire new tween, teen, and adult consumers by offering unique affinity offerings and expanding purchase occasions. In addition, we plan to continue to utilize digital media, content and entertainment as marketing and brand-building tools to engage consumers and create value.

• | Continuing to leverage our expanded omnichannel capabilities while further evolving retail experiences and purchase occasions. With the vast majority of our U.S. stores profitable in fiscal 2021, we believe there is an opportunity to add up to 20 locations in the next two to three years through a combination of our corporately-managed and third-party retail models with an emphasis on tourist sites. We also plan to leverage our enhanced omnichannel options including Buy Online Ship From Store, Buy Online Pickup In Store and same day delivery through our relationship with Shipt to efficiently support fulfillment of our growing digital demand. This strategic use of hundreds of store locations as “mini distribution centers” significantly improves e-commerce fulfillment efficiency and throughput, decreases ship time (which is especially critical to minimize holiday cut-off days) and leverages available labor in our retail stores. We also re-introduced our in-store party offering after a nearly two-year hiatus due to COVID in March of 2022. In addition, 2022 marks the 25th anniversary since Build-A-Bear Workshop was founded and we plan to capitalize on the occasion to create interest, leverage nostalgia and drive incremental purchases.

• | Optimizing our solid financial position including a strong balance sheet to support our business and make strategic investments designed to drive further growth. We plan to maintain disciplined expense management particularly in light of recent inflationary pressures, wage increases and supply chain challenges. We are also focused on ongoing lease negotiations as we continue to evolve our real estate portfolio with new locations, formats and business models. In addition, we expect to continue to strategically manage our capital to support key initiatives and innovative developments designed to deliver long-term profitable growth while returning value to sharrholders. 

Merchandise Sourcing and Inventory Management
 
Our stores and e-commerce sites offer an extensive and coordinated selection of merchandise, including a wide range of different styles of plush products to be stuffed, pre-stuffed plush products, sounds and scents that can be added to the stuffed animals and a broad variety of clothing, shoes and accessories, as well as other brand appropriate toy and novelty items, sourced from multiple vendors primarily in China and Vietnam. Our plush products and clothing are produced from high quality, man-made materials or natural fibers, and the stuffing is made of a high-grade polyester fiber.
 
We believe we comply with governmental toy safety requirements specific to each country where there are Build-A-Bear Workshop stores. Specifically, we believe all of the products sold in our stores and through our e-commerce sites meet Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) requirements including the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) for children’s products. We also believe we comply with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM-F963), European Toy Safety Standards (EN71), China National Toy Standards (GB6675/GB5296.5), China Compulsory Certification (CCC), Australian/New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS 8124), Canadian Consumer Product Safety Act Toys Regulation (CCPSA), Chile Standard on Safety of Toys NCh 3251 and India Safety of Toys (IS:9873). Our products are tested through independent third-party testing labs for compliance with toy safety standards. Packaging and labels for each product indicate the age grading for the product and any special warnings in accordance with guidelines established by the CPSC or other applicable authority. We require our supplier factories to be compliant with the International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI) Ethical Toy Program certification or with other third-party social compliance programs. The ICTI Ethical Toy Program process is a social compliance program to promote ethical manufacturing in the form of fair labor treatment, as well as employee health and safety in the toy industry supply chain worldwide. In order to obtain this certification, each factory completes a rigorous evaluation performed by an accredited ICTI agent on an annual basis.
 
The average time from product conception to the arrival in stores is approximately 12 months, including approximately 90 to 120 days from the beginning of production to in-store delivery. Through an ongoing analysis of selling trends, we regularly update our product assortment by increasing quantities of productive styles and eliminating less productive styles. Our relationships with our vendors generally are on a purchase order basis without contractual obligation to provide adequate supply or acceptable pricing on a long-term basis.
 
As of January 29, 2022, our inventory balance was $71.8 million, an increase of $24.9 million compared to January 30, 2021. The majority of the increase was related to in-transit inventory due to strategically planned accelerated purchases used to partially mitigate inflationary and supply chain COVID-related pressure and anticipated continued increases in product and freight costs. While we are comfortable with the receipt flow, level, and composition of our inventory, we continue to manage our supply chain in an effort to mitigate logistics disruptions and delays in product shipments.

Distribution and Logistics
 
We own a 350,000 square-foot distribution center in Groveport, Ohio (near Columbus) that serves the majority of our stores in the U.S. and Canada. We also contract with a third-party warehouse in southern California to service our West Coast stores. The contract has a one-year term and is renewable. In Europe, we contract with a third-party distribution center in Selby, England under an agreement that ends in January 2025, to fulfill our store and e-commerce fulfillment needs. This agreement contains clauses that allow for termination if certain performance criteria are not met. In Asia, we contract with a third-party distribution center and office space in Shanghai, China, both of whose agreements end in April 2023.
 
Transportation from the warehouses to stores is managed by several third-party logistics providers. In the U.S., Canada and Europe, merchandise is shipped by a variety of distribution methods, depending on the store and seasonal inventory demand. Shipments from our distribution centers are scheduled throughout the week in order to smooth workflow, and stores are grouped together by shipping route to reduce freight costs. All items in our assortment are eligible for distribution, depending on allocation and fulfillment requirements, and we typically distribute merchandise and supplies to each store once every other week or once a week on a regular schedule, which allows us to consolidate shipments in order to reduce distribution and shipping costs. Back-up supplies, such as stuffing for the plush animals, are often stored in limited amounts at regional pool points.
 
During fiscal 2020, we introduced "Buy Online, Ship From Store" and "Buy Online, Pick Up In Store" for orders placed in the U.S. and "Click and Collect" for orders placed in the U.K. These programs allow our brick and mortar stores to operate essentially as mini distribution centers allowing us to leverage the geographic proximity of stores, available inventory and labor to fulfill e-commerce demand.
 
Employees 
 
As of January 29, 2022, we had approximately 1,000 full-time and 2,700 regular part-time employees in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland and China. The number of part-time employees at all locations fluctuates depending on our seasonal needs. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Competition
 
As our company has diversified and evolved, we view our competition through a number of categories. For our retail stores, we view the Build-A-Bear Workshop store experience as a distinctive combination of entertainment and retail with limited direct competition. We are aware of several small companies that operate “make your own” teddy bear and stuffed animal stores or kiosks in retail locations, but we believe none of those companies offer the breadth of assortment nor depth of experience or operate as a national or international retail company.
 
Since our signature products, teddy bears and other stuffed animals, are included in the toy category, we compete indirectly with a number of companies that sell plush products or premium children’s toys, including, but not limited to, Ty, Mattel, Hasbro, Lego, Ganz, and Steiff. We also compete with toy retailers including online and mass merchandisers such as Amazon, Walmart or Target as well as specialty stores such as The Entertainer Toy Shop, Smyths Toys Superstores and Hamleys.
 
As our gift-giving and affinity business has grown, our competitors include diverse retail and online companies such as Vermont Teddy Bear, Funko, or 1-800 Flowers. Since we sell a product that integrates merchandise and experience, we also view our competition as any company that competes for family time and entertainment dollars, such as movie theaters, amusement parks and arcades, other mall-based entertainment venues, party venues and online entertainment.
 
Intellectual Property and Trademarks 
 
We believe our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and similar intellectual property are critical to our success, and we intend, directly or indirectly, to maintain and protect these marks and, where applicable, license the intellectual property. Our patents do not expire until the years 2032 and 2033.

We have developed licensing and strategic relationships with leading retail and cultural organizations. We plan to continue to collaborate with companies that have strong, family-oriented brands and provide us with attractive marketing and merchandising opportunities. These relationships for specific products are generally reflected in contractual arrangements for limited terms that are terminable by either party upon specified notice. Specifically, we have key strategic relationships with select companies in which we feature their brands on products sold in our stores, including Disney®, NBCUniversal, Lucasfilm, Warner Bros., Pokémon, ViacomCBS, Nintendo, and major professional and collegiate sports along with other culturally relevant brands.
