Item 1. Business
Company Overview

Cosmos Holdings Inc. together with its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to collectively as “us”, “we”, or the “Company”) is an international pharmaceutical company with a proprietary line of nutraceuticals and distributor of branded and generic pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, over-the-counter (OTC) medications and medical devices through an extensive, established EU and UK distribution network. The Company identifies, acquires, develops and commercializes products that improve patients’ lives and outcomes. We have developed a global distribution platform which is currently expanding throughout Europe, Asia and North America. Currently, the Company has offices and distribution centers through its three wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Cosmos Holdings Inc., the parent company headquartered in Chicago, USA (ii) SkyPharm S.A., headquartered in Thessaloniki, Greece; (iii) Decahedron Ltd., head-quartered in Harlow, United Kingdom; and (iv) Cosmofarm S.A., headquartered in Athens, Greece. 

The Company’s cross-border pharmaceutical business serves wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and independent retail pharmacies across the EU through a network of two strategic distribution centers, one in Greece and one in the UK, as well as an additional warehousing facility. The Company focuses on leveraging its growing purchasing scale and supplier relationships to secure discounts and provide pharmaceuticals at reduced prices and on continuing to drive organic growth at attractive margins for its cross-border pharmaceutical wholesale business.

The Company operates in the business of full-line pharmaceutical wholesale distribution and serves approximately 1,500 independent retail pharmacies and 40 pharmaceutical wholesalers in Greece region by providing brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and nutraceuticals. We invest in technology to enhance safety, distribution and warehousing efficiency and reliability. Specifically, the Company operates a fully automated warehouse system with three robotic systems, two ROWA™ types and one A-frame type, that ensure 0% error selection rate, accelerate order fulfillment, and yield higher cost-efficiency in our distribution center. 

The Company regularly evaluates and undertakes strategic initiatives to expand its distribution reach, improve its profit margins, and strengthen its competitive position. Taking into consideration the growing demand of various vitamins and nutraceuticals, the Company entered the market with its own brand of nutraceuticals: Sky Premium Life® (SPL). Our current business has provided us with access to wholesalers both from the sourcing and the sales division of our wholesale business. We sell our products to vendors that supply us with pharmaceutical products as well as to our clients to whom we currently sell pharmaceutical products. We serve this demand by offering quality products to our existing network of wholesalers and pharmacies. Pharmacies are still the key channels for distribution and sales of nutraceuticals in the European market. The development and manufacturing of our own line is assigned to a related party which operates according to our specifications and GMP protocols. 

We make use of analytics and customer feedback from our EU-wide network of wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and independent retail pharmacies to identify and evaluate which nutraceutical product codes of the brand Sky Premium Life® to be developed, commercialized and added to our portfolio. We intend to continue to bring Sky Premium Life® products to market primarily through our existing network of over 160 pharmaceutical wholesale clients and vendors and approximately 100 independent retail pharmacies within the EU market. Moreover, we have penetrated several markets through digital sale channels. There is growing demand for vitamins and nutraceuticals and we are committed to developing quality products and creating enhanced customer value. 

We regularly evaluate acquisition targets that would allow us to expand our distribution reach and/or vertically integrate into the supply chain of pharmaceutical products that we currently distribute. We believe that the demand for reasonably-priced medicines, delivered on time and in the highest quality is set to increase in the years to come, as the population’s life expectancy increases. With our product portfolio of patented and non-patented medicines, we contribute to the optimization of efficient medicinal care, and thereby lowering cost for health insurance funds, companies, and patients. We also believe that the demand for non-prescription wellness products such as food and dietary supplements will continue to increase as individuals are increasingly supplementing their nutritional intake.

We believe the EU pharmaceutical import/export market will continue to grow in conjunction with the demand for nutritional products. We continue to encounter competition in the market as we grow. The competition comes in the form of level of service, reliability, and product quality. On the procurement side we continue to expand our vendor base. In order to minimize business risks, we diversify our sources of supply. We maintain our high-quality standards by carefully selecting and qualifying our suppliers as well as actively ensuring that our suppliers meet our standard of quality control on an ongoing basis.

Business Environment

The Company conducts its business within the pharmaceutical and the healthcare industry and is active in branded pharmaceuticals, generics and nutraceutical product markets. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is subject to comprehensive government regulations. Many factors may significantly affect the Company’s sales of its products, including, but not limited to, efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.

Generic medicines are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of branded pharmaceutical products and are generally marketed under their generic (chemical) names rather than by brand names. Typically, a generic drug may not be marketed until the expiration of applicable patent(s) on the corresponding branded product, unless a resolution of patent litigation results in an earlier opportunity to enter the market. Generic drugs are the same as branded products in dosage form, safety, efficacy, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use, but they are sold generally at prices below those of the corresponding branded products. Generic drugs provide a cost-effective alternative for consumers, while maintaining the same high quality, efficacy, safety profile, purity and stability of the branded product.

The Company also conducts its business within the global nutraceuticals market with our own brand which considered to be highly qualitative and competitive. Nutraceuticals are defined as products that contain at least one dietary ingredient within them and can be consumed orally. Some of the purposes of nutraceuticals are used for immune system defense, energy, stress, bones and joints, The global nutraceutical market has shown rise for demand and growth within the last several years. The global market is driven by the rising popularity of sports-based performance enhancement supplements and the focus on preventive healthcare measures. The COVID-19 pandemic has also driven the global market to a high demand for immunity boosting nutraceutical products. 

Corporate Strategy

The main strategy initiative is focused on continuing our progress in becoming a global pharmaceutical wholesale and import/export company through the development of a lean and efficient operating model, as well as, to expand our portfolio of our own branded nutraceutical products, grow our customer base and achieve our growth stabilization in this new market and gain an adequate size in the global nutraceuticals market. We are committed to serving our customers while continuing to innovate and provide products that make a difference in the lives of individuals. We strive to maximize our shareholders’ value by adapting to market realities and customer needs. Our strategy involves building a multinational network or wholesalers, distributors, and pharmacies and simultaneously continuing to expand the portfolio of products that we distribute to that network.

We are committed to driving organic growth at attractive margins by improving execution, optimizing cash flow and leveraging our strong market position, while maintaining a streamlined cost structure throughout each of our businesses. We continue to further align our organization to our customers’ needs in a more seamless and unified way, while supporting corporate strategy and accelerating growth. Implementing this disciplined, focused strategy has allowed us to significantly expand our business, and we believe we are well-positioned to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following key elements of our business:


· | Optimize and Grow Our Pharmaceutical Sourcing and Distribution Businesses. We believe we are well-positioned in size and market breadth to continue to grow our trading businesses of pharmaceutical products as we invest to improve our operating and capital efficiencies through further automated systems. Sourcing and distribution, including specialty pharmaceuticals, anchors our growth and position in the pharmaceutical supply channel as we provide superior services and deliver value-added products, which improve the efficiency and competitiveness of healthcare providers, thus allowing the pharmaceutical supply channel to better deliver healthcare to patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Product Expansion of Branded Pharmaceuticals: Branded pharmaceutical products are the primary product category that we distribute, import and export. We constantly evaluate product availability, pricing, demand trends, and patent expirations to maximize our performance. As the patents for branded products near expiration, the generic equivalents enter the marketplace and the demand for those branded products start to decrease. We monitor these cycles closely and always look to find value in pricing fluctuations caused by the patent expirations as the generic equivalents enter the market. 


5


· | Geographic Expansion of Generic Pharmaceuticals: Generic pharmaceutical products are the secondary product category that we import and export. We apply the same discipline to generics that we do to the branded. We evaluate the demand and supply dynamics of branded products as their patents expire. This insight sheds light on the demand for generic products that take their place. Understanding the historical and market specific characteristics of generic product demand provides insight that we use to give guidance to our vendors that source our generic drug exports. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Nutraceuticals & Health Products: The industry of nutraceuticals is a highly promising market that offers high margins. We are always looking to expand the portfolio of products along with an increase of point of sales coverage level. We also convenience our customers by providing them a larger portfolio of products that they can source from a single vendor. In addition to being wholesalers for nutraceuticals and related products we also created our own brand of products to sell to our current customer base. Our wholesale business gives insight to what products are in demand and we communicate with our customer base to identify which products to develop. Our own branded nutraceuticals carry significantly higher margins than simply serving as a wholesaler for other brands.
· | Research & Development: We are committed to strategic R&D across each business unit with a particular focus for nutraceuticals with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined regulatory pathways. We are constantly evaluating the demand for nutraceuticals in the markets that we currently distribute pharmaceutical products to. This research and analysis determine which nutritional supplements we choose to develop as well as their formulations. This approach maximizes the probability of successfully competing with other brands in the marketplace. 
· | Acquisitions: We regularly evaluate acquisition targets that would allow us to expand our distribution reach and/or vertically integrate into the supply chain of the products that we currently distribute. In addition to focusing on organic growth drivers, we are also actively pursuing accretive acquisitions that offer long-term revenue growth, margin expansion through synergies, and the ability to maintain a flexible capital structure. 
· | Clientele Expansion of Direct to Pharmacy Wholesale Network: We are aiming to expand the full-line wholesale distribution business through acquisitions. By expanding our pharmaceutical distribution business, we expect to have a better ability to source more branded and generic products directly from manufacturers and sell our vitamins, nutraceuticals and cosmetic products directly to pharmacies for better prices. We expect this expansion to increase our sales and profit margins as we vertically integrate into the supply chain. 


To successfully execute our corporate strategy, we believe that the Company must adopt, incorporate and maintain the aforementioned core strengths, although no assurances can be made that the Company will be able to effectively implement these strategies. 

Products & Services

Products

The current principal activity of the Company is the creation, development and trading of its own proprietary branded nutraceutical products line “Sky Premium Life®”. The Company’s portfolio currently includes 75 product codes including vitamins, minerals and other herbal extracts used for health prevention and care needs. We also use our subsidiaries, as a distribution centers for SPL in order to penetrate UK and EU markets. However, the leading activity of Decahedron is the trading of branded and generic pharmaceutical products and medicines across the UK and European Union member states. We also buy from pharmacies and other wholesale pharmaceutical companies and resell these products to other EU countries or in the UK. We purchase excess inventories at a discount from wholesalers and export pharmaceutical product codes to EU member states capturing contract price differentials in the process. The Company only purchases stock with purchase orders at hand, limiting inventory risk. EU countries have put into force new legal frameworks and mandates that boost the parallel trade market in order to deflate healthcare pricing across the region.

Services

The principal activity of our services is the distribution of a full range of branded pharmaceutical products, over-the-counter products, cosmetics, nursery, and nutraceutical products to pharmacies across Greece. We utilize the latest technology in pharmaceutical storage and retrieval systems to ensure the quality and accuracy of its distribution. Our facility utilizes ROWA™ (German pharmacy robotics) technologies to automate our procurement, a German fully automated warehouse system, inventory management, and order execution. Therefore, we achieve a zero-error rate, faster order picking, automated order picking process, higher cost-efficiency. We stay in the forefront of quality assurance and accuracy by investing in the most innovative machinery and software available to pharmaceutical distributors. Our company supports all its customers with special product offerings, seasonal products, and all the top brands and trending products.

We believe that the entire aforementioned product life cycle would take approximately six weeks to two months, from the demand list to the payment for the shipment.

Distribution and Marketing

The majority of our products are represented directly and indirectly through a dedicated sales force team. Our sales force targets mainly wholesale distributors and other healthcare providers. We sell our products principally through independent wholesale distributors, but we also sell directly to other healthcare providers such as; clinics, government agencies, independent retail and specialty pharmacies and independent specialty distributors. Customer service representatives are centralized in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner. We seek to motivate and provide incentives to our sales force team by offering high quality products and providing them with product support, training seminars, sales convention and financial incentives.

Our products in Europe and in the UK are shipped directly from our warehouse facilities and in foreign markets we have contracted third-parties to distribute our products. 

We are formulating a broader and more diversified pharmaceutical product portfolio and a greater selection of targets for potential development. We target products with limited competition for reasons such as trading complexity or the market size, which make our pharmaceutical products a key growth driver of our portfolio and complementary to other product offerings.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Proprietary Property

We have developed or acquired various proprietary pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products, nutraceutical products licenses, wholesale licenses, processes, software, and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers.

At present, besides the above licenses we do not have any intellectual property or other licenses, including, but not limited to, patents, trademarks, franchises, concessions, and royalty agreements or other proprietary interests.

We have obtained trademark registrations for “Sky Premium Life®”, and related logos for all of our “Sky Premium Life®” products product lines. We hold trademark registrations in Europe. 

We rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties to protect, among other things, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that other third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and other intellectual property

Product Insurance

We have insurance in place for our warehouses and the products in stock against any damage or theft, but we do not insure our products after the sale, since we are working under an Ex-works policy, and thus our clients are responsible for the transportation and the insurance of the products against any damage. In the future, we will continue to reevaluate our decision and may purchase product liability insurance to cover some of or all of our product liability risk.
Customers 

Through our subsidiaries, we primarily sell pharmaceutical products directly to pharmacies and a limited number of large wholesale drug distributors who, in turn, supply-sell the products to other wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, and governmental agencies across the European Union member state. Total revenues from the customers that accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

 | 2021 | | | 2020
------------+------+-------+---+-----
Medihelm SA | | 15.33 | % | | 14.82 | %

No other customer generated over 10% of our total revenue.

We have a diverse customer base that includes wholesalers and retail healthcare providers. We make a significant amount of our sales to a relatively small number of pharmaceutical wholesalers. These customers represent an essential part of the distribution chain of our products. Pharmaceutical wholesalers have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, significant consolidation in a worldwide basis. This consolidation resulted in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and consequently increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business. 

Geographic Markets

All of our revenues are generated from operations in the European Union and UK, or otherwise earned outside the U.S. All of our foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including price and currency exchange controls, fluctuations in the relative values of currencies, political and economic instability and restrictive governmental actions including. Our geographical market sales distribution of our total consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

 | 2021 | | | 2020
------------+------+--------+---+-----
Greece | | 98.80 | % | | 92.31 | %
Germany | | 0.02 | % | | 2.51 | %
UK | | 0.82 | % | | 3.34 | %
Netherlands | | 0 | % | | 0.34 | %
Ireland | | 0 | % | | 0.07 | %
Libya | | 0 | % | | 0.08 | %
Poland | | 0 | % | | 0.05 | %
Italy | | 0.03 | % | | 0.14 | %
France | | 0 | % | | 0.03 | %
Denmark | | 0.10 | % | | 0.97 | %
Croatia | | 0.03 | % | | 0.04 | %
Jordan | | 0 | % | | 0.05 | %
Cyprus | | 0.20 | % | | 0.07 | %
Total | | 100.00 | % | | 100.00 | %



We currently sell the products to wholesalers through our own sales force. We do not sell directly to large drug store chains or through distributors in countries where we do not have our own sales staff. As part of our sales marketing and promotion program, we use direct advertising, direct mailings, trading techniques, direct and personal contacts, exhibition of products at medical conventions and sponsor medical education symposia. 

Competition

Our pharmaceutical businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our trading of pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. The means of competition vary across product categories and business groups, demonstrating that the value of our trading products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses.

9


Our competitors include other trading companies, smaller companies, with generic drug and consumer healthcare products. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our trading pharmaceutical products.

Our competitive position in pharmaceutical sector is affected by several factors including among others, the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors’ promotional resources; customer acceptance; product quality; our and our competitors’ introduction of new products, ingredients, claims, dosage forms, or other forms of innovation; and pricing, regulatory and legislative matters (such as product labeling, patient access and prescription). 

The branded pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Our products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the EU territory and internationally as well. Competitors include many of the major brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. 

In the generic pharmaceutical market, we might face intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand name pharmaceutical companies, existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs.

By specializing in high barrier to entry products, we endeavor to market more profitable and longer-lived products relative to commodity generic products. We believe that our competitive advantages include our integrated team-based approach to product development that combines our formulation, regulatory, legal and commercial capabilities; our ability to introduce new generic equivalents for brand-name drugs; our ability to meet customer expectations; and the breadth of our existing generic product portfolio offering.

Newly introduced generic products with limited or no other generic competition typically garner higher prices. At the expiration of the exclusivity period, other generic distributors may enter the market, resulting in a significant price decline for the drug. Consequently, the maintenance of profitable operations in generic pharmaceuticals depends, in part, on our ability to select, develop and launch new generic products in a timely and cost-efficient manner and to maintain efficient, high quality business capabilities.

We compete in the nutritional industry with our own branded nutraceutical products against companies that sell through retail stores, as well as against other direct selling companies. We compete against manufacturers and retailers of nutraceutical products which are distributed through supermarkets, drug stores, health food stores, vitamin outlets and mass market retailers, among others. We believe that the principal components of competition in nutraceutical products are expertise and service, high product quality, diversification and differentiation, price and brand recognition. 

Operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to take measures to evaluate, adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs. We also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our functions, including efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products. 

Information Systems 

The Company operates its full-service wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in Europe on one primary enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system that provides for, among other things, electronic order entry by customers, invoice preparation and purchasing, and inventory tracking. We are currently making significant investments to enhance and upgrade the ERP system. 

Additionally, we are improving our entity-wide infrastructure environment to drive efficiency, capabilities, and speed to market. We will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology. For example, in an effort to comply with future pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements we have made significant investments in our secure supply chain information systems.

The Company processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders, invoices, and payments electronically. However, it continues to make substantial investments to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers. The Company has integrated warehouse operating system, which are used to manage the majority of transactional volume. The warehouse operating system has improved the distribution services productivity and operating leverage.

Government Regulations

Government authorities in the EU and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, packaging, advertising and promotion, storage, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products. As such, our branded pharmaceutical products and the generic product candidates are subject to extensive regulation both before and after approval. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a pharmaceutical product. 

Our business is mainly the trading of branded and generic pharmaceutical products and medicines within the EU member states. In order to be able to operate our business, we need to comply with EU regulations, as well as EU member states regulations that govern various operations of our business. The most important government regulation that applies to our business is the granting to our companies SkyPharm and Decahedron of the Authorization for Wholesale Distribution of Medicinal Products for human use. In order for this Authorization to be granted the companies need to always comply with certain Good Distribution Practices (“GDP”) that mainly assure the proper storage, handling, distribution and trade of the pharmaceutical products.

As of July 22, 2015, the Hellenic Ministry of Health and more specifically the National Organization for Medicines granted to SkyPharm a license for the wholesale of pharmaceutical products for human use. The license is valid for a period of five years and pursuant to the EU directive of (2013/C343/02). SkyPharm is subject to the Guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices of the European Union (the “Good Distribution Practices”) for the sale and distribution of medical products for human use. The Company submitted its application for renewal one month before the license expiration to the Hellenic Republic National Organization, but according to the EMA (eudragmdp.ema.europa.eu/inspections/view/wda/WDAHomePage.xhtml): “Due to the restrictions caused by COVID-19, the period of validity of MIA’s, WDA’s, GMP and GDP certificates is automatically extended until the end of 2021. On-site inspections will resume as soon as there is a consensus that the period of the public health crisis has passed. The clarifying remark section of individual MIA’s, WDA’s, GMP and GDP certificates will indicate any exceptions. Competent authorities reserve the right to inspect a manufacturing site should the need arise.” The Company is now focused on its own proprietary nutraceuticals line SPL and therefore is not subject to the Guidelines of the Good Distribution Practice of Medicinal Products for Human Use. The Company has not submitted any renewal of the license and any potential needs for such services can be provided by the other subsidiaries which are subject to the Guidelines of the Good Distribution Practice of Medicinal Products for Human Use and their licenses are valid.

Decahedron received its Wholesale Distribution Authorization for human use on February 5, 2021, from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) in accordance with Regulation 18 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) and it is subject to the provisions of those Regulations and the Medicines Act 1971. This License will continue to remain in force from the date of issue by the Licensing Authority unless cancelled, suspended, revoked or varied as to the period of its validity or relinquished by the authorization holder.

Cosmofarm received its Wholesale Distribution Authorization for human use on February 15, 2019, from the National Organization for Medicines. The license is valid for a period of five years and pursuant to the EU directive of (2013/C343/01). Also, Cosmofarm was granted with GDP certificate on November 11, 2019.

Our subsidiaries are ISO 9001 certified for a management system for the trade and distribution of pharmaceuticals. As part of the certification process by the International Organization for Standardization, we need to be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) adopted by the European Union in May 2018. GDPR applies to the processing of personal data of persons in the EU by a controller or processor.

Distribution and Equity Agreement

On March 19, 2018, the Company entered into a Distribution and Equity Acquisition Agreement (the “Distribution and Equity Acquisition Agreement”) with Marathon Global Inc. (“Marathon”), a company incorporated in the Province of Ontario, Canada. Marathon was formed to be a global supplier of Cannabis, cannabidiol (“CBD”) and/or any Cannabis Extract products, extracts, ancillaries and derivatives (collectively, the “Products”). The Company was appointed the exclusive distributor of the Products initially throughout Europe and on a non-exclusive basis wherever else lawfully permitted. The Company has no present intention to distribute any Products under this Agreement in the United States or otherwise participate in cannabis operations in the United States. The Company intends to await further clarification from the U.S. Government on cannabis regulation prior to determining whether to enter the domestic market.

The Distribution and Equity Acquisition Agreement is to remain in effect indefinitely unless Marathon fails to provide Market Competitive (as defined) product pricing and Marathon has not become profitable within five (5) years of the agreement. The transaction closed on May 22, 2018 after the due diligence period, following which the Company received: (a) a 33 1/3% equity interest or 5 million shares in Marathon as partial consideration for the Company’s distribution services; and (b) received cash of CAD $2,000,000, subject to repayment in Common Shares of the Company if it fails to meet certain performance milestones.

We intend to continue our efforts to build and expand this team as we grow our business. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to retain any additional persons.
