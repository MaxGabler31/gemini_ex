Item 1. Business
Overview
Progress offers the leading platform for developing and deploying mission-critical business applications. Progress empowers enterprises and independent software vendors (ISVs) to build and deliver cognitive-first applications that harness big data to derive business insights and competitive advantage. Progress offers leading technologies for easily building powerful user interfaces across any type of device, a reliable, scalable and secure backend platform to deploy modern applications, leading data connectivity to all sources, and award-winning predictive analytics that brings the power of machine learning to any organization. Over 1,700 ISVs, 100,000 enterprise customers, and 2 million developers rely on Progress to power their applications.
Our products are generally sold as perpetual licenses, but certain products also use term licensing models and our cloud-based offerings use a subscription based model. More than half of our worldwide license revenue is realized through relationships with indirect channel partners, principally application partners and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Application partners are ISVs that develop and market applications using our technology and resell our products in conjunction with sales of their own products that incorporate our technology. OEMs are companies that embed our products into their own software products or devices.
We operate in North America and Latin America (the Americas); Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and the Asia Pacific region, through local subsidiaries as well as independent distributors.
Fiscal Year 2017 Highlights
Beginning in late October 2016, with the appointment of Yogesh Gupta as our new Chief Executive Officer, our Board of Directors and executive management team undertook a comprehensive review of our strategy and operations, including our expectations for fiscal year 2017 results. 
On January 16, 2017, we announced a new strategic plan highlighted by a new product strategy and a streamlined operating approach with a tighter focus on areas of strength to more efficiently drive revenue. The key tenets of the new strategic plan are as follows:

• | Streamlined Operating Approach. In fiscal year 2017, we adapted our organization and operating principles to focus primarily on customer and partner retention and success for many of our core products. For selected products that have new customer acquisition potential, we also strengthened our demand generation and high volume, low touch e-commerce capabilities. 


• | New Product Strategy. As part of the new strategic plan, we undertook a new product strategy to provide the platform and tools enterprises need to build next generation applications that drive their businesses, known as “Cognitive Applications.” We offer this platform to both new customers and partners as well as our existing OpenEdge partner and customer ecosystems. Our platform for Cognitive Applications makes it easy for developers to build machine learning into their applications, and includes:

◦ | Our leading UI development tools, which enable organizations to easily build engaging user interfaces for any device or front end;


◦ | Our NativeScript offering, which allows developers to use JavaScript to build native applications across multiple mobile platforms;


◦ | A mission-critical back-end-as-a-service platform that runs on any cloud, is secure, high-performing, and highly-scalable while supporting all modern user interfaces;


◦ | Automated and intuitive machine learning capabilities for accelerating the creation and delivery of Cognitive Applications;


◦ | Our data connectivity and integration capabilities; and


◦ | Our business logic and rules capabilities.


• | Restructuring. With the adoption of our new product strategy, we discontinued our investment in our Digital Factory strategy and re-aligned our resources consistent with our core operating approach. To that end, during fiscal year 2017, we implemented restructuring efforts including the consolidation of facilities, implementation of a simplified organizational structure and a reduction of marketing and other external expenses. In addition, we reduced headcount by over 400 employees, totaling over 20% of our workforce. We reduced our full year expenses by over $30 million by the end of fiscal year 2017. 

DataRPM Acquisition
On March 1, 2017, we acquired DataRPM for an aggregate sum of $30.0 million. DataRPM is a leader in cognitive predictive maintenance for the industrial IoT (IIoT) market. This acquisition is a key part of the Company's strategy to provide the best platform to build and deliver cognitive-first applications.
Kinvey Acquisition
On June 1, 2017, we acquired Kinvey for an aggregate sum of $49.2 million. Kinvey is the leading Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider and allows developers to set up, use, and operate a cloud backend for any native, hybrid, web, or IoT app built using any development tools. This acquisition, in combination with our existing technologies, enables us to offer the premier platform for building and delivering cognitive business applications.
Share Repurchase Authorization
In September 2017, our Board of Directors increased our total share repurchase authorization to $250.0 million. In fiscal year 2017, we repurchased and retired 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $73.9 million. As of November 30, 2017, there is $220.0 million remaining under this current authorization. We expect to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018.
Dividend Declaration
On September 27, 2016, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock to Progress shareholders. On September 6, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.14 per share of common stock. We have declared aggregate per share quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.515 and $0.125 for the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We have paid aggregate cash dividends totaling $24.1 million and $0 for the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Product Development
Most of our products have been developed by our internal product development staff or the internal staffs of acquired companies. We believe that the features and performance of our products are competitive with those of other available development and deployment tools and that none of the current versions of our products are approaching obsolescence. However, we believe that significant investments in new product development and continuing enhancements of our current products will be required for us to maintain our competitive position.
As of November 30, 2017, we have four primary development offices in North America, two primary development offices in India and one primary development office in EMEA. We spent $77.0 million, $88.6 million, and $88.3 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on product development, including capitalized software development costs.
Customers
We market our products globally through several channels: directly to end users and indirectly to application partners (or ISVs), OEMs, and system integrators. Sales of our solutions and products through our direct sales force have historically been to business managers or IT managers in corporations and governmental agencies. We also target developers who create business applications, from individuals to teams, within enterprises of all sizes.
We also market our products through indirect channels, primarily application partners and OEMs who embed our products as part of an integrated solution. We use international distributors in certain locations where we do not have a direct presence or where it is more economically feasible for us to do so. More than half of our license revenues are derived from indirect channels.

Application Partners
Our application partners cover a broad range of markets, offer an extensive library of business applications and are a source of follow-on revenue. We have kept entry costs, consisting primarily of the initial purchase of development licenses, low to encourage a wide variety of application partners to build applications. If an application partner succeeds in marketing its applications, we obtain follow-on revenue as the application partner licenses our deployment products to allow its application to be installed and used by customers. In recent years, a significantly increasing amount of our revenue from application partners has been generated from subscriptions to application partners who have chosen to enable their business applications under a SaaS platform.
Original Equipment Manufacturers
We enter into arrangements with OEMs in which the OEM embeds our products into its solutions, typically either software or technology devices. OEMs typically license the right to embed our products into their solutions and distribute those solutions for initial terms ranging from one to three years. Historically, most of our OEMs have renewed their agreements upon the expiration of the initial term. However, we are not assured that they will continue to renew in the future.
No single customer has accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in any of our last three fiscal years.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products and solutions through our direct sales force and indirect channel partners. We have sold our products and solutions to enterprises in over 180 countries. Our sales and field marketing groups are organized primarily by region. We operate by region in North America, Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. We believe this structure allows us to maintain direct contact with our customers and support their diverse market requirements. Our international operations provide focused local sales, support and marketing efforts and are able to respond directly to changes in local conditions.
In addition to our direct sales efforts, we distribute our products through systems integrators, resellers, distributors, and OEM partners in the United States and internationally. Systems integrators typically have expertise in vertical or functional markets. In some cases, they resell our products, bundling them with their broader service offerings. In other cases, they refer sales opportunities for our products to our direct sales force. Distributors sublicense our products and provide service and support within their territories. OEMs embed portions of our technology in their product offerings.
Sales personnel are responsible for developing new direct end user accounts, recruiting new indirect channel partners and new independent distributors, managing existing channel partner relationships and servicing existing customers. We actively seek to avoid conflict between the sales efforts of our application partners and our own direct sales efforts. We use our inside sales team to enhance our direct sales efforts and to generate new business and follow-on business from existing customers.
Our marketing personnel conduct a variety of marketing engagement programs designed to create demand for our products, enhance the market readiness of our products, raise the general awareness of our company and our products and solutions, generate leads for the sales organization and promote our various products. These programs include press relations, analyst relations, investor relations, digital/web marketing, marketing communications, participation in trade shows and industry conferences, and production of sales and marketing literature. We also hold global events, as well as regional user events in various locations throughout the world.
Our sales and marketing efforts with respect to certain of our products, including DevTools, differ from our traditional sales and marketing efforts because the target markets are different. For these products, we have designed our marketing and sales model to be efficient for high volumes of lower-price transactions. Our marketing efforts focus on driving traffic to our websites and on generating high quality sales leads, in many cases, consisting of developer end users who download a free evaluation of our software. Our sales efforts then focus on converting these leads into paying customers through a high volume, short duration, sales process. Of particular importance to our target market, we enable our customers to buy our products in a manner convenient to them, whether by purchase order, online with a credit card or through our channel partners.

Customer Support
Our customer support staff provides telephone and Web-based support to end users, application developers and OEMs. Customers may purchase maintenance services entitling them to software updates, technical support and technical bulletins. Maintenance is generally not required with our products and is purchased at the customer's option. We provide support to customers primarily through our main regional customer support centers in Bedford, Massachusetts; Morrisville, North Carolina; Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Hyderabad, India; Melbourne, Australia; and Sofia, Bulgaria. Local technical support for specific products is provided in certain other countries as well.
Professional Services
Our global professional services organization delivers business solutions for customers through a combination of products, consulting and education. Our consulting organization offers project management, implementation services, custom development, programming and other services. Our consulting organization also provides services to Web-enable existing applications or to take advantage of the capabilities of new product releases. Our education organization offers numerous training options, from traditional instructor-led courses to advanced learning modules available via the web or on CDs.
Our services offerings include: application modernization; data management, managed database services; performance enhancements and tuning; and analytics/business intelligence. 
Competition
The computer software industry is intensely competitive. We experience significant competition from a variety of sources with respect to all of our products. Factors affecting competition in the markets we serve include product performance in complex applications, application solutions, vendor experience, ease of integration, price, training and support.
We compete in various markets with a number of entities, such as salesforce.com, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Software AG, RedHat, Inc., Pivotal Software, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation and other smaller firms. Many of these vendors offer platform-as-a-service (PaaS), application development, data integration and other tools in conjunction with their CRM, web services, operating systems and relational database management systems. We believe that IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation and Oracle Corporation currently dominate the relational database market. We do not believe that there is a dominant vendor in the other infrastructure software markets, including application development. Some of our competitors have greater financial, marketing or technical resources than we have and/or may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can. Increased competition could make it more difficult for us to maintain our revenue and market presence.
Copyrights, Trademarks, Patents and Licenses
We rely on a combination of contractual provisions and copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights in our products. We generally distribute our products under software license agreements that grant customers a perpetual nonexclusive license to use our products and contain terms and conditions prohibiting the unauthorized reproduction or transfer of our products. We also distribute our products through various channel partners, including application partners, OEMs and system integrators. We also license our products under term or subscription arrangements.  In addition, we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with employees, consultants and channel partners. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, there is no assurance that these measures will be successful.
We seek to protect the source code of our products as trade secrets and as unpublished copyrighted works. We hold numerous patents covering portions of our products. We also have several patent applications for some of our other product technologies. Where possible, we seek to obtain protection of our product names and service offerings through trademark registration and other similar procedures throughout the world.
We believe that due to the rapid pace of innovation within our industry, factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel are as important in establishing and maintaining a leadership position within the industry as are the various legal protections of our technology. In addition, we believe that the nature of our customers, the importance of our products to them and their need for continuing product support may reduce the risk of unauthorized reproduction, although no assurances can be made in this regard.
