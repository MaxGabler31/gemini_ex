Revenue and User Model

Gagfare plans that its revenue will be derived from online flight ticket booking and ticket issuance.

For each advance booking that user makes through the Gagfare’s state of the art book-now-pay-later solution, a non-refundable $2.00 booking fee is paid to Gagfare. The booking fee will not apply to the flight ticket payment at ticket issuance.

When user has decided to issue the booked flight plan, full payment for the tickets will be made for ticket issuance. Gagfare may still get a market ticket price margin from the ticket issuance transactions, depending on the type of ticket offering from the ticket source which the user has chosen.

Gagfare will also provide advertising spots on the web and mobile application platforms, for travel related businesses to advertise on the platforms, which will bring a stream of advertising income to the platform.

While the technology already developed and operational, Gagfare will later expand into the other ticketing markets, include travel packages, cruises, trains and buses, hotel rooms, theme parks, sports and even tickets, apply similar search, book and buy ticket business model and mechanisms which is already applied to flight tickets.
