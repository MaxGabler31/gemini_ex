Item 1. | Business

In this report, the words “we,” “our,” “us,” “CoStar” or the “Company” refer to CoStar Group, Inc. and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. This report also refers to our websites, but information contained on those sites is not part of this report.
CoStar Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, founded in 1987, is the number one provider of information, analytics and online marketplaces to the commercial real estate industry in the United States (“U.S.”) and United Kingdom (“U.K.”) based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available; have the largest research department in the industry; own and operate leading online marketplaces for commercial real estate and apartment listings in the U.S. based on the numbers of unique visitors and site visits per month; provide more information, analytics and marketing services than any of our competitors and believe that we generate more revenues than any of our commercial real estate information and online marketplace competitors. We created and compiled our standardized platform of information, analytics and online marketplace services where industry professionals and consumers of commercial real estate, including apartments, and the related business communities, can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently accessing and exchanging accurate and standardized real estate-related information. Our service offerings span all commercial property types, including office, retail, industrial, multifamily, commercial land, mixed-use and hospitality. We manage our business geographically in two operating segments, with our primary areas of measurement and decision-making being North America, which includes the U.S. and Canada, and International, which includes the U.K., Spain, Germany and France.
Strategy
Our strategy is to provide industry professionals and consumers of commercial real estate and apartments with critical knowledge to explore and complete transactions by offering the most comprehensive, timely and standardized information on commercial real estate and apartments and the right tools to be able to effectively utilize that information. Over time, we have expanded our services for commercial real estate information, analytics and online marketplaces in an effort to continue to meet the needs of the industry as it grows and evolves. We have also extended our offering of comprehensive commercial real estate information geographically to include the U.K., Canada, Spain, Germany and France, through acquisitions and internal growth and development. Information about CoStar’s revenues from, and long-lived assets and total assets located in, foreign countries is included in Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenues; net income (loss) before interest and other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”); and total assets and liabilities for each of our segments are set forth in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. Information about risks associated with our foreign operations is included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”
We deliver our commercial real estate information content to our U.S. customers primarily via an integrated suite of online service offerings that includes information about space available for lease, comparable sales information, information about properties for sale, tenant information, Internet marketing services, analytical capabilities, information for clients’ websites, information about industry professionals and their business relationships, data integration and industry news. We also operate complementary online marketplaces for commercial real estate listings and apartment rentals. We strive to cross-sell our services to our customers and to upsell services that may best suit their needs.
We have five flagship brands - CoStar®, LoopNet®, Apartments.comTM, BizBuySell® and LandsofAmericaTM. Our subscription-based services consist primarily of information, analytics and online marketplace services offered over the Internet to commercial real estate industry and related professionals. Our subscription-based information services consist primarily of CoStar Suite® services. CoStar Suite is sold as a platform of service offerings consisting of CoStar Property Professional®, CoStar COMPS Professional® and CoStar Tenant® and through our mobile application, CoStar Go®. CoStar Suite is our primary service offering in our North America and International operating segments. 
Our LoopNet subscription-based online marketplace enables commercial property owners, landlords, and real estate agents working on their behalf to list properties for sale or for lease and to submit detailed information about property listings. Commercial real estate agents, buyers and tenants use LoopNet extensively to search for available property listings that meet their criteria.

 Apartments.comTM is part of our network of apartment marketing sites, which also includes ApartmentFinder.comTM, ForRent.com®, ApartmentHomeLiving.comTM, WestsideRentals.com®, AFTER55.com®, CorporateHousing.comTM, ForRentUniversity.com® and Apartamentos.comTM, our apartment-listing site offered exclusively in Spanish. Our apartment marketing network of subscription-based services offers renters a searchable database of apartment listings and provides professional property management companies and landlords with an advertising destination. Our apartment marketing network draws on and leverages CoStar’s multifamily database, which contains detailed information on apartment properties. We designed the Apartments.com, ApartmentFinder.com and Apartamentos.com websites, which were launched in February 2015, December 2015 and February 2017, respectively, to meet renter preferences and demands, which we believe drives traffic to those sites and attract advertisers who prefer to advertise on heavily trafficked apartment websites. We acquired the ForRent.com, AFTER55.com, CorporateHousing.com and ForRentUniversity.com sites when we completed the acquisition of ForRent, a division of Dominion Enterprises, on February 21, 2018. Our network of apartment marketing sites provide a comprehensive selection of rentals, information on actual availabilities and rents, and in-depth data on neighborhoods, including restaurants, nightlife, history, schools and other facts important to renters. To help renters find the information that meets their needs, the sites also offer innovative search tools such as the PolygonTM Search tool, which allows renters to specifically define the area in which they want to find an apartment. Apartments.com and Apartamentos.com also offer Plan Commute tools, which allow renters to search property listings that meet their transportation needs. The Screening ProsTM is our online apartment leasing platform that includes tenant screening services, rental applications and payments processing and lease renewals. 
Our BizBuySell services, which include BizQuest®, provide an online marketplace for businesses for sale. Our LandsofAmerica services, which include LandAndFarm and LandWatch®, provide an online marketplace for rural lands for sale that is also accessible via our Land.com domain.
We provide market research, consulting and analysis for commercial real estate investors and lenders via our CoStar Portfolio Strategy and CoStar Suite service offerings; portfolio and debt analysis, management and reporting capabilities through our CoStar Investment Analysis and CoStar Risk Analytics service offerings; and real estate and lease management solutions, including lease administration and abstraction services, through our CoStar Real Estate Manager service offerings. We have created and are continually improving our standardized platform of information, analytics and online marketplaces where members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently accessing and exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information.
Our standardized platform includes the most comprehensive proprietary database in the industry; the largest research department in the industry; proprietary data collection, information management and quality control systems; a large in-house product development team; a broad suite of web-based information, analytics and online marketplace services; a large team of analysts and economists; and a large, diverse base of clients. Our database has been developed and enhanced for more than 30 years by a research department that makes thousands of daily database updates. In addition to our internal efforts to grow the database, we have obtained and assimilated approximately 106 proprietary databases. Our comprehensive commercial real estate database powers our information services, sources data used in our analytic services and provides content for most of our online marketplace services. Our ability to utilize the same commercial real estate information across our standardized platform creates efficiencies in operations and improves data for our customers. 
Our subscription-based services consist primarily of information, analytics, and online marketplace services offered over the Internet to commercial real estate industry and related professionals. Our services are typically distributed to our clients under subscription-based license agreements that renew automatically, a majority of which have a term of one year. Upon renewal, many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations. To encourage clients to use our services regularly, we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription-based services rather than charging fees based on actual system usage or number of paid clicks. Depending on the type of service, contract rates are generally based on the number of sites, number of users, organization size, the client's business focus, geography, the number and types of services to which a client subscribes, the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a client's advertised properties in the search results. Our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis, but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis.

Expansion and Growth
Acquisitions
We have continually expanded the geographical coverage of our existing information services and developed new information, analytics and online marketplace services. In addition to internal growth, we have grown our business through strategic acquisitions. Our more recent acquisitions include the June 1, 2015 acquisition of Network Communications, Inc. (“NCI”), including its Apartment Finder business (collectively referred to as “Apartment Finder”), to further support our expansion into the multifamily vertical. Apartment Finder provides lead generation, advertising, and Internet marketing solutions to property managers and owners through its main service, ApartmentFinder.com. On July 1, 2015, we acquired the assets of Belbex Corporate, S.L. (“Belbex”), a small commercial real estate information provider operating in Madrid, Spain. On May 3, 2016, we acquired Thomas Daily GmbH (“Thomas Daily”), a commercial real estate news and information provider operating in Freiburg, Germany. On January 31, 2017, we acquired Koa Lei, Inc. (doing business as Westside Rentals and now known as Westside Rentals, LLC), an online marketplace specializing in Southern California real estate rentals, and its affiliated entity Westside Credit Services, LLC, a provider of credit checks and tenant screening for landlords in the Southern California real estate rental market. On May 10, 2017, we added LandWatch.com to our network of land-dedicated sites through our acquisition of LandWatch. On July 18, 2017, we acquired The Screening Pros, LLC, an online apartment leasing platform that includes tenant screening services, rental applications and payments processing and lease renewals. Most recently, on February 21, 2018, we completed the acquisition of ForRent, a division of Dominion Enterprises, ForRent’s primary service is digital advertising through a network of four multifamily websites - which includes ForRent.com, AFTER55.com, CorporateHousing.com and ForRentUniversity.com. We plan to integrate, develop and cross-sell the services offered by ForRent. ForRent.com is expected to remain a distinct, complementary brand to Apartments.com, giving property managers and owners more exposure for their listings. 
Development and Expansion
We expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services, introduce new services, integrate and cross-sell existing services, and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research, sales and marketing organizations. We are committed to supporting and improving our information, news, analytic and online marketplace solutions. 
The launch of the Apartments.com website and the ApartmentFinder.com website in 2015 are examples of our software development efforts to improve existing services, introduce new services, and integrate and cross-sell existing services. We believe the improved sites, enhanced search capabilities, availability of information regarding real-time vacancies and our continued development and introduction of enhancements to our online apartment rental marketplaces have attracted more consumers, making the sites more attractive to property managers, which has also increased our cross-selling opportunities. In 2017, we launched Apartamentos.com, an apartment-listing site offered exclusively in Spanish and built and tailored to meet the needs of Spanish language households in the U.S., which is believed to represent approximately 20 percent of the U.S. renter population. We believe greater functionality makes our services valuable to an even broader audience and helps us increase sales of our services to brokers, banks, owners, institutional investors and other industry participants. We expect technology enhancements to drive continued revenue growth in 2018.
We evaluate potential changes to our service offerings from time to time in order to better align the services we offer with customers’ needs. Further, in some cases, when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry and client needs, we may decide to combine, shift focus from, de-emphasize, phase out, or eliminate a service that, among other things, overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer. In the event that we eliminate or phase out particular service offerings, we may experience reduced revenues and earnings. The decision to eliminate or phase out a service offering may also ultimately result in increased revenues and earnings from sales of other services we offer in lieu of the eliminated or phased out services. In 2017, we began to transition the LoopNet marketplace to a pure pay-to-list/free-to-search marketing site for commercial real estate, and to convert LoopNet information customers to higher value CoStar Suite information services.  We completed integrating the backend systems of the LoopNet and CoStar databases during the second half of 2017; the two services now share a unified database of information, creating operating efficiencies and improving the data available to our customers. We also introduced new enhancements on the CoStar homepage, including a Listing Manager feature that we believe will increase the quantity and quality of the listing information available by enabling brokers and other industry participants to load information directly into the integrated system.  In turn, we expect this feature will reduce the time and costs associated with researching and maintaining our comprehensive database of commercial real estate information. 
 We continue to assess the potential impact of the transition of the LoopNet marketplace to a pure marketing site for commercial real estate where all listings are paid and users can search the site for free. We are currently focused on converting LoopNet information customers to higher value, more profitable annual subscription information services, which should increase revenues and earnings over time. However, we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of any reductions in revenues and earnings 
6

or subsequent increases in revenues and earnings, if any, resulting from the elimination or phasing out of the LoopNet information services or any other service offering.
Our revenues have increased as a result of revenues from acquired businesses and from cross-selling opportunities among the customers of CoStar and the acquired companies. We expect to continue to increase revenues as a result of such cross-selling opportunities. We may incur increased expenses in connection with any marketing and sales campaigns involving cross-selling opportunities and initiatives, and in connection with promotion of our new services and brands. 
7

We are expanding the geographic reach of our North America services. In 2014, we began our Canadian research operations in Toronto; in 2015 we expanded into Calgary and Vancouver. In 2016, we began offering services in Ottawa and Edmonton. On July 1, 2015, we expanded our International services into Madrid, Spain through the acquisition of the assets of Belbex, a small commercial real estate information provider operating in Madrid, Spain. Further, on May 3, 2016, we expanded our International services into key markets in Germany, through the acquisition of Thomas Daily, a commercial real estate news and information provider operating in Freiburg, Germany. We believe that our integration efforts and continued investments in our services, including expansion of our existing service offerings, have created a platform for long-term revenue growth. We expect these investments to result in further penetration of our subscription-based services and the successful cross-selling of our services to customers in existing markets.
We have invested in the expansion and development of our field sales force to support the growth and expansion of our company and our service offerings in North America and internationally. We plan to continue to invest in, evaluate and strategically position our sales force as the Company continues to develop and grow. We also continue to invest in our research operations to support continued growth of our information and analytics offerings, to support the Apartments.com network, to expand into additional Canadian markets and to provide services in Madrid, Spain and key markets in Germany. We established our research operations headquarters in Richmond, Virginia, which is developing into a technology innovation hub, powering the software development necessary to support the content within our information, analytics and marketing services. In connection with the opening of the Richmond research headquarters, we expanded our research team to continue to meet the growing content needs of our clients. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in our International research operations in Madrid, Spain and the U.K. While we believe investments we make in our business create a platform for growth, those investments may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position. 
We intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business, in addition to the investments discussed above, in order to develop and distribute new services within our current platform or expand the reach of our current service offerings. Any future product development or expansion of services, combination and coordination of services or elimination of services or corporate expansion, development or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures. Any new investments, changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future. We expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services, introduce new services, integrate products and services, cross-sell existing services, and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research and sales and marketing organizations. We are committed to continuing to support and improve our information, analytics and online marketplace solutions. 
Industry Overview
The market for commercial real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety, volume and value of transactions related to commercial real estate. Each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements, and in order to facilitate transactions, industry participants must have extensive, accurate and current information and analysis. Members of the commercial real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability, properties for sale, rental units available, rental rates, vacancy rates, tenant movements, sales comparables, supply, new construction, absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively. Market research (including historical and forecast conditions) and applied analytics have also become instrumental to the success of commercial real estate industry participants operating in the current economic environment. There is a strong need for an efficient marketplace, where commercial real estate professionals can exchange information, evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses, and interact with each other on a continuous basis.

A large number of parties involved in the commercial real estate and related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses, including:

• | Sales and leasing brokers | • | Government agencies 
• | Property owners | • | Mortgage-backed security issuers
• | Property managers | • | Appraisers 
• | Design and construction professionals | • | Pension fund managers 
• | Real estate developers | • | Reporters 
• | Real estate investment trust managers | • | Tenant vendors 
• | Investment bankers | • | Building services vendors 
• | Commercial bankers | • | Communications providers 
• | Mortgage bankers | • | Insurance companies’ managers 
• | Mortgage brokers | • | Institutional advisors 
• | Retailers | • | Investors and asset managers 

The commercial real estate and related business community historically operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace. Various organizations, including hundreds of brokerage firms, directory publishers and local research companies, collected data on specific markets and developed software to analyze the information they independently gathered. This highly fragmented methodology resulted in duplication of effort in the collection and analysis of information, excessive internal cost and the creation of non-standardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness, resulting in a formidable information gap. 
The creation and maintenance of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires infrastructure including a standardized database, accurate and comprehensive research capabilities, experienced analysts, easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction. By combining our extensive database, researchers , our experienced team of analysts and economists, technological expertise and broad customer base, we believe that we have created such a platform.
Within the apartment rental community, most apartment listing websites primarily supply only the listings that property owners pay to advertise and often return results that are inconsistent with the renter's search criteria. These limited results generally do not provide information about the actual rental availabilities. We believe that consumers expect accurate, actionable and comprehensive apartment rental information. To create the Apartments.com, ApartmentFinder.com, and Apartamentos.com websites, we drew on our multifamily database and undertook a research effort collecting and verifying information and visiting and photographing properties. With the Apartments.com, ApartmentFinder.com and Apartamentos.com websites, we believe that we created easily searchable sites with a comprehensive selection of rentals, information on actual rental availabilities and rents, and in-depth data on neighborhoods, including restaurants, nightlife, history, schools and other important facts.
CoStar’s Comprehensive Database
CoStar has spent more than 30 years building and acquiring a database of commercial real estate information, which includes information on leasing, sales, comparable sales, tenants, and demand statistics, as well as digital images. This highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields, tracking such categories as location, site and zoning information, building characteristics, space and unit availability, tax assessments, ownership, sales and lease comparables, space requirements, number of retail stores, number of listings, mortgage and deed information, for-sale and for-lease listings, income and expense histories, tenant names, lease expirations, contact information, historical trends, demographic information and retail sales per square foot. The database also includes building photographs, aerial photographs, 3D virtual apartment tours, plat maps and floor plans.
CoStar Research
We have developed a sophisticated data collection organization utilizing a multi-faceted research process. In 2017, our full time researchers and contractors conducted millions of interviews of brokers, owners, tenants, apartment community owners and property managers. We recently established our research operations headquarters in Richmond, Virginia, which is developing into a technology innovation hub, powering the software development necessary to support the content within our information, analytics and marketing services.

Research Department. Our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department. Our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through millions of phone calls, e-mails and Internet updates each year, in addition to field inspections, public records review, news monitoring and direct mail. We have also set up direct feeds from larger apartment sites and have put in place an automated system that compiles information sourced from the Internet in order to provide the most up-to-date information on rental availabilities. 
Our researchers are responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of our database information. As part of their update process, researchers develop cooperative relationships with industry professionals that allow them to gather useful information. Because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry, many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions to our researchers.
CoStar has an extensive field research effort that includes physical inspection of properties in order to research new availabilities, find additional property inventory, photograph properties, collect tenant information, and verify existing information. In 2017, our field researchers drove millions of miles and conducted hundreds of thousands of on-site building inspections. CoStar's field research effort also includes creating high quality videos of interior spaces (including walk-through videos and 3D virtual tours), amenities and exterior features of properties. CoStar utilizes high-tech, field research vehicles across the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Spain. A significant majority of these vehicles are customized, energy efficient hybrid cars that are equipped with computers, Global Positioning System tracking software, high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to help precisely measure buildings, geo-code them and position them on digital maps. Each CoStar vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data. A typical site inspection consists of photographing the building, measuring the building, geo-coding the building, capturing “For Sale” or “For Lease” sign information, counting parking spaces, assessing property condition and construction, and gathering tenant information. Field researchers also canvass properties, collecting tenant data suite by suite. We also utilize a low-flying airplane and a fleet of drones to conduct aerial research of commercial real estate. We place researchers on the low-flying aircraft to scout additional commercial developments and take aerial photographs and videos. Our drone operators are FAA certified and trained to capture aerial photographs and videos of commercial real estate.
Data and Image Providers. We license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and third-party data sources. Licensing agreements with these entities allow us to use a variety of commercial real estate information, including property ownership, tenant information, demographic information, maps, aerial photographs and 3D virtual apartment tours of apartment communities, all of which enhance various CoStar services. These license agreements generally grant us a non-exclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information, analytics and online marketplaces and include what we believe are standard terms, such as a contract term ranging from one to five years, automatic renewal of the contract and fixed periodic license fees or a combination of fixed periodic license fees plus additional fees based upon our usage.
Management and Quality Control Systems. Our research processes include automated and non-automated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process. A large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors, including occupancy date conflicts, available square footage greater than building area, typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases. We also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology. Our non-automated quality control procedures include:

• | calling our information sources on recently updated properties to re-verify information;


• | performing periodic research audits and field checks to determine if we correctly canvassed buildings;


• | providing training and retraining to our research professionals to ensure accurate and standardized data compilation; and


• | compiling measurable performance metrics for research teams and managers for feedback on data quality.

Finally, one of the most important and effective quality control measures we rely on is feedback provided by the commercial real estate professionals using our data every day.

Clients
We draw clients from across the commercial real estate and related business community, including commercial real estate brokers, owners, developers, landlords, property managers, financial institutions, retailers, vendors, appraisers, investment banks, government agencies and other parties involved in commercial real estate. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, no single client accounted for more than 5% of our revenues.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales teams are primarily located in field sales offices throughout the U.S. and in offices outside of the U.S., including, among others, London, England; Madrid, Spain; and Freiburg, Germany. Our inside sales teams are primarily located in our Washington, DC office. These teams prospect for new clients and perform product and service demonstrations exclusively by telephone and over the Internet to support the direct sales force.
Our local offices typically serve as the platform for our in-market sales, customer support and field research operations for their respective regions. The sales force is responsible for selling to new prospects, training new and existing clients, providing ongoing customer support, renewing existing client contracts and identifying cross-selling opportunities. In addition, the sales 
15

force has primary front line responsibility for customer care. Our customer service and support staff is charged with ensuring high client satisfaction by providing ongoing customer support. In 2016, we formed a customer relationship team consisting of client relationship managers in the sales organization, to drive even greater usage of our products and services. The client relationship managers are responsible for training existing users, sharing market specific research with clients, ensuring accurate and timely listings and ensuring client driven product enhancement ideas are shared with our product development team.

Our sales strategy is to aggressively attract new clients, while providing ongoing incentives for existing clients to subscribe to additional products and services in order to achieve high renewal rates. We actively manage client accounts in order to retain clients by providing frequent service demonstrations as well as company-client contact and communication. In January 2018, we launched a two-week, 30-city road show to showcase CoStar's technologies to customers and prospective users. The presentations focused on how technological change is impacting the commercial real estate industry, including presentations on tools such as 3D cameras, infrared drones and augmented reality. We place a premium on training new and existing client personnel on the use of our services so as to promote maximum client utilization and satisfaction with our services. Our strategy also involves entering into multi-year, multi-market license agreements with our larger clients.
We seek to make our services essential to our clients’ businesses. To encourage clients to use our services regularly, we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription-based information services rather than fees based on actual system usage. Contract rates for subscription-based services are generally based on the number of sites, number of users, organization size, the client’s business focus, geography, the number and types of services to which a client subscribes, the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a client's advertised properties in the search results. Our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis, but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis.
Our primary marketing methods include: service demonstrations; face-to-face networking; web-based marketing; direct marketing; communication via our corporate website and news services; participation in trade show and industry events; Company-sponsored events; print advertising in trade magazines and other business publications; client referrals; and CoStar AdvisorTM, LoopNewsTM and other company newsletters distributed via email to our clients and prospects. In 2017, we integrated the CoStar and LoopNet databases in order to enhance CoStar information services as information tools and LoopNet marketplace services as marketing tools. This integration provides clients the ability to enter listings into a new Listing Manager, and to subsequently update their listings in CoStar and LoopNet simultaneously. To generate awareness of the integration, we provided video tutorials and hosted numerous webinars, in addition to web-based marketing and direct marketing efforts. 
In 2017, we expanded the Apartments.com network with the launch of Apartamentos.com and acquisition of WestsideRentals.com.  In February 2018, we further expanded the Apartments.com network with the acquisition of ForRent.com. To generate brand awareness and site traffic for the Apartments.com network, we utilize a multi-channel marketing campaign featuring television and radio ads, online and digital advertising impressions, social media, public relations, out-of-home and paid search marketing, all of which are reinforced with Search Engine Marketing efforts. We plan to continue to utilize these marketing methods and will continue to work to determine the optimal level of marketing investment for our services for future periods.
Web-based marketing and direct marketing are effective means for us to find prospective clients. Our web-based marketing efforts include search engine optimization, paid advertising with major search engines, social media and display advertising on commercial real estate news and business websites and mobile applications, and our direct marketing efforts include television, radio, out-of-home ads, direct mail, email and telemarketing, and, when applicable, make extensive use of our unique, proprietary database. Once we have identified a prospective client, our most effective sales method is a service demonstration. We use various forms of advertising to build brand identity and reinforce the value and benefits of our services. We also sponsor and attend local association activities and events, including industry-leading events for commercial real estate brokers, owner/investors and retail and financial services institutions, and attend and/or exhibit at industry trade shows and conferences to reinforce our relationships with our core user groups. 
News has always been a valuable part of CoStar's core subscription offering. CoStar's news teams report on the latest deals and developments across our markets, keeping subscribers informed and driving higher usage in our core product. In 2018, we plan to add more options for subscribers to customize the specific topics and types of news they are most interested in. To enhance this aspect of our subscription offering, we redesigned our homepage during the fourth quarter of 2017 to present an engaging and continuously updated interface. This year, we are adding news talent, upgrading technology, and making our service more relevant for subscribers, by delivering specific news based on their individual preferences. 
We believe the ability to customize and personalize news for the user's specific interests should make our news service even more relevant and valuable to subscribers. In addition to encouraging more engagement through logins and time on site, we believe a more robust news operation will also provide more options and formats for advertising to the commercial real estate audience.
We currently offer dozens of webinars each year aimed at helping customers learn more about the commercial real estate industry and how to use our services. The webinars are available both as live presentations and as on-demand programs hosted on our website. On a monthly basis, we issue the CoStar Commercial Repeat Sales Index ("CCRSI"), a comprehensive set of benchmarks that investors and other market participants can use to better understand commercial real estate price 
17

movements. CCRSI is produced using our underlying data and is publicly distributed by CoStar through the news media and made available online at http://www.costargroup.com/costar-news/ccrsi.
Our sales and marketing efforts have focused and will continue to focus on cross-selling and marketing our services. Similar to our prior acquisitions, we have been cross-selling, and plan to continue to cross-sell, the services offered by Apartments.com and ApartmentFinder.com and the other services we offer, including, but not limited to CoStar Suite. Now that we have completed the ForRent acquisition, we plan to develop and cross-sell the services offered by ForRent. We will also continue to focus on converting LoopNet information users to CoStar as we phase out the LoopNet information service offerings.

Competition
The market for information, analytics and online marketplaces generally is competitive and rapidly changing. In the commercial real estate and apartment rentals industries, we believe the principal competitive factors affecting these services and providers are:

• | quality and depth of the underlying databases;


• | ease of use, flexibility and functionality of the software;


• | intuitiveness and appeal of the user interface;


• | timeliness of the data, including listings;


• | breadth of geographic coverage and services offered;


• | completeness and accuracy of content;


• | client service and support;


• | perception that the service offered is the industry standard;


• | price;


• | effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts;


• | proprietary nature of methodologies, databases and technical resources;


• | vendor reputation;


• | brand loyalty among customers; and


• | capital resources.

We compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies:

• | online marketing services or websites targeted to commercial real estate brokers, buyers and sellers of commercial real estate properties, insurance companies, mortgage brokers and lenders, such as PropertyLine.com, Reed Business Information Limited, officespace.com, 42floors, MrOfficeSpace.com, TenantWise, www.propertyshark.com, Rofo, BuildingSearch.com, CIMLS, CompStak, Rightmove, estatesgazette.com, CommercialCafe, CREXi, TotalCommercial.com, and DebtX;


• | publishers and distributors of information, analytics and marketing services, including regional providers and national print publications, such as CBRE Economic Advisors, Marshall & Swift, Yale Robbins, Reis, Real Capital Analytics, The Smith Guide, Yardi Matrix, RealPage and its Axiometrics business, ReScour, Inc. and RealMassive;


• | Internet listing services featuring apartments for rent, such as ApartmentGuide.com, Rent.com, Zillow Rentals, Trulia Rent, NakedApartments.com, MyNewPlace.com, Zumper, Craigslist, ApartmentList.com, Move.com, Realtor.com, and Doorsteps.com;


• | locally controlled real estate boards, exchanges or associations sponsoring property listing services and the companies with whom they partner, such as Catylist, the National Association of Realtors, CCIM Institute, Society of Industrial and Office Realtors, the Commercial Association of Realtors Data Services and the Association of Industrial Realtors; 


• | real estate portfolio management software solutions, such as Cougar Software, MRI Software, Altus and Intuit;


• | real estate lease management and administration software solutions, such as Accruent, Tririga, Manhattan Software, Lucemex and AMT;


• | in-house research departments operated by commercial real estate brokers; and


• | public record providers.

As the market for information, analytics and online marketplaces develops, additional competitors (including companies which could have greater access to data, financial, product development, technical, analytic or marketing resources than we do) may enter the market and competition may intensify. For example, a company like Bloomberg L.P. has the resources, and has previously announced an intention, to move into the commercial real estate information business. Further, a company like Google, which has a far-reaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities, could enter the commercial real estate marketing arena. A company like Zillow, which already has a presence in residential real estate and the apartment rentals industry, could use its resources to further expand in the online apartment rentals industry creating greater competition among Internet listing services for the marketing budgets of property managers and property owners. While we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors, current or future competitors could materially harm our business.

Proprietary Rights
To protect our proprietary rights in our methodologies, database, software, trademarks and other intellectual property, we depend upon a combination of:

• | trade secret, misappropriation, copyright, trademark, computer fraud, database protection and other laws;


• | registration of copyrights and trademarks;


• | nondisclosure, noncompetition and other contractual provisions with employees and consultants;


• | license agreements with customers;


• | patent protection; and


• | technical measures.

We seek to protect our software’s source code, our database and our photography as trade secrets and under copyright law. Although copyright registration is not a prerequisite for copyright protection, we have filed for copyright registration for many of our databases, photographs, software and other materials. Under current U.S. copyright law, the arrangement and selection of data may be protected, but the actual data itself may not be. Certain U.K. database protection laws provide additional protections for our U.K. databases. We license our services under license agreements that grant our clients non-exclusive, non-transferable rights. These agreements restrict the disclosure and use of our information and prohibit the unauthorized reproduction or transfer of any of our proprietary information, methodologies or analytics.
We also attempt to protect our proprietary databases, our trade secrets and our proprietary information through confidentiality and noncompetition agreements with our employees and consultants. Our services also include technical measures designed to detect, discourage and prevent unauthorized copying of our intellectual property. We have established an internal antipiracy team that uses fraud-detection technology to continually monitor use of our services to detect and prevent unauthorized access, and we actively prosecute individuals and firms that engage in this unlawful activity.
We maintain U.S. and international trademark registrations for CoStar’s core service names and proactively file U.S. and international trademark applications covering our new and planned service names. Our federally registered trademarks include CoStar®, CoStar Property®, CoStar COMPS Professional®, CoStar Tenant®, CoStar Go®, CoStar Lease Analysis®, CoStar Showcase®, and LoopNet®, among many others. In the U.S., trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and have not been found to be generic. We consider our trademarks in the aggregate to constitute a valuable asset. In addition, we maintain a patent portfolio that protects certain of our systems and methodologies. We currently have one granted patent in the U.K., which expires in 2021, covering, among other things, certain of our field research methodologies and seven patents in the U.S. which expire in 2020, 2021 (2 patents), 2022 (2 patents), 2025 and 2032, respectively, covering, among other things, critical elements of CoStar’s proprietary field research technology and mapping tools. We regard the rights protected by our patents as valuable to our business, but do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single patent or on our portfolio of patents as a whole.
Employees
As of January 31, 2018, we employed 3,711 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are excellent. In common with many German companies, employees in our German subsidiary, Thomas Daily GmbH, have elected three fellow employees to form a Works Council, which represents our employees at the location and has certain rights to receive information from us and engage us in discussions under applicable law.
