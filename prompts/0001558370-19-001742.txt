     Company Overview
    
Zynerba Pharmaceuticals is the leader in pharmaceutically-produced transdermal cannabinoid therapies for rare and near-rare neuropsychiatric disorders. We are committed to improving the lives of patients and their families living with severe, chronic health conditions including Fragile X syndrome, or FXS, Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD, 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, or 22q, and a heterogeneous group of rare and ultra-rare epilepsies known as developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, or DEE.        We are currently evaluating ZygelTM, a patent-protected transdermal cannabidiol, or CBD, gel for the treatment of FXS, DEE and ASD. Prior to February 2019, Zygel was referred to as ZYN002. In 2017, we completed three Phase 2 clinical trials for Zygel and two of those trials have open-label extensions that are ongoing. In April 2018, we initiated an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating Zygel in children and adolescent patients with DEE, and in July 2018, we initiated what we believe will be a pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating Zygel in children and adolescent patients with FXS. In December 2018, we announced that we will postpone the initiation of a second Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating Zygel in adult refractory epilepsy and that we also intend to evaluate Zygel in ASD and 22q. In March 2019, we initiated an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating Zygel in children and adolescent patients with ASD.
     Cannabinoids are a class of compounds derived from Cannabis plants. The two primary cannabinoids contained in Cannabis are CBD and ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that CBD has positive effects on treating behavioral symptoms of FXS, ASD, 22q and seizures in patients with epilepsy. 
     Zygel is the first and only pharmaceutically-produced CBD formulated as a permeation‑enhanced gel for transdermal delivery, and the formulation is patent protected through 2030. An additional patent, directed to methods of treating FXS with synthetic or purified CBD, will expire in 2038. CBD is the primary non‑euphoric component of Cannabis. In preclinical animal studies, Zygel’s permeation enhancer increased delivery of CBD through the layers of the skin and into the circulatory system. These preclinical studies suggest increased bioavailability, consistent plasma levels and the avoidance of first‑pass liver metabolism of CBD when delivered transdermally. In addition, an in vitro study published in Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research in April 2016 demonstrated that CBD is degraded to THC (the major psychoactive cannabinoid in Cannabis) in an acidic environment such as the stomach. As a result, we believe such degradation may lead to increased psychoactive effects if CBD is delivered orally and may be avoided with the transdermal delivery of Zygel, which maintains CBD in a neutral pH. Zygel, which is being developed as a clear gel with once- or twice-daily dosing, is targeting treatment of behavioral symptoms of FXS, ASD and 22q and reductions in seizures in patients with DEE. We have been granted orphan drug designation from the FDA for the use of CBD for the treatment of FXS. In our Phase 1 program, Zygel was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated, provided a favorable CBD pharmacokinetic profile, and no THC was detected in plasma or urine. As of June 2018, the Zygel safety database across all clinical studies conducted by us includes data from 570 volunteers and patients. Across these clinical studies, Zygel has been well tolerated and consistent with previously reported data. 
     In April 2018, we initiated the Phase 2 BELIEVE 1 (Open Label Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Zygel Administered as a Transdermal Gel to Children and Adolescents with Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy) clinical trial, a six-month open label multi-dose clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zygel in children and adolescents (three to 17 years) with DEE as classified by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) (Scheffer et al. 2017). Enrollment in this study was complete in December 2018 and 48 patients with confirmed DEE are being dosed in the clinical trial, 27% of whom have either Dravet or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Enrolled patients will receive weight-based initial doses of 250 mg daily or 500 mg daily and during the maintenance phase patients may 

 
  5

 

receive up to 1000 mg daily of Zygel. The primary endpoint is change in seizure frequency from baseline. We expect to report top line results from the BELIEVE 1 trial in the third quarter of 2019.
     In July 2018, we initiated the pivotal CONNECT-FX (Clinical study of Cannabidiol (CBD) in Children and Adolescents with Fragile X) clinical trial, a multi-national randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-week study that will assess the efficacy and safety of Zygel in children and adolescents ages three through 17 years who have full mutation of the FMR1 gene. Approximately 200 male and female patients with FXS will be enrolled at approximately 20 clinical sites in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The study is being conducted in the United States under an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application opened with the FDA. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either trial drug or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by gender, weight, and investigator geographic region. Enrolled patients will receive weight-based doses of 250 mg or 500 mg daily. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community FXS Specific, ABC-CFXS Social Avoidance subscale. Key secondary endpoints are the change from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the ABC-CFXS Irritability subscale score, the ABC-CFXS Socially Unresponsive/Lethargic subscale score, and improvement in Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) at the end of the treatment period. Based on discussions with the FDA, we will anchor the CGI-I scale to behavioral symptoms of FXS. Consistent with recent guidance from the FDA on capturing the voice of the patient in drug development, additional qualitative data on the clinical relevance of various FXS behaviors to caregivers and patients will be collected. If we obtain positive results from this trial, we plan to request a meeting with the FDA to determine the acceptability of these data as the basis for a new drug application, or NDA filing. We expect to report top line results from the CONNECT-FX trial in the second half of 2019. 
     In March 2019, we initiated the Phase 2 BRIGHT (An Open-Label Tolerability and Efficacy Study of ZYN002 Administered as a Transdermal Gel to Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder) trial. The study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Zygel for the treatment of child and adolescent patients with ASD. The Company expects to present top line data from this study in the first half of 2020.

Zygel Clinical Development Timelines
    
Our key development programs and expected timelines for the development of Zygel are shown in the chart below: 
    
     Cannabinoid Science Overview
     CBD produces multiple effects; CBD is an agonist of the serotonin receptor (5-HT1A), a modulator of the endocannabinoid system, a positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, a modulator of α3 and α1 glycine receptors, an antagonist of G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR-55), a modulator of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter, and regulates the intracellular effects of calcium.
     CBD modulates the endocannabinoid system by inhibiting the metabolism (breakdown) of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide. This inhibition is thought to result in increased anandamide and 2-AG availability, greater CB1 and CB2 activation, and increased synaptic plasticity. The effect of CBD on the endocannabinoid system is the scientific basis for the use of CBD in the treatment of FXS, ASD and 22q. 
     CBD may also treat the neuropsychiatric symptoms of these conditions due to its activity as an agonist at 5-HT1A and an antagonist at GPR55 receptors.
     The modulation of the nucleoside transporter, antagonism of GPR55 receptors, and regulation of intercellular calcium are known to decrease neuronal excitability and are the scientific basis of the antiepileptic potential of CBD.
     Clinical and preclinical data suggest that CBD has positive effects on treating FXS, ASD and epilepsy. Clinical data suggest that CBD has a very high therapeutic index. Interest in cannabinoid therapeutics has increased significantly over the past several years as preclinical and clinical data has emerged highlighting the potential efficacy and safety benefits of cannabinoid therapeutics. Epidiolex®, a sesame oil liquid formulation of highly concentrated CBD was approved by 

 
  7

 

the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of two specific epilepsies, LGS and Dravet. The cannabinoid therapeutics market is expected to grow significantly due to the potential benefits these products may provide over existing therapies. 
     Product Candidates
     Zygel – CBD Transdermal Gel
     Zygel is the first and only pharmaceutically-produced CBD formulated as a permeation‑enhanced gel for transdermal delivery (see Figure 1), and is patent protected through 2030. 
     Figure 1 — Chemical structure and transdermal gel delivery of CBD.
     Zygel is being developed as a clear gel that is designed to provide consistent, controlled drug delivery with convenient once‑ or twice‑daily dosing. Because CBD is virtually insoluble in water, we use a patent protected formulation containing ethanol and propylene glycol as solubilizing agents and Transcutol ® HP as a permeation enhancer. All excipients in the gel have been classified as Generally Recognized As Safe, or GRAS, and have been used in transdermal products previously approved by the FDA.
     The permeation enhancer in Zygel increases the delivery of CBD through the layers of the skin and into the circulatory system.
     Transdermal delivery allows the CBD in Zygel to avoid stomach acid degradation and the first‑pass liver metabolism that occurs with oral or oral mucosal delivery methods. Drugs applied transdermally are absorbed across the skin into the systemic circulation, enabling the potential to have a consistent absorption with increased bioavailability.
    
Development of Zygel for the Treatment of Behavioral Symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome
     FXS Overview
     FXS is a rare genetic condition that causes intellectual disability, anxiety disorders, behavioral and learning challenges and various physical characteristics. The impairment can range from learning disabilities to more severe cognitive or intellectual disabilities. FXS is the leading known cause of both inherited intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Patients with FXS may exhibit autism like symptoms including anxiety, social impairment and social avoidance (seeks isolation from others, does not want to be with other children, avoids all types of new social engagements) and restricted/repetitive behaviors. Currently, there are no known cures or approved therapies indicated for the treatment of FXS or its symptoms. Special education and symptomatic treatments for anxiety and irritability are employed to lessen the burden of illness. Based on the 2012 U.S. Census and the National Fragile X Foundation, or NFXF, FXS prevalence is estimated at approximately 71,000 patients in the United States. According to the NFXF, FXS affects 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 males and 1 in 4,000 to 6,000 females of all races and ethnic groups.

    We believe Zygel may provide an effective treatment for FXS based on its capacity to interact with the endocannabinoid system, which is compromised in patients with FXS. Specifically, CBD modulates the endocannabinoid system by inhibiting the metabolism (breakdown) of 2-AG and anandamide. This inhibition is thought to result in increased anandamide and 2-AG availability, greater CB1 and CB2 activation, and increased synaptic plasticity. This modulation is the scientific basis for the use of CBD in the treatment of FXS. We anticipate Zygel may be used as first line therapy to treat patients suffering from behavioral symptoms of FXS.
    
Phase 2 Clinical Trials 
     In September 2017, we released the results for our open-label exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zygel in children with FXS, which we refer to as the FAB-C (Treatment of Fragile X Syndrome Anxiety and Behavioral Challenges with CBD) trial. The primary endpoint for the trial was the change in the total score of the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale, or ADAMS, from baseline to week 12. The ADAMS is a 28-item scale designed to assess general anxiety, social avoidance, compulsive behavior, manic/hyperactive behavior, and depressed mood. It has been validated in patients with FXS. Twenty patients (3:1 males) aged 6 to 17 years of age (mean = 10.7) with FXS, as confirmed by molecular documentation of FMR1 full mutation, were enrolled in the open-label FAB-C study. Zygel was added on to other medications being administered. The first six weeks of the study were designed to titrate dosing in patients. Dosing was initiated at 50 mg daily and could be increased to 250 mg daily. Weeks 7 through 12 of the study were a maintenance period where patients were treated at the dose established at week six. At the completion of the study, patients could enter an open-label extension study for up to 12 months. 
    
The FAB-C trial successfully met its primary endpoint, achieving a 46% improvement (p<0.0001) in the total score of ADAMS at week twelve compared to baseline.

 Results for the ADAMS at week 12 are summarized as follows: 
     
     Zygel also achieved clinically meaningful improvements in all measures of the ABC-CFXS, which addresses the key behavioral symptoms of FXS including social avoidance, repetitive movements, and socially unresponsive behaviors. The study achieved statistical significance across all ABC-CFXS subscales compared to baseline.
     Results from the ABC-CFXS at week 12 are summarized as follows:

 We evaluated multiple other secondary endpoints including a Clinical Global Impression of Improvement, or CGI-I, the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, or PARS-R, Visual Analog Scales for Anxiety, Hyperactivity and Tantrum/Mood Lability, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior III, a Quality of Sleep measurement and the Pediatric Quality of Life, or PedsQL™. The results of the ABC-CFXS and other secondary endpoints reinforce the results demonstrated in the ADAMS. 
     Zygel was shown to be very well tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent with data from earlier clinical trials and our other Phase 2 clinical trials for Zygel. All adverse events were considered mild to moderate and no serious adverse events were reported. No patient experienced drug-related GI events during the 12-week treatment period, and no THC was detected in the plasma. Thirteen of the 18 patients who completed the study have enrolled in the open-label extension and 11 patients are still in the study as of March 4, 2019. 
      In December 2018, we presented new 12-month open label clinical data from the FAB-C trial describing the long-term impact of Zygel on emotional and behavioral symptoms of FXS in a poster presentation at the 57th Annual Meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP).  The statistically significant improvements in the core emotional and behavioral symptoms of FXS versus baseline as measured by the ADAMS and the ABC-CFXS were sustained through 12 months of treatment. In the Social Avoidance subscale of the ABC-CFXS, patients completing 12 months of treatment with Zygel experienced a 77% improvement in social avoidance behaviors versus baseline, compared to a 58% improvement at three months of treatment. Both results are statistically significant compared to baseline. The Social Avoidance subscale of the ABC-CFXS is the primary endpoint of the ongoing pivotal CONNECT-FX study of Zygel. Zygel continues to be well tolerated in this study, no serious adverse events were reported, and no clinically meaningful trends in vital signs, ECG, or clinical safety laboratories, including liver function tests, were observed.
     Results for the ADAMS at 12 months are summarized as follows:

 Results from the ABC-CFXS at 12 months are summarized as follows:
    
     In March 2018, we announced the results of a positive meeting held with the FDA regarding our planned development strategy for Zygel in FXS. Based on our dialogue with the FDA, we initiated what we believe will be a single pivotal study mid-year 2018 to support an NDA for Zygel in FXS. We are in agreement with the FDA that the primary and key secondary endpoints for the study should assess observable behaviors in patients with FXS as reported by the caregiver using the validated ABC-CFXS. If the pivotal trial meets its endpoints, approval for an indication encompassing the treatment of behavioral symptoms associated with FXS may be granted.
     In July 2018, we initiated the pivotal CONNECT-FX (Clinical study of Cannabidiol (CBD) in Children and Adolescents with Fragile X) clinical trial, a multi-national randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-week study that will assess the efficacy and safety of Zygel in children and adolescents ages three through 17 years who have full mutation of the FMR1 gene. Approximately 200 male and female patients with FXS are being enrolled at approximately 20 clinical sites in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The study is being conducted in the United States under an IND application opened with the FDA. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either trial drug or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by gender, weight, and investigator geographic region. Enrolled patients will receive weight-based doses of 250 mg or 500 mg daily. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the ABC-CFXS Social Avoidance subscale. Key secondary endpoints are the change from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the ABC-CFXS Irritability subscale score, the ABC-CFXS Socially Unresponsive/Lethargic subscale score, and improvement in Clinical Global Impression – Improvement, or CGI-I, at the end of the treatment period. Based on discussions with the FDA, we will anchor the CGI-I scale to behavioral symptoms of FXS. Consistent with recent guidance from the FDA on capturing the voice of the patient in drug development, additional qualitative data on the clinical relevance of various FXS behaviors to caregivers and patients will be collected. If we obtain positive results from this trial, we plan to request a meeting with the FDA to determine the acceptability of these data as the basis for an NDA filing. We expect to report top line results from the CONNECT-FX trial in the second half of 2019.
     All patients will be eligible to enroll in a 12-month open-label extension after completing dosing in the pivotal study; patients are currently being enrolled into this extension.

 Development of Zygel for Treatment of Refractory Epileptic Seizures (DEE and Adult Refractory Focal Epilepsy)       
Refractory Epileptic Seizures Overview
     Epilepsy is a disease characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures (transient symptoms due to abnormal neuronal activity in the brain) and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of the condition. Focal seizures usually start in a small area of the temporal lobe or frontal lobe of the brain and quickly involve other areas of the brain that affect alertness and awareness. According to Decision Resources, in 2017 there were expected to be approximately 2.4 million epilepsy patients in the United States, of which approximately 60% suffer from focal seizures, and approximately one third of those patients (~ 500,000) are refractory to two or more anti-epileptic drugs, or AEDs.
      We believe that Zygel may provide an effective treatment for epilepsy based on the anticonvulsant effects of CBD due to its ability to reduce neuronal hyperexcitability shown in multiple in vivo models of epilepsy and clinical trials conducted by third parties. Epilepsy specialists and patient organizations have shown considerable interest in the potential therapeutic role of CBD in adults with epilepsy and especially, children with DEE. GW Pharmaceuticals, PLC, or GW, has received approval from the U.S. FDA to market Epidiolex®, a sesame oil liquid formulation of highly concentrated plant-extracted CBD, in the United States for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome, or DS, and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, or LGS. 
     DEE is a category of rare and ultra-rare severe brain disorders that manifest with seizures or EEG abnormalities that are associated with delay or regression in cognition and/or behavior. This category includes a number of epilepsy syndromes, including DS, LGS, Doose, and Ohtahara (early infantile epileptic encephalopathy), and early-onset epilepsy syndromes caused by variants of genes including SYNGAP1 and SCN1A, among others. DS is a severe form of epilepsy that appears during the first year of life as frequent fever-related seizures. As the condition progresses, other types of seizures typically occur, including myoclonus and status epilepticus. LGS is a severe form of epilepsy that typically becomes apparent during infancy or early childhood. Affected children experience several different types of seizures, most commonly atonic, or drop, tonic and atypical absence seizures. We believe, based on analysis and a recent publication (Aaberg et. al, Epilepsia, 2017; 58: 1880-1891) which incorporates new classification systems from the International League Against Epilepsy, or ILAE, that there are approximately 45,000 DEE patients in the United States, with the majority of those patients having DS or LGS. 
     Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Children and Adolescents with DEE
     In April 2018, we initiated the Phase 2 BELIEVE 1 (Open Label Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Zygel Administered as a Transdermal Gel to Children and Adolescents with Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy) clinical trial, a six-month open label multi-dose clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zygel in children and adolescents (three to 17 years) with DEE. Enrollment in this study was complete in December 2018 and 48 patients with confirmed DEE are being dosed in the clinical trial, 27% of whom have either DS or LGS. Enrolled patients will receive weight-based initial doses of 250 mg daily or 500 mg daily and during the maintenance phase patients may receive up to 1000 mg daily, of Zygel CBD gel. The primary endpoint is change in seizure frequency from baseline. We expect to report top line results from the BELIEVE 1 trial in the third quarter of 2019.
    
Phase 2 Clinical Trials in Adults with Refractory Focal Epilepsy
     In August 2017, we released the results for our Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, multi-center, multi-dose clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zygel in adult patients with refractory epileptic focal seizures (formerly known as complex partial seizures), which we refer to as the STAR 1 (Synthetic Transdermal Cannabidiol for the Treatment of Epilepsy) trial. The primary endpoint assessed the median percentage change in seizure frequency over the 12-week treatment period compared to the 8-week baseline period. Secondary endpoints included proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction from baseline in seizure frequency, percent change from baseline in seizure frequency, seizure-free days, and 100% seizure free. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated. The study was conducted at 14 sites in Australia and New Zealand. The results were not statistically significant.

 
  13

 


      Zygel was shown to be very well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with previously released data from our Phase 1 clinical trials. Of the 188 patients in the safety database, 50% of the patients on Zygel (n=63) had at least one treatment emergent adverse event, compared to 41% (n=26) of patients on placebo. Two treatment emergent adverse events occurred in greater than 5% of the patients on Zygel: fatigue (5.6%, placebo, 1.6%) and headache (5.6%, placebo, 3.2%). There were no treatment related serious adverse events reported. The discontinuation rate in the trial for Zygel was 10.4% compared to 1.6% in placebo. 
      In November 2016, we initiated an open-label extension clinical trial, which we refer to as the STAR 2 trial, for patients who successfully completed the STAR 1 trial. Of the 175 patients who completed the STAR 1 trial, 171 patients elected to enter the STAR 2 trial and as of March 1, 2019, 35 patients remain in the trial. Of the 171 patients who elected to participate in the STAR 2 trial, 111 patients have completed at least six months of treatment, 97 patients have completed at least nine months of treatment, 84 have completed at least twelve months of treatment and 28 have completed STAR 2 with 24 months of treatment. Once patients have completed 24 months of treatment in the STAR 2 trial, they can elect to receive Zygel through a Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA, sanctioned special access scheme, which will allow Zynerba to collect long-term safety and efficacy data on these patients. As of March 1, 2019, 26 patients have enrolled in the Zygel special access scheme.
     In December 2018, we presented data collected through July 31, 2018 on the long-term use of Zygel from the STAR 1 and STAR 2 trials at the American Epilepsy Society meeting. The STAR 2 primary efficacy analysis was the percent reduction from STAR 1 baseline at months three, six, nine, 12, 15 and 18 of STAR 2. These data demonstrated a strong, sustained response in the cohort of patients in STAR 2 who had received at least 18 months of treatment by July 31, 2018. This cohort of patients (n=63) experienced a median reduction in seizures of 49% after three months of treatment with Zygel, 53% at six months, 55% at nine months, 52% at 12 months, 54% at 15 months, and 55% at 18 months . Data across all patients demonstrate that the 390 mg group had the best and most consistent seizure reduction out to 18 months of treatment. Zygel was well tolerated, with good skin tolerability in STAR 2. No abnormal liver adverse events, defined as alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, were observed. We believe that these data show a consistent pattern of seizure reduction across all cohorts once treated with Zygel and they also suggest that clinically meaningful responses can be achieved with longer term use of Zygel.

     Figure 3 – Median Percent Change in Each Three-Month Interval Using Actual Dose in STAR 2 – All Patients
    

            In December 2018, we announced that we will postpone the initiation of our planned Phase 2B study of Zygel in adult refractory focal seizures until after reporting data from the four childhood neuropsychiatric studies (FXS, DEE, ASD and 22q) currently underway or planned to initiate in the first half of 2019.  This will also allow us to further analyze the patients who seem to be having long-term positive effects from Zygel to further analyze the data to evaluate the patients who seem to be having long-term positive effects from Zygel to determine any distinctive characteristics of these patients which may be evaluated in a future trial. 
     Development of Zygel for Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
     ASD is a developmental disability affecting approximately one million pediatric and adolescent patients between the ages of five and 17 in the U.S. It is a DSM-5 diagnosis, which includes Autistic Disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and 

 
  15

 

Rett’s disorders. It is characterized by anxiety, repetitive patterns of behavior, impairments in social communication including verbal and non-verbal communication, and deficits in developing, understanding and maintaining relationships. 
     Despite high awareness and advocacy efforts, the medical need in ASD is significant and unmet. There is an accelerating rate of diagnosis, yet only two agents, risperidone and aripiprazole, have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ASD symptoms. Both of these are atypical antipsychotics and carry a significant side effect profile, and neither is approved to address the key symptoms of social impairment and anxiety. The societal burden for ASD in the United States is expected to grow to $461 billion by 2025.
     Recent studies suggest that ASD may be associated with a disruption in the endocannabinoid system, which modulates many cellular functions and molecular pathways that are altered in ASD, including GABAergic imbalance, glutamatergic transmission, oxidative stress, immune dysregulation and altered energy metabolism. Altered anandamide (an endocannabinoid) signaling may contribute to ASD-related social and communication impairments. Clinical and anecdotal data show improvement in social avoidance and anxiety in children receiving treatment with CBD. Exogenous CBD may modulate the endocannabinoid system and improve certain autism-related behaviors. 
     In March 2019, we initiated the Phase 2 BRIGHT (An Open-Label Tolerability and Efficacy Study of ZYN002 Administered as a Transdermal Gel to Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder) trial. The study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Zygel for the treatment of child and adolescent patients with ASD. The Company expects to present top line data from this study in the first half of 2020.
     Development of Zygel for Treatment of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q)
     22q is the most common contiguous gene deletion syndrome; the microdeletion occurs on the long arm of chromosome 22 at a location designated q11.2. It is a rare disorder, affecting approximately 81,000 patients in the U.S. There are no drugs with an approved indication for the treatment of 22q. 
     22q is considered a mid-line condition, which is a defect or condition that occurs on the anterior portion of a body, usually in the middle or center of the body, with physical symptoms including characteristic palate abnormalities, heart defects, immune dysfunction, and esophageal / GI issues. There are two primary stages of 22q patient management. During infancy, doctors address the acute physical concerns, such as anomalies of heart and palate, with surgery. Once the physical concerns are stabilized, the focus shifts to managing the neuropsychiatric symptoms. Neuropsychiatric illnesses (anxiety disorders, ASD) and learning disabilities are common in this patient population. The syndrome is associated with increased anxiety, withdrawn behavior and social interaction problems. Early onset of these core neuropsychiatric symptoms may disrupt development and quality of life in these patients, and may heighten the risk of later psychotic disorders. Psychoses like schizophrenia are common in this population; there is a 25-fold increased risk of developing schizophrenia among people with 22q compared to the lifetime risk in the general population. Early control of anxiety may delay the development of such psychoses. 
     CBD may treat the neuropsychiatric symptoms of 22q due to its activity as an agonist at 5HT1A receptors, an antagonist at GPR55 receptors, and a modulator of the endocannabinoid system. 
     We expect to initiate an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial in Australia in the first half of 2019 to assess the ability of Zygel to treat the behavioral symptoms associated with this disorder. We expect to report top line data in the first half of 2020. 
     Early Clinical Trials
    
In June 2016, we completed two Phase 1 clinical trials for ZYN002 in healthy volunteers and patients with epilepsy. The first Phase 1 single rising dose clinical trial for ZYN002 in healthy human subjects and in patients with epilepsy evaluated the tolerability and pharmacokinetics, or PK, profile of ZYN002. Results from this clinical trial demonstrated that ZYN002 was safe and well-tolerated at all tested dose levels and the incidence of adverse events associated with ZYN002 was similar to placebo for both healthy subjects and epilepsy patients. The second Phase 1 clinical trial was a
 
  16

 

randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multiple rising dose clinical trial for ZYN002 in twenty-four healthy volunteers and twelve patients with epilepsy to evaluate the PK profile, pharmacodynamics, or PD, and tolerability of multiple doses (200, 250, and 500 mg) of ZYN002. Each volunteer and patient received seven days of either ZYN002 or placebo. Results from this clinical trial demonstrated that ZYN002 was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels. The twice daily dosing provided a more favorable PK profile with comparable results between healthy volunteers and epilepsy patients.
     Transdermal application of ZYN002 was very well tolerated with minimal skin erythema. Skin dryness at the application site was common for both Zygel and placebo gel. Overall, the incidence of adverse events associated with ZYN002 was similar to placebo in both healthy volunteers and adult epilepsy patients. There were no reports of somnolence or fatigue and a very low incidence of gastrointestinal events was observed. There were no serious adverse events or discontinuations for healthy volunteers and epilepsy patients receiving ZYN002. One healthy volunteer receiving placebo gel developed a serious adverse event suspected to be a catheter infection and was discontinued from the study. In addition, healthy volunteers and epilepsy patients had no drug related changes in performance on the Trail Making Test, a test of visual attention, psychomotor ability, and task switching; a divided attention task; and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task, or PASAT, a test that measures working memory and focused attention. These results indicate that ZYN002 did not produce impairment in critical areas of cognitive functioning often impacted by central nervous system drugs. No changes in mood symptoms as assessed by the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms, or IDAS, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, or PANAS were observed for ZYN002 suggesting that ZYN002 is not associated with declines in psychological health.

   
In July 2016, we completed a third Phase 1 clinical trial for ZYN002, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in 42 healthy volunteers. The volunteers received a range of CBD doses from 395 mg to 504 mg daily in 2.5% and 4.2% ZYN002 formulations for fourteen days. Results from this clinical trial demonstrated that ZYN002 was very well tolerated with minimal skin erythema. CBD plasma concentrations were dose dependent and did not fluctuate at steady state. The 4.2% formulation demonstrated a comparable PK and tolerability profile to the 2.5% concentration and was easier to use due to the lower volume. There were no serious adverse events or discontinuations from this clinical trial.
    
Overall, in the Phase 1 program, ZYN002 was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated, provided a favorable CBD PK profile, and no THC was detected in plasma or urine.
     ZYN001
     Our pipeline includes ZYN001, a pro-drug of THC.  In July 2018, we decided to pause the development of ZYN001 and focus our development efforts and investments on our development programs for Zygel.
     Intellectual Property
     The success of our product candidates will depend in large part on our ability to:
      obtain and maintain patent and other legal protections for the proprietary compounds, technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
      prosecute our patent applications and defend our issued patents;
      preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
      operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
     We internally developed our intellectual property related to our product candidates. We have sought and intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for our product candidates, as well as other proprietary technologies and their uses, by filing patent applications in the United States and selected other countries.

 
  17

 


     As of March 7, 2019, we owned a total of eleven issued U.S. utility patents. These U.S. patents will expire between 2029 through 2038. We have already obtained additional patent term for some of the issued patents to compensate us for delays at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, under the patent term adjustment laws. These patents, and any pending applications that ultimately issue as patents, may also be eligible for patent term extension for delay caused by FDA regulatory review, thereby further extending their patent terms.
     In addition to our U.S. intellectual property, we own 149 corresponding foreign issued patents, 2 allowed corresponding foreign applications, and five corresponding foreign applications, which will expire between 2026 and 2038. 
     Zygel
     Our Zygel patent portfolio currently consists of three issued patents in the United States, and 3 pending United States patent applications.  There are six issued patents in France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, one allowed patent application in Canada, and three pending PCT applications. The issued patents claim the permeation enhanced formulation of Zygel and methods of use relating to Zygel, including methods of treating Fragile X Syndrome.  The issued patents will expire between 2026 and 2038. Any patents that issue from our currently allowed Canadian patent application will expire in 2030.  We anticipate that any patents issued form our pending US applications or pending PCT applications will expire in 2038.     Other
     The rest of our patent portfolio relates to patents and applications owned by us and directed to other potential product candidates. 
     Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
     We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know‑how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention obligations. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials.     Manufacturing
     The active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, used in our product candidates are synthesized by contract manufacturers. Zygel is manufactured and filled into unit of use sachets by a contract manufacturer. 
     We selected our contract manufacturers for their specific competencies in manufacturing, product design, and materials. FDA regulations require that products be produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. Our key suppliers currently meet cGMPs and we believe have sufficient capacities to meet our projected product requirements through early commercialization.
     Commercial Operations
     Our Vice President of Commercial is responsible for pre-commercialization activities, including global market analysis, strategic optimization and value development associated with our product candidates, as well as business development activities as we evaluate partnering options. However, we do not currently have a fully integrated organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We may rely on licensing and co‑promotion agreements 

 
  18

 

with strategic collaborators for the commercialization of our products in the United States and other territories. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a sales force supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to any confirmation that Zygel will be approved.
     Competition
     The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We believe our scientific knowledge, technology, and development capabilities provide us with substantial competitive advantages, but we face potential competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies; academic institutions; governmental agencies; and public and private research institutions. Successfully developed and commercialized product candidates must compete not only with existing therapies, but also with agents that may become available in the future.
     We are studying Zygel in pediatric and adolescent patients with FXS, DEE, ASD and 22q.
    
There are no drugs approved for the treatment of FXS or its most common symptoms, although various classes of medications are used off‑label for the treatment of behavioral and mental health conditions associated with FXS. Some patients with FXS benefit from medications that treat attention deficit disorders and other patients who experience general anxiety, social anxiety and other chronic conditions may benefit from different types of anti‑anxiety medications. We are aware that Neuren Pharmaceuticals, Confluence Pharmaceuticals, Ovid Therapeutics and Tetra Discovery Partners among others are developing compounds for the treatment of FXS.
    
Within epilepsy, we intend to treat pediatric and adolescent patients with DEE. Second and third generation AEDs continue to improve upon first generation therapies, but experts contend that a better understanding of the disorder accompanied by fundamentally innovative treatments will be required to effectively improve treatment outcomes for the high percentage of patients who remain unresponsive to AEDs. The majority of AEDs have frequent safety concerns including serious CNS adverse events and drug‑drug interactions. 
    
GW has received approval from the FDA to market Epidiolex, a sesame oil liquid formulation of highly concentrated plant extracted CBD, in the United States for the treatment of DS and LGS. GW is also studying Epidiolex in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Rett Syndrome.  GW is studying additional cannabinoids, including cannabidivarin or CBDV, for adult patients with focal seizures, autism spectrum disorders and Rett Syndrome. Insys Therapeutics Inc., or Insys, is also developing a synthetic CBD oral solution compound for the treatment of childhood absence epilepsy, infantile spasms and Prader-Willi syndrome. 
     Two atypical antipsychotic drugs, risperidone and aripiprazole, are approved for autism-associated agitation and irritability, though neither is approved to address the key ASD symptoms of social impairment and anxiety. Various classes of medications are used off‑label for the treatment of behavioral conditions associated with ASD. Early intervention can improve learning, communication and social skills, as well as underlying brain development. Applied behavior analysis, or ABA, and therapies based on its principles are the most researched and commonly used behavioral interventions for autism. Many children affected by autism also benefit from other interventions such as speech and occupational therapy. 
     We are aware that GW is studying CBDV for use in patients with ASD. Insys is also considering CBD for use in ASD in collaboration with University of California San Diego School of Medicine’s Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research.
     There are no drugs approved for the treatment of 22q or its most common symptoms, although various classes of medications are used off‑label for the treatment of the behavioral symptoms. There are two primary stages of 22q patient management. During infancy, doctors address the acute physical concerns, such as anomalies of heart and palate, with 

 
  19

 

surgery. Once the physical concerns are stabilized, the focus shifts to managing the neuropsychiatric symptoms, with anxiety being a key symptom. Anxiety is predominately managed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also an important component of treatment. We are not aware of any studies of CBD, THC or any other cannabinoid in this patient population. 
     We are also aware of other companies that are working on non-cannabinoid treatments for indications similar to those  with Zygel, including Confluence Pharmaceuticals with acamprosate for FXS;  Tetra Discovery Partners with BPN14770, a selective small molecule inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase type-4D (PDE4D) subtype, for FXS; Ovid Therapeutics with OV101, a delta selective GABA receptor agonist for FXS and TAK-935/OV935, a Cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase Inhibitor, for DEE; Marinus Pharmaceuticals with ganaxolone for pediatric refractory epilepsies; Zogenix with fenfluramine hydrochloride (ZX-008) for LGS and DS; Roche with RO5285119 for ASD; and Janssen with JNJ-42165279 for ASD, among others.
     Government Regulation and Product Approval        As a development stage pharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our products in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and the European Commission but country‑specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and may not be successful.
     U.S. Government Regulation
     The FDA is the primary body that regulates pharmaceuticals in the United States, and its regulatory authority is based in the FDC Act. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. In particular, controlled substances, like CBD and THC, are regulated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA. A failure to comply with any requirements during the product development, approval, or post‑approval periods, may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions, which could include the imposition of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
     The steps required to obtain approval for commercialization of a new drug in the United States are lengthy, complex and expensive, and the outcome is far from certain. These steps generally include:
    
· | completion of preclinical studies, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND to support human clinical testing in the United States;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials in accordance with federal regulations and with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product candidate for each target indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
 
  20

 



· | submission of a NDA to the FDA;
--+--------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the investigational product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

      In certain cases, a drug may require scheduling by DEA prior to commercialization. This step is required if the drug has a potential for abuse and is not currently controlled (scheduled) by DEA or is controlled in Schedule I.
     Pre-clinical Testing
     Before testing any compound in humans in the United States, a company must develop pre-clinical data, generally including laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in animal species to assess safety and quality. Certain types of animal studies must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations and the Animal Welfare Act, which is enforced by the Department of Agriculture.     Clinical Trials
     FDA regulations require that the person or entity sponsoring or conducting a clinical study in the United States for the purpose of investigating a drug candidate’s safety and effectiveness submit to the FDA an IND application, which contains pre-clinical testing results and provides a basis for the FDA to conclude that there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans. A 30‑day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA does not place the proposed clinical trial in the IND application on clinical hold within this 30‑day period, the clinical trial may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols that detail, among other things, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be reviewed, approved and conducted under the auspices of an IRB. The sponsor, investigators, and IRB must, as applicable, obtain the informed written consent of each participating subject, comply with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitor the clinical trial, and timely report adverse events. We filed an IND with the FDA for Zygel in FXS in 2018 and have passed the 30-day waiting period. 
     In addition to filing an IND with the FDA, we must receive approval from the DEA prior to commencement of any clinical trials in the United States that involve the use of Schedule I controlled substances. In advance of commencing our CONNECT FX pivotal trial at sites in the United States, we received the required approval from the DEA.  
     We plan to submit NDAs for our product candidates to the FDA upon completion of all requisite clinical trials. The clinical investigation of an investigational product candidate is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:
    
· | Phase 1. Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of a product candidate into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, metabolism, PK and pharmacologic actions of the product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the product candidate’s safety, PK and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  21

 


    
· | Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted to develop initial data regarding the effectiveness of the product candidate in the target disease or condition, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and additional safety risks associated with the product candidate. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically controlled and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded subject population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the investigational product candidate has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit‑risk profile of the product candidate, and to provide an adequate basis for labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In most (though not all) cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to support approval of a drug.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The decision to terminate development of an investigational product candidate may be made by either a health authority body, such as the FDA, or IRB/ethics committees, or by a company for various reasons. The FDA may issue a “clinical hold,” ordering the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients, or for other reasons. In some cases, clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor called a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, or data monitoring committee, or DMC. A DSMB or DMC may provide recommendations on whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points, based on access to data from the ongoing trial. The suspension or termination of development can occur during any phase of clinical trials if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In addition, there are requirements for the registration of ongoing clinical trials of product candidates on public registries and the disclosure of certain information pertaining to the trials as well as clinical trial results after completion.
     A sponsor may request a special protocol assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design and size of certain clinical trials (including Phase 3 clinical trials), clinical studies, or animal studies to address applicable scientific and regulatory requirements. An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and if areas of agreement are reached, they will be documented in a letter. The agreement generally may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins, except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began. An SPA is not binding if new circumstances arise, and there is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to an SPA. 
     We have completed several Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials and have three ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials for Zygel in Australia and New Zealand.  We also have one ongoing Phase 2/3 clinical trial for Zygel in Australia, New Zealand and the United States.
     In Australia, the approval process for commencing Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials resides with the Human Research Ethics Committee, or HREC. Prior to commencing a clinical trial, a sponsor must submit to the HREC a study protocol, an investigator brochure and a template informed consent for such clinical trial. The HREC approval process generally takes four to eight weeks.
     Once a study is approved by the HREC, a Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN, is submitted to the Australian Government Department of Health, Therapeutic Goods Administration. The CTN is a notification that the HREC has approved the safety, efficacy and ethical acceptability of the trial, approved the trial protocol and evaluated the scientific merit of the trial. The TGA sends the clinical trial site a written acknowledgement of the clinical trial, allowing the clinical trial to begin. TGA response time to acknowledge a clinical trial is approximately two weeks from receipt of the CTN from the clinical trial site.

 New Drug Applications (NDA)
     In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed packaging and labeling, among other things. Data can come from company‑sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. Data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States may be accepted by the FDA subject to certain conditions. For example, the clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA must be able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an onsite inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless those data are considered applicable to the U.S. patient population and U.S. medical practice, the clinical trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data is considered valid without the need for an on‑site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on‑site inspection or other appropriate means. If the drug has a potential for abuse, the NDA must include a description and analysis of studies or information related to abuse of the drug, including a proposal for scheduling under the federal Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. A description of any studies related to overdosage is also required, including information on dialysis, antidotes, or other treatments, if known.
     In most cases, the NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee; there may be some instances in which the user fee is waived. The FDA will initially review the NDA for completeness before it accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the application is not sufficiently complete, the FDA may refuse to accept the NDA for filing and request additional information. A refusal to file, which requires resubmission of the NDA with the requested additional information, delays review of the application. If the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most NDAs for standard review product candidates are reviewed within twelve months of submission. The FDA can extend this review to consider certain late‑submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates that present challenging questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
     Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or, if the FDA concludes that an NDA does not meet the regulatory standards for approval, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA’s interpretation of data may differ from the sponsor’s. Obtaining approval can take years, requires substantial resources and depends on a 

 
  23

 

number of factors, including the severity of the targeted disease or condition, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials.
     An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post‑approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
     Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including certain changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA generally applies the same procedures and standards in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
     From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.  In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates.  It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.  For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, became law.  The Cures Act contains numerous provisions, including provisions designed to speed development of innovative therapies and encourage greater use of real-world evidence to support regulatory decision making for drugs.
     Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
     Some countries require sponsors of clinical trials of certain regulated products, including prescription drugs to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website. For example, in the United States, sponsors are required to register this information on a website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, at www.clinicaltrials.gov. In Australia and New Zealand, sponsors register clinical trial information on a website maintained by the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry at www.anzctr.org.au. When a clinical trial is registered on these websites, certain information regarding the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial must be posted. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of many of these trials after completion, although under certain circumstances disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly‑available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.     Advertising and Promotion
     The FDA and other federal agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, promotion to healthcare practitioners, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off‑label” uses — that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug’s labeling — because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA historically has restricted manufacturers’ communications regarding off‑label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off‑label use, but may engage in non‑promotional, balanced communication regarding off‑label use under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions 

 
  24

 

in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, as well as state authorities. This enforcement activity could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, state and federal fraud and abuse and consumer protection laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
     Other Post-Approval Regulations
     After a drug receives regulatory approval, its sponsor is required to comply with a number of post‑approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require post‑marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, as a holder of an approved NDA, a company is required to report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. cGMP includes requirements regarding organization and training of personnel, building and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers, closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls and records and reports. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before it can be implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon a sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that a sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements or the conditions of the product’s approval may lead the FDA to take enforcement action, which could result in fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution. Although we periodically monitor the compliance of our third-party manufacturers, we cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP or other applicable FDA regulatory requirements.     Controlled Substances
     The CSA and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of distribution for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, labeling, importation, exportation, disposal and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
     Facilities that research, manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substances utilized. For example, separate registrations are required for importation and manufacturing activities, and each registration authorizes which schedules of controlled substances the registrant may handle. However, certain coincident activities are permitted without obtaining a separate DEA registration, such as distribution of controlled substances by the manufacturer that produces them.
     The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules — Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V — with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently “accepted medical use” in treatment in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical 

 
  25

 

supervision. They may be used only in federally‑approved research programs and may not be marketed or sold for dispensing to patients in the United States. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence. The regulatory requirements are more restrictive for Schedule II substances than Schedule III-V substances. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist in most situations, and cannot be refilled. While Cannabis and THC are Schedule I controlled substances, products approved for medical use in the United States that contain Cannabis, THC or Cannabis/THC extracts must be placed in Schedules II‑V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the “acceptable medical use” requirement.
     The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, record keeping, reporting and compliance with other DEA regulatory requirements prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. An application for a manufacturing registration as a bulk manufacturer (not a dosage form manufacturer or a repacker/relabeler) for a Schedule I or II substance must be published in the Federal Register, and is open for 30 days to permit interested persons to submit comments, objections, or requests for a hearing. A copy of the notice of the Federal Register publication is forwarded by the DEA to all those registered, or applicants for registration, as bulk manufacturers of that substance. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must adhere to certain requirements to dispose of controlled substances. As with applications for registration as a bulk manufacturer, an application for an importer registration for a Schedule I or II substance must also be published in the Federal Register, which remains open for 30 days for comments. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance, Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, specially designated Schedule III non-narcotics, or Schedule IV or V narcotic controlled in Schedule I or II by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non‑narcotics.
     For drugs manufactured in the United States, the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. This limited aggregate amount of Cannabis that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, which, in turn, must annually apply to the DEA for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies.
     The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State Authorities, including Boards of Pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.
     We currently manufacture the API for Zygel in the United States and Canada. For Zygel, we are conducting a Phase 2/3 clinical trials for Zygel in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. We may decide to develop, manufacture or 

 
  26

 

commercialize our product candidates in additional countries. As a result, we will also be subject to controlled substance laws and regulations from the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, Health Canada’s Office of Controlled Substances in Canada, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Device Safety Authority in New Zealand, and from other regulatory agencies in other countries where we develop, manufacture or commercialize Zygel in the future. 
     The Hatch‑Waxman Act
     Generic Competition
     Any drug candidates approved for commercial marketing under an NDA would be subject to the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Among other things, the Hatch-Waxman Act establishes two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved NDA products. The first provides that generic versions of an approved product may be approved under an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, by a showing that the generic product is the “same as” the approved product in key respects. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s), same strength, route of administration and dosage form as a previously approved NDA product (the “reference listed drug” or RLD) and has been shown through PK testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “therapeutic equivalents” to the RLD, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the RLD. 505(b)(2) applications are the second approval pathway for follow-on drug products. 505(b)(2) applications are NDAs and must therefore contain full reports of safety and effectiveness data; however, in a 505(b)(2) application at least some of the required data is derived from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. In this regard, a 505(b)(2) application may rely on scientific literature or on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness of an approved RLD. Unlike an ANDA, a 505(b)(2) may be submitted for a product that differs in active ingredient, strength, route of administration, dosage form, or other conditions of use.
     The approval of drug products submitted under these abbreviated approval pathways may be prevented by certain periods of regulatory exclusivity and/or extended patent protection provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act.
     Impact of Listed Patents
     An ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed with the approved RLD in the FDA’s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify: (i) that the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) that the listed patent has expired; (iii) the date that the listed patent will expire; or (iv) that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method of use rather than certify to such listed method of use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents by filing a certification that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
     A certification that the new product will not infringe the RLD’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA holder and patent owner once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder and/or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. If the patent was listed in the Orange Book before submission of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. This regulatory stay is commonly referred to as a “30-month stay.”

 Marketing Exclusivity
     An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application cannot be approved until the expiration of any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the RLD.
     The Hatch-Waxman Act provides certain periods of regulatory exclusivity. These include (1) five years of regulatory exclusivity for a drug product that contains a new chemical entity (NCE), which generally means an active ingredient that contains a novel active moiety; and (2) three years of exclusivity for the approval of an NDA or supplemental NDA that contains data from new clinical investigations that were necessary for approval. Three-year exclusivity prevents FDA from approving a follow-on product with the same conditions of approval for three years. By contrast, NCE exclusivity prevents FDA from accepting for review an application for a follow-on product that contains the protected active moiety during the five-year period dating from the product’s approval. However, if the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application contains a Paragraph IV certification, that application may be submitted four years after approval of the listed drug protected by NCE exclusivity. In that case, if timely patent litigation is filed, the regulatory stay will expire seven and a half years after the approval of the RLD, unless it terminates early based on expiration of the patent, a settlement of the patent litigation, or a decision in the litigation favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.
     If there is no patent listed in the Orange Book with the RLD, there can be no Paragraph IV certification; in these circumstances, no ANDA or 505(b)(2) may be filed before the expiration of the NCE exclusivity period.
     Additionally, six months of marketing exclusivity in the United States is available under Section 505A of the FDC Act if, in response to a written request from the FDA, a sponsor timely submits and the agency accepts reports of requested studies relating to the use of the approved drug in the pediatric population. This six month pediatric exclusivity period is not a standalone exclusivity period, but rather is added to any existing patent or regulatory exclusivity period for which the drug product is eligible. Pediatric exclusivity does not extend the term of the patent; instead, it extends by six months the preclusive effect of the patent on FDA’s authority to approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. Whether pediatric exclusivity will extend a listed patent depends on the type of patent certification provided by the follow-on applicant and the outcome of any associated litigation arising from that certification.
     Patent Term Extension
     The term of a patent that covers an FDA approved drug that contains an active ingredient not previously approved may be eligible for patent term extension, which provides patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the development and FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch‑Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products.     The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
     The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

 European and Other International Government Regulation
     In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the national health authority of each EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
     To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. In the European Union, marketing authorization for a medicinal product can be obtained through a centralized, mutual recognition, decentralized procedure, or the national procedure of an individual EU Member State. In accordance with the centralized procedure, the applicant can submit a single application for marketing authorization to the EMA. The agency will provide a positive opinion regarding the application if it meets certain quality, safety, and efficacy requirements. Following the opinion of the EMA, the European Commission makes a final decision to grant a centralized marketing authorization that permits the marketing of a product in all 28 EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, medicinal products derived from certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and certain other medicinal products containing a new active substance for the treatment of certain diseases. This route is optional for certain other products, including medicinal products that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public or animal health. 
     Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application process is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.
     The mutual recognition procedure is similarly based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.
     For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, Australia or New Zealand, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
     Compliance
     During all phases of development (pre‑ and post‑marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, refusal to accept clinical data from outside the United States, 

 
  29

 

withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Third country authorities can impose equivalent penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
     Data Exclusivity
     In the European Union if a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved.        Orphan Drug Designation
     Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, orphan drug designation may nevertheless be available if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, a drug that has received orphan drug designation is eligible for financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. The Orphan Drug Act provides that, if a designated drug is approved for the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the approved product will be granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA generally may not approve any other application for a product containing the same active moiety for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
     In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life‑threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, orphan drug designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life‑threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug. The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, with a limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the EMA, or the European Commission are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity
    
 
  30

 


 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submission of an application for marketing approval. Products that qualify for orphan designation may also qualify for other FDA programs that are intended to expedite the development and approval process and, as a practical matter, clinical trials for orphan products may be smaller, simply because of the smaller patient population. Nonetheless, the same approval standards apply to orphan-designated products as for other drugs. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
     In August 2017, President Trump signed into law the Food & Drug Administration Reauthorization Act.  This legislation imposes significant new requirements for clinical trial sponsors which will affect, among other things, obtaining orphan drug designation, and the development of drugs and biological products for pediatric use.
     Priority Review, Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Accelerated Approval (United States) 
     The FDA has programs to expedite submission and consideration of certain drug products that address serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. An application for a drug will receive priority review designation if it is for a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review means that FDA will seek to complete its first-cycle review and take action on the application within six months rather than the customary 10-month standard review period. An applicant may request priority review at the time it submits its application. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
     Additionally, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs involving serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. If a drug receives fast track designation, the FDA may consider reviewing sections of the NDA on a rolling basis, rather than requiring the entire application to be submitted to begin the review. Products with fast track designation also may be eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondence with the FDA about the product’s development. Other FDA programs intended to expedite development and review include accelerated approval (i.e., approval on the basis of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit) and breakthrough therapy designation, which is available for drugs under development for serious or life-threatening conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence shows that the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. If a drug receives breakthrough therapy designation, it will be eligible for all of the benefits of fast track designation, as well as for more intensive guidance from the FDA on an efficient drug development program and a commitment from the agency to involve senior FDA managers in such guidance. Even if a product qualifies for fast track designation or breakthrough therapy designation, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for these designations, and/or may determine that the product does not meet the standards for approval.
     Accelerated Review (European Union)
     Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days (excluding “clock stops,” when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest. Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances:  the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life‑threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.     Healthcare Reform
     The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and 

 
  31

 

impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that have been implemented since enactment and are of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs or biologic agents;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the U.S. civil False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2025. 
     There have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act.  For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the repeal will result in over 13 million fewer Americans maintaining their health insurance coverage over the next ten years and is likely to lead to increases in insurance premiums.  
     On January 20, 2017, the President signed an executive order directing federal agencies to exercise existing authorities to reduce burdens associated with the Affordable Care Act pending further action by Congress. In April 2018, CMS issued a final rule and guidance documents which changed requirements for health plans sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces for 2019. These changes include, for example, turning over responsibility for ensuring that marketplace 

 
  32

 

plans have enough health care providers in their networks to the states that rely on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange; allowing states to alter aspects of the essential health benefits required of health plans sold through the federal and state insurance marketplaces; eliminating certain Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) regulatory requirements; and outlining criteria by which insurers may reduce the percentage of income allocated to patient care. The U.S. Department of Labor issued a final rule in June 2018 to expand the availability of association health plans available to small business owners and self-employed individuals, beginning on September 1, 2018. These association health plans will not be required to provide the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. These and other regulations may impact coverage of certain health care services.  
     In 2018, Congress has proposed further legislation to repeal or revise the Affordable Care Act, which if enacted, may have a significant impact on the health care system. We expect that further changes to the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenue. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may compromise our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
     Coverage and Reimbursement
     Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third‑party payors. Third‑party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA approved drugs for a particular indication. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates, if approved, may not be considered medically necessary or cost‑effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third‑party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
     The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the Medicare Modernization Act, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2003, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products, including creating the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products.
     Existing federal law requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates to state governments, based on a statutory formula, on covered outpatient drugs reimbursed by the Medicaid program as a condition of having their drugs paid for by Medicaid. Rebate amounts for a product are determined by a statutory formula that is based on prices defined in the statute: AMP, which must be calculated for all products that are covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid program, and best price, which must be calculated only for those covered outpatient drugs that are a single source drug or innovator multiple source drug, such as biologic products. Manufacturers are required to report AMP and best price for each of their covered outpatient drugs to the government on a regular basis. Additionally, some state Medicaid programs have imposed a requirement for supplemental rebates over and above the formula set forth in federal law, as a condition for coverage. In addition to the Medicaid rebate program, federal law also requires that if a pharmaceutical manufacturer

wishes to have its outpatient drugs covered under Medicaid as well as under Medicare Part B, it must sign a “Master Agreement” obligating it to provide a formulaic discount of approximately 24% known as the federal ceiling price for drugs sold to the U.S. Departments of Defense (including the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Veterans Affairs, the Public Health Service and the Coast Guard, and also provide discounts through a drug pricing agreement meeting the requirements of Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act, for outpatient drugs sold to certain specified eligible healthcare organizations. The formula for determining the discounted purchase price under the 340B drug pricing program is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and rebate amount for a particular product as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above.
     Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, each EU Member States can restrict the range of medicinal products for which its national health insurance system provides reimbursement and can control the prices of medicinal products for human use marketed on its territory. As a result, following receipt of marketing authorization in an EU Member State, through any application route, the applicant is required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with the competent pricing authority in the individual EU Member State. The governments of the EU Member States influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers.  Some EU Member States operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost‑effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Others adopt a system of reference pricing, basing the price or reimbursement level in their territories either on the pricing and reimbursement levels in other countries or on the pricing and reimbursement levels of medicinal products intended for the same therapeutic indication. Further, some EU Member States approve a specific price for the medicinal product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, we may face competition for our product candidates from lower‑priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross‑border imports from low‑priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
     Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products, however, is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States. These EU Member States include the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.
     The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product varies between EU Member States.
     In addition, pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU Member States was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This may lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTAs between EU Member States and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and may negatively affect price in at least some EU Member States.
     The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third‑party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on 

 
  34

 

pharmaceutical pricing. With few exceptions (e.g., limitations on Medicare Part D sponsors concerning certain formulary changes), coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
     Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
     Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
     In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to additional regulation, particularly once third-party reimbursement becomes available for one or more of our products, by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of HHS (for example, the Office of Inspector General), the DOJ and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments.
     The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti‑Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti‑Kickback Statute was broadened by the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
     The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and reached substantial financial settlements under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non‑reimbursable, uses. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs. 
     The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
     The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to 

 
  35

 

physicians and teaching hospitals and public reporting of the payment data. Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to track such payments, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year.
     Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to certain health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct.
     In addition, we are subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we potentially could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity (e.g., a healthcare provider or a health plan) in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. 
     To the extent that we continue to conduct clinical trials or seek to commercialize our products outside of the United States, we will also be subject to a variety of foreign data protection laws and regulations. For example, in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. For our clinical trials in Australia, to the extent that the sites for our trials include certain university, company or government agencies, we may be subject to restrictions and data protection obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).  We may, otherwise, be subject to additional data protection laws in Australia in the states and territories in which we conduct our trials, which have similar restrictions on our ability to collect, analyze and transfer medical records and other patient data.
     Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre‑marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

     In addition, at the federal level, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, regulates the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs. The DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in prescription drug distribution, for example, it requires manufacturers to affix a product identifier to each package and case of a prescription drug product intended for sale by November 27, 2017. A product identifier is an electronically-readable graphic that contains information including the product’s unique numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date. The DSCA also requires relevant parties and to identify and remove illegitimate products from the market, including products that are counterfeit, stolen, intentionally contaminated, or otherwise harmful. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act, its implementing regulations and state laws also regulate the distribution of prescription drug product samples.
     In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state law requirements for registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products, including, in some states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Several states, and more recently some large cities, have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, register their sales representatives, and/or limit other specified sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
     Scientific Advisors 
     We have established a clinical advisory board and we regularly seek advice and input from these experienced clinical leaders on matters related to our research and development programs. The members of our clinical advisory board consist of experts across a range of key disciplines relevant to our programs. We intend to continue to leverage the broad expertise of our advisors by seeking their counsel on important topics relating to our product development and clinical development programs. Our scientific advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our clinical advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours. All of our clinical advisors are affiliated with other entities and devote only a small portion of their time to us.

     Employees
     As of March 7, 2019, we had 25 full-time employees. In addition to our full‑time employees, we contract with third‑parties for the conduct of certain preclinical, manufacturing, accounting and administrative activities. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and none are represented by labor unions.     Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
     We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. For as long as we remain an “emerging growth company”, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various disclosure and reporting 

 
  38

 

requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to:
    
· | an exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, including no Compensation Disclosure and Analysis;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an exemption from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering (b) in which we have annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be an accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of the prior second quarter and (2) the date on which we have , during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities.
     We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Report and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
     The JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.”
