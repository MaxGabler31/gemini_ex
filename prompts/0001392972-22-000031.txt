On November 30, 2021, we acquired EveryMundo LLC ("EveryMundo"), a privately held company based in Miami, Florida. EveryMundo is a digital offer marketing pioneer that enables brands to broaden their digital reach and deepen customer engagement, pulling a brand's customers into the brand's direct selling channels to help create superior brand experiences and foster brand loyalty over time.
Our Industry
    Real-time decision making is an important driver of business performance in the digital economy. Rapidly changing markets and buyer expectations make it increasingly harder for companies to compete and grow. In response to these pressures, we believe that market forces, including increasingly dynamic and complex business models, the continued growth of eCommerce, and the exponential increase in the volume of enterprise and market data will increase demand for software solutions that enable companies to dynamically price, configure and sell their products and services across an ever-increasing set of buyer channels with speed, precision and consistency. We believe the market for solutions that can power commerce using AI and machine learning is a large, growing market that spans most major industries.
Our Solutions
    Our cloud-based software solutions, built on the PROS Platform, provide companies with AI-based predictive and prescriptive guidance on key business decisions that drive growth and profitability. We focus primarily on configure price quote ("CPQ"), pricing optimization and management, airline revenue optimization, airline distribution and retail, and digital offer marketing software Our solutions help increase visibility, business agility and customer engagement by aligning sales and pricing strategy across go-to-market channels.
    PROS Platform 
We believe the PROS Platform is the only unified pricing and selling platform built for an omnichannel world. The PROS Platform enables businesses to create greater margin and grow revenue by dynamically adapting their digital selling strategy to market conditions and disruption. Using our unique and proven AI-based capabilities for deep demand and margin forecasting, cost modeling and dynamic pricing, the PROS Platform continuously feeds daily decision-making and longer-term business strategy. The PROS Platform helps eliminate barriers between stakeholders in the selling process to collaborate on a customer offer and drive it to a close while accelerating pricing and selling efficiencies. The PROS Platform is comprised of PROS Smart Configure Price Quote and PROS Smart Price Optimization and Management, and is offered via composable paths based on our customers' business objectives, ranging from simple to advanced use cases with the ability to scale to broader PROS Platform capabilities over time. 
PROS Smart Configure Price Quote is designed to improve sales productivity and accelerate deal velocity by automating common sales tasks. Utilizing a foundation of AI and machine learning algorithms, this solution empowers businesses to tailor every offer for every buyer, across all sales channels, leading to more personalized and engaging customer interactions.

Technology
Our high-performance software architecture supports real-time, high-volume transaction processing and enables us to handle the complex and demanding processing requirements of sophisticated global enterprises, including those who require sub-second response times for their customers. We provide the majority of our cloud services via cloud computing platform partners who offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service ("IaaS") and Platform-as-a-Service ("PaaS"), located in the United States, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, United Arab Emirates, Australia, Singapore and other countries. The use of cloud computing platform partners provides us flexibility to service customers at scale and also offers options to comply with data residency and privacy requirements. We also deliver our solutions from infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within third-party data center facilities. Our Platform consists of single-tenant and multi-tenant cloud capabilities.
Artificial Intelligence. More than three decades of data science research and access to very large data sets underlies the robust machine learning and AI capabilities of our solutions. Our dynamic AI, including forecasting, optimization, neural networks, segmentation and reinforcement learning, allows us to leverage our deep science and research expertise in our solutions. These capabilities are industry-independent and are validated using our proprietary verification and testing processes.
Configuration and Extensibility. Our solutions are designed to handle customer business needs through self-service configuration rather than custom code. The configuration capabilities define both a business layer (including definition of user workflows, executive dashboards, analytics views, calculations, approval processes and alerts), as well as a data layer that permits configuration of data structures, including hierarchical dimensions, pricing levels and measures. We maintain our customers' configurations which allows them to use the latest version of our solutions. We also offer capabilities where scripting languages can be used to handle business requirements that are unique to individual customers. In addition, our solutions are extensible through API's, which allows for broader and richer commerce solutions to be developed with our Platform as a core component.
Data Integration. The data needed to execute and power personalized digital buying typically resides in multiple sources, such as a company's enterprise resource planning ("ERP"), supply chain management ("SCM"), customer relationship management ("CRM"), eCommerce, reservations and inventory systems, external market data sources, spreadsheets and/or industry-specific transaction systems. Our platform interoperates with many different systems, including those that have been heavily customized to customer requirements. Our data integration capabilities bring data from disparate sources together into a single cohesive data platform, both in real time and through scheduled batch tasks. We also provide certified integration content for SAP and integration development services using industry standard tools and adapters for other common data sources and applications.
Microservices Architecture and Scalability. Our architecture contains multiple microservices in key areas. This allows for the reliability and performance necessary for real-time pricing, availability and eCommerce applications. To achieve this, we rely on industry-standard container orchestration tools, noSQL and Event Store technologies to provide high availability, redundancy, zero-downtime upgrades, horizontal scalability and geographic distribution of data.
User Interface. Our technology provides a rich and modern, browser-based interface that supports a global user base. This interface supports a wide variety of interactive charts and other data views and provides a comprehensive security model based on user role and scope of responsibility. This interface operates on a variety of internet browsers, mobile devices and tablets. We also provide native capabilities for a variety of commerce systems including Adobe Magento, Salesforce CRM and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
Subscription Services
    Our subscription services provide customers access to our software via the Internet which, as compared to an on-premises software model, helps reduce their infrastructure, installation and ongoing administration requirements. We also reduce the total cost of ownership of our cloud services over the subscription term by delivering multiple feature releases per year that automatically introduce new features, while preserving previous configurations and integrations that minimize additional customer investment for compatibility. We also provide cloud-based services to allow existing customers who previously purchased licenses to our legacy software to have access to that software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage. 
Sales, Marketing and Customer Success
    We sell and market our software solutions primarily through our direct global sales force and indirectly through go-to-market partners, resellers and systems integrators. Our sales force is organized by our target markets, including automotive and industrial manufacturing, transportation and logistics, chemicals and energy, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech and travel. Our marketing activities consist of a variety of programs designed to generate sales leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build awareness of our solutions. We also use digital channels including search and content syndication to reach our target market. We host an annual customer conference, Outperform, where our customers and prospects are invited to learn about best practices from thought leaders, executives and other practitioners in using technology to compete in the digital economy, hear about our latest innovations, and network with peers across industries. We also host other smaller conferences throughout the year, host informational web seminars and participate in and sponsor other industry and trade conferences and organizations. We believe that customer adoption, support and success are critical to retaining and expanding our customer base. Our customer success team helps ensure customer satisfaction with our solutions, by working with our customers to ensure that our solutions drive value for them in order to drive customer retention. Our customer success teams help our customers drive adoption of our solutions, advise on product features and capabilities, and provide recommendations on best practices to meet our customers' business objectives.
Professional Services
    To accelerate our customers' time to value, we provide software-related services, including implementation, configuration, consulting and training services. We offer in-depth expertise, proven best practices and repeatable delivery methodologies based on standardized and tested implementation processes developed through years of experience implementing our software solutions in global enterprises across multiple industries. We also offer an array of training on all aspects of our software solutions, from introductory on-demand mini-courses to multi-day hands-on deep technical classroom sessions. In addition to our own internal services team, we also work with many globally diverse third-party system integrators who have been certified to implement our software.
Maintenance and Support
Customers maintaining implementations under on-premises licenses that were purchased prior to our cloud transition may purchase, at their discretion, maintenance and support services. Maintenance enrollment entitles a customer to solicit support through a web-based interface to submit and track issues, access our online knowledge base, and receive unspecified upgrades, maintenance releases and bug fixes during the term of the support period. Revenue from maintenance and support services has continued to decline as a percentage of our total revenue since we transitioned to our cloud strategy and sold fewer on-premises licenses to our software. We expect our maintenance revenue to continue to decrease as more existing customers migrate from our legacy on-premises solutions to our cloud solutions. 
Customers
We sell our solutions to customers across many industries, including automotive and industrial manufacturing, transportation and logistics, chemicals and energy, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech and travel. Our customers are generally large global enterprises and medium-sized businesses, although we also have customers that are smaller in scope of operations. In 2021, we had no single customer that accounted for 10% or more of our revenue. Our customers are also geographically diverse, as approximately 65% of our total revenue came from customers outside the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Competition
The markets for our solutions are competitive, fragmented and rapidly evolving. For example, we have seen consolidation in the CPQ software market with large vendors acquiring smaller CPQ companies as they attempt to provide end-to-end solutions. Today, we compete in a sales ecosystem with competitors that aim to drive effectiveness and efficiency in selling, although we believe we are unmatched in our ability to deliver sales and pricing AI with usability, speed, scale and precision. We face competition from both larger and smaller competitors, including those providing industry specific software, a portion of our pricing solutions, our CPQ solutions, and a portion of our revenue management, retail, shopping and merchandising solutions in the airline industry. To a lesser extent, we compete against large enterprise application providers that have developed offerings that include competing functionality and custom solutions developed internally by businesses, which generally include some combination of spreadsheets, manual processes, external consultants and internally developed software tools.
The number of companies that we compete with has increased as we expanded into adjacent technologies. We believe our customers consider the following factors when evaluating our solutions versus competitive solutions: 
•breadth and depth of product and service offerings, including functionality, performance, product architecture, data security, reliability and scalability;
•user experience;
•return on investment, total cost of ownership and time-to-value;
•applicability for all current and future selling channels;
•customer base and reputation;
•brand awareness;
•strength of AI and real-time capabilities;
•breadth and depth of integrations with the software already used by the customer;
•depth of expertise in data and pricing science; and
•industry domain expertise and functionality.
We believe that none of our competitors can provide a competitive level of all the functionality needed to support an organization interested in optimizing sales growth through AI-based omnichannel pricing, selling and revenue management. Our competitors generally compete on price or by bundling their applications with other enterprise applications, and we expect that this will continue in the future. We distinguish ourselves from these vendors through our long history of providing software solutions incorporating AI and/or machine learning, the breadth and depth of the functionality we offer, the robust integration and configuration capabilities of our solutions, our ability to handle large data volumes at scale and our proven ability to provide high-value dynamic science-based optimization software to our global customer base across industries. In the future, we believe our competition will continue to increase as we expand into adjacent market segments.
Intellectual Property 
Our success and ability to compete is dependent, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We protect our intellectual property with a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, patents, trademarks, copyrights and other similar measures. We believe that reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how are generally the most advantageous methods for us to protect our proprietary information.
Research and Development
We believe our software innovation is the foundation of our business and accordingly have made, and continue to make, significant investments in research and development for the enhancement of existing solutions and the development of solutions. We also believe that our long-term investments in AI and machine learning to power pricing and revenue management differentiate us from our competitors. We are committed to continuing the further development of these high-value solutions as evidenced by our continued investment in research and development. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, we incurred expenses of $82.3 million and $77.2 million, respectively, which is over 30% of our annual revenue, in research and development, net of capitalized internal-use software cost, to enhance our existing portfolio of solutions and to develop new solutions. Our research and development expenses include costs associated with our product management, product development and science and research groups. We conduct research and development activities predominantly in Bulgaria, France and the U.S., and also utilize third-party contractors in various countries, including Bolivia, Canada, Colombia, France, India, Romania and Mexico.
We employ data scientists, many of whom are Ph.D.'s, to advance sales, pricing and revenue management technology and its implementation in our software solutions. These scientists have specialties including, but not limited to, AI, machine learning, operations research, management science, statistics, econometrics and computational methods. Our data scientists regularly interact with our customers, product development, sales, marketing and services teams to help keep our science efforts relevant to real-world demands.
Human Capital Resources
Our mission is to help people and companies outperform. To fulfill that mission, we believe we must attract, develop, motivate and retain exceptional employees to maintain our culture and uphold our high ethical standards. As innovation is one of our core values, we believe that our commitment to innovation begins with our commitment to create an environment where our employees can thrive and reach their full potential. To accomplish this, we offer competitive total rewards, promote diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, invest in ongoing learning and development, and focus on the future of work. Oversight of our approach to and investment in human capital resources is a key governance matter for our Board of Directors ("Board"). Directly, and through its Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, the Board engages regularly with management on human capital matters. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,545 full-time personnel, which included 1,293 employees and 252 outsourced personnel. Our team spans 15+ countries, reflecting various backgrounds, ages, gender identities and ethnicities.
Culture. At PROS, our values and culture are embedded in everything we do. We proactively look for ways to maintain our collaborative and open company culture and further improve our organizational health, including through regular employee and management communication, periodic team events and frequent employee pulse surveys. We use insights from employee feedback, including through town halls, leader forums and other communication channels, to inform our human capital resources plans. PROS has been Certified™ by Great Place to Work® for the second year in a row, which shows the impact of our efforts. This year’s designation extends our prior certification to all eligible countries, recognizing our inclusive, people-first culture on a global scale. We encourage you to visit our website for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Total Rewards. We require a talented workforce to drive innovation, operational excellence and long-term stockholder value. We also believe that employees should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race or other personal characteristics, and we constantly strive for pay parity. We define pay parity as ensuring that employees in the same job and location are paid fairly regardless of their gender or ethnicity. To attract and retain a talented workforce, we provide total rewards programs, practices and policies designed to be market-competitive, including by benchmarking and setting pay ranges based on market data, and also considering factors such as an employee’s role, skills, experience, job location and performance. We have invested in analysis and transparency to demonstrate our commitment to fair compensation and opportunity.
Our human resources management philosophy goes beyond traditional compensation and benefits. We design our total rewards to meet the needs of the whole person, not just the employee, recognizing that life events and circumstances that occur outside of work may impact what happens at work. For example, we provide a trusted time off approach in the U.S. to give employees more flexibility and control over their schedules. Our investments in employee mental health and wellness programs are also cornerstones of this philosophy. In response to the multitude of work and personal challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and as we transition to the future of work, we added specific employee well-being initiatives which are discussed below.
Diversity and Inclusion. We believe diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging ("DEIB") drive innovation and ownership. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a skilled and diverse Board which provides oversight for our human capital resources efforts, including our DEIB programs and initiatives. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of our Board was comprised of either female and/or ethnically diverse directors, with both female and ethnically diverse representation on our Board for more than 10 years. As of December 31, 2021, women represent 36% of our global employees, and in the U.S., more than 50% of our employees represent minority groups, with underrepresented minorities (defined as those who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander and/or two or more races) representing 26% of our U.S. employees. 

We strive to maintain a working environment that celebrates diverse perspectives, cultures and experiences and invest in programs to engage our employees, including diversity, inclusion and harassment training. We have a heritage of fostering inclusion and belonging, awareness and education, and social interaction and camaraderie through our employee resource groups. Sponsored and funded by PROS, these employee-led groups are open to any interested employee and create spaces for our people to connect from all walks of life, grow together and build relationships and community. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance DEIB, but we recognize we still have work to do, including how we approach the future of work. 
Additional information on our diversity and inclusion strategy, diversity metrics and programs can be found on our website at pros.com/about-pros/diversity-and-inclusion. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Future of Work. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we initially instituted a work-from-home policy for substantially all our employees and materially limited business travel. As the pandemic has brought on systemic changes to historic work habits, we have embraced a hybrid work model with an eye on the future of work. As part of this hybrid model, we emphasize flexibility, including in work location and work schedules, based on a blend of what makes sense for each employee, their team, and our business. In addition, we continue to take an integrated approach to helping our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on employee physical and mental health. Recognizing that working in a hybrid environment across our global company is a relatively new way to interact, we offer company-wide initiatives to assist our employees in managing through the changes, including productivity, mental and physical health programming, periodic recharge days and "wellness Wednesdays" with limited scheduled meetings. Additional information on our hybrid work model, pandemic response and related wellness initiatives will be included in our 2022 Proxy Statement.
Learning and Development. We believe that continuous learning cultivates innovation and that the development of our most important assets, our people, is foundational to fulfill our mission. We regularly invest in our employees’ career growth and provide our employees opportunities for training on a wide range of skills designed to help them be more effective in their current and future roles. In 2021, all our employees participated in learning and development activities, including thousands of courses across a broad range of categories – leadership, inclusion and diversity, professional skills, technical and compliance. Because the development of our employees and next generation of leaders is critical to our long-term success, we annually engage in a comprehensive talent evaluation and succession planning process, including manager evaluations of all employees and detailed succession planning for all director and above roles with Board oversight for senior management and other key roles. As of December 31, 2021, 90% of our managers have completed a leadership training program we developed in partnership with the Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University.
