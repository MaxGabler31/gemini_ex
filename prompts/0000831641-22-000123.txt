Reportable Segments
We manage our operations under two reportable segments. Our Government Services Group ("GSG") reportable segment primarily includes activities with U.S. government clients (federal, state and local) and all activities with development agencies worldwide. Our Commercial/International Services Group ("CIG") reportable segment primarily includes activities with U.S. commercial clients and international clients other than development agencies. These reportable segments allow us to capitalize on our growing market opportunities and enhance the development of high-end consulting and technical solutions to meet our growing client demand. We continue to report the historical results of the wind-down of our non-core construction activities in the Remediation and Construction Management ("RCM") reportable segment. There has been no remaining backlog for RCM since fiscal 2018 as the projects were complete. 
Beginning of fiscal 2022, we aligned our operations to better serve our clients and markets, and created a new High Performance Buildings ("HPB") division in the CIG reportable segment. As a result, we transferred some related operations in the GSG reportable segment to the CIG reportable segment. Prior year amounts for reportable segments have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
The following table presents the percentage of our revenue by reportable segment: 

 | Fiscal Year
Reportable Segment | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 
GSG | 52.0% | 55.2% | 52.7% 
CIG | 49.6 | 46.7 | 49.1 
Inter-segment elimination | (1.6) | (1.9) | (1.8) 
 | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0%

Clients
We provide services to a diverse base of U.S. federal government, U.S. state and local government, U.S. commercial and international clients. The following table presents the percentage of our revenue by client sector:

 | Fiscal Year
Client Sector | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 
U.S. federal government (1) | 30.4% | 33.6% | 33.2% 
U.S. state and local government | 17.2 | 16.7 | 14.7 
U.S. commercial | 21.4 | 19.9 | 22.5 
International (2) | 31.0 | 29.8 | 29.6 
 | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0%

(1) Includes revenue generated under U.S. federal government contracts performed outside the United States.
(2) Includes revenue generated from foreign operations, primarily in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and revenue generated from non-U.S. clients.
U.S. federal government agencies are significant clients. The U.S. Agency for International Development ("USAID") accounted for 11.0%, 11.7% and 12.2% of our revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Department of Defense ("DoD") accounted for 9.7%, 11.2% and 9.2% of our revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We typically support multiple programs within a single U.S. federal government agency, both domestically and internationally. We also assist U.S. state and local government clients in various jurisdictions across the United States. Our international clients are primarily focused in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, and consist of a relatively equal sized mix of government and commercial clients. Our U.S. commercial clients include companies in the chemical, energy, mining, pharmaceutical, retail, aerospace, automotive, petroleum and communications industries. No single client, except for the U.S. federal government clients, accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2022.
Contracts 
Our services are performed under three principal types of contracts with our clients: fixed-price, time-and-materials and cost-plus. The following table presents the percentage of our revenue by contract type:

 | Fiscal Year
Contract Type | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 
Fixed-price | 37.6% | 37.1% | 36.0% 
Time-and-materials | 46.7 | 46.4 | 46.5 
Cost-plus | 15.7 | 16.5 | 17.5 
 | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0%

Under a fixed-price contract, clients agree to pay a specified price for our performance of the entire contract or a specified portion of the contract. Some fixed-price contracts can include date-certain and/or performance obligations. Fixed-price contracts carry certain inherent risks, including risks of losses from underestimating costs, delays in project completion, problems with new technologies, price increases for materials and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Consequently, the profitability of fixed-price contracts may vary substantially. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and paid for other expenses. Profitability on these contracts is driven by billable headcount and cost control. Many of our time-and-materials contracts are subject to maximum contract values and, accordingly, revenue related to these contracts is recognized as if these contracts were fixed-price contracts. Under our cost-plus contracts, some of which are subject to a contract ceiling amount, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and fees, which may be fixed or performance-based. If our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable, we may not be able to obtain full reimbursement. Further, the amount of the fee received for a cost-plus award fee contract partially depends upon the client's discretionary periodic assessment of our performance on that contract.
Some contracts with the U.S. federal government are subject to annual funding approval. U.S. federal government agencies may impose spending restrictions that limit the continued funding of our existing contracts and may limit our ability to obtain additional contracts. These limitations, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on us. All contracts with the U.S. federal government may be terminated by the government at any time, with or without cause.
U.S. federal government agencies have formal policies against continuing or awarding contracts that would create actual or potential conflicts of interest with other activities of a contractor. These policies may prevent us from bidding for or performing government contracts resulting from or related to certain work we have performed. In addition, services performed for a commercial or government sector client may create conflicts of interest that preclude or limit our ability to obtain work for a private organization. We attempt to identify actual or potential conflicts of interest and to minimize the possibility that such conflicts could affect our work under current contracts or our ability to compete for future contracts. We have, on occasion, declined to bid on a project because of an existing or potential conflict of interest.
Some of our operating units have contracts with the U.S. federal government that are subject to audit by the government, primarily the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA"). The DCAA generally seeks to (i) identify and evaluate all activities that contribute to, or have an impact on, proposed or incurred costs of government contracts; (ii) evaluate a contractor's policies, procedures, controls and performance; and (iii) prevent or avoid wasteful, careless and inefficient production or service. To accomplish this, the DCAA examines our internal control systems, management policies and financial capability; evaluates the accuracy, reliability and reasonableness of our cost representations and records; and assesses our compliance with Cost Accounting Standards ("CAS") and defective-pricing clauses found within the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR"). The DCAA also performs an annual review of our overhead rates and assists in the establishment of our final rates. This review focuses on the allowability of cost items and the applicability of CAS. The DCAA also audits cost-based contracts, including the close-out of those contracts.
The DCAA reviews all types of U.S. federal government proposals, including those of award, administration, modification and re-pricing. The DCAA considers our cost accounting system, estimating methods and procedures and specific 
proposal requirements. Operational audits are also performed by the DCAA. A review of our operations at every major organizational level is conducted during the proposal review period. During the course of its audit, the U.S. federal government may disallow certain costs if it determines that we accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with CAS. Under a government contract, only those costs that are reasonable, allocable and allowable are recoverable. A disallowance of costs by the U.S. federal government could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
In accordance with our corporate policies, we maintain controls to minimize any occurrence of fraud or other unlawful activities that could result in severe legal remedies, including the payment of damages and/or penalties, criminal and civil sanctions and debarment. In addition, we maintain preventative audit programs and mitigation measures to ensure that appropriate control systems are in place.
We provide services under contracts, purchase orders or retainer letters. Our policy requires that all contracts must be in writing. We bill our clients in accordance with the contract terms and periodically based on costs incurred, on either an hourly-fee basis or on a percentage-of-completion basis, as the project progresses. Most of our agreements permit our clients to terminate the agreements without cause upon payment of fees and expenses through the date of the termination. Generally, our contracts do not require that we provide performance bonds. If required, a performance bond, issued by a surety company, guarantees a contractor's performance under the contract. If the contractor defaults under the contract, the surety will, at its discretion, complete the job or pay the client the amount of the bond. If the contractor does not have a performance bond and defaults in the performance of a contract, the contractor is responsible for all damages resulting from the breach of contract. These damages include the cost of completion, together with possible consequential damages such as lost profits.
Growth Strategy
Our management team establishes Tetra Tech's overall business strategy. Our strategic plan defines and guides our investment in marketing and business development to leverage our differentiators and target priority programs and growth markets. We maintain centralized business development resources to develop our corporate branding and marketing materials, support proposal preparation and planning, conduct market research and manage promotional and professional activities, including appearances at trade shows, advertising and public relations.
We have established company-wide growth initiatives that reinforce internal coordination, track the development of new programs, identify and coordinate collective resources for major bids and help us build interdisciplinary teams and provide innovative solutions for major pursuits. Our growth initiatives provide a forum for cross-sector collaboration, access to technical solutions and the development of interdisciplinary solutions. We continuously identify new markets that are consistent with our strategic plan and service offerings, and we leverage our full-service capabilities and internal coordination structure to develop and implement strategies to research, anticipate and position us for future procurements and emerging programs. Our Tetra Tech Delta program facilitates access and exchange of technology solutions across our company, through the use of internal training, inventories and facilitated virtual networking events.
Business development activities are implemented by our technical and professional management staff throughout Tetra Tech with the support of company-wide resources and expertise. Our project managers and technical staff have the best understanding of our clients' needs and the effect of client-specific issues, local laws and regulations and procurement procedures. Our professional staff members hold frequent meetings with existing and potential clients; give presentations to civic and professional organizations and present seminars on research and technical applications. Effective development of business is facilitated by each staff member's access to all of our service offerings through our internal Tetra Tech Delta and geographic networks. Our strong internal networking programs help our professional staff members to pursue new opportunities for both existing and new clients. These networks also facilitate our ability to provide services throughout the project life cycle from the early studies to operations and maintenance. Networking is further supported by our enterprise-wide knowledge management systems which include skills search tools, business development tracking and collaboration tools.
To support our growth plans, we actively attract, recruit and retain key hires. Our combination of high-end science and consulting coupled with practical applications provides challenging and rewarding opportunities for our associates, thereby enhancing our ability to recruit and retain top quality talent. Our internal networking programs, leadership training, entrepreneurial environment, focus on Leading with Science® and global project portfolio help to attract and retain highly qualified individuals.
Our strategic growth plans are augmented by our selective investment in acquisitions aligned with our business. Acquisitions advance plans to add new technologies, broaden our service offerings, add contract capacity and expand our geographic presence. Our long-established experience in identifying and integrating acquisitions strengthens our ability to integrate and rapidly leverage the resources of the acquired companies post-acquisition.
Sustainability Program
Tetra Tech supports clients in more than 100 countries around the world, helping them to solve complex problems and achieve solutions that are technically, socially and economically resilient. Our high-end consulting and engineering services 
focus on using innovative technologies and creative solutions to minimize environmental impacts and enhance social systems. Our greatest contribution toward sustainability is through the projects we perform every day for our clients, including recycling freshwater supplies, recycling waste products and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In developing countries, we also support gender equality programs, strengthen land tenure and increase climate resiliency and adaptation. As a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact ("UNGC") on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption, Tetra Tech embraces the UNGC Ten Principles as part of the strategy, culture and daily operations of our company.
Our Sustainability Program enhances our commitment by focusing on the environmental, social and governance impact of our business via four primary pillars: Projects – the solutions we provide for our clients; Procurement – our procurement and subcontracting approaches; Processes – the internal policies and processes that promote sustainable practices, reduce costs and minimize environmental impacts; and People – the 21,000 staff at Tetra Tech and our partners, clients and communities worldwide. Our overarching goal is to improve the lives of one billion people by 2030. Because our biggest impact on the world is through the projects we perform for our clients, we are tracking the total number of lives improved from our projects. We align our project impact analysis with the Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI") standards and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ("SDG's"), which measure social benefit and aim to reduce poverty in communities around the world. In addition to our 1 Billion People Challenge, we report on our operational greenhouse gas emissions associated with Scope 1, 2 and 3 CO2e emissions. We also report on human capital metrics that align with our commitment to developing a thriving employee community, including gender balance, racial and ethnic diversity in our workforce, employee engagement and professional development.
Our Sustainability Program is led by our Chief Sustainability Officer, who has been appointed by our Board of Directors and is supported by other key corporate and operations representatives via our Sustainability Council. We continuously implement sustainability-related policies and practices and assess the results of our efforts in order to improve upon them in the future. Tetra Tech's Board of Directors Strategic Planning and Enterprise Risk Management Committee reviews and approves the Sustainability Program and evaluates our progress in achieving the goals and objectives outlined in our plan. As part of the UNGC, we fulfill the annual Communication on Progress via Tetra Tech's Sustainability Report Card that is published on Earth Day. Tetra Tech also participates in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Corporate Sustainability Assessment.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions.    We continuously evaluate the marketplace for acquisition opportunities to further our strategic growth plans. Due to our reputation, size, financial resources, geographic presence and range of services, we have numerous opportunities to acquire privately and publicly held companies or selected portions of such companies. We evaluate an acquisition opportunity based on its ability to strengthen our leadership in the markets we serve, the technologies and solutions they provide and the additional new geographies and clients they bring. Also, during our evaluation, we examine an acquisition's ability to drive organic growth, its accretive effect on long-term earnings and its ability to generate return on investment. Generally, we proceed with an acquisition if we believe that it will strategically expand our service offerings, improve our long-term financial performance and increase shareholder returns.
We view acquisitions as a key component in the execution of our growth strategy, and we intend to use cash, debt or equity, as we deem appropriate, to fund acquisitions. We may acquire other businesses that we believe are synergistic and will ultimately increase our revenue and net income, strengthen our ability to achieve our strategic goals, provide critical mass with existing clients and further expand our lines of service. We typically pay a purchase price that results in the recognition of goodwill, generally representing the intangible value of a successful business with an assembled workforce specialized in our areas of interest. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. All acquisitions require the approval of our Board of Directors. For detailed information regarding acquisitions, see Note 5, "Acquisitions" of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8.
Divestitures. We regularly review and evaluate our existing operations to determine whether our business model should change through the divestiture of certain businesses. Accordingly, from time to time, we may divest or wind-down certain non-core businesses and reallocate our resources to businesses that better align with our long-term strategic direction.

We perform a broad spectrum of consulting, engineering and technical services across the water, environment, sustainable infrastructure, renewable energy and international development markets. Our client base includes U.S. federal government agencies such as USAID, the DoD, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE"), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the FAA; U.S. state and local government agencies; government and commercial clients in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom; the U.S. commercial sector, which consists primarily of large 
industrial companies and utilities; and our international commercial clients. Our competition varies and is a function of the business areas in which, and the client sectors for which, we perform our services. The number of competitors for any procurement can vary widely, depending upon technical qualifications, the relative value of the project, geographic location, the financial terms and risks associated with the work and any restrictions placed upon competition by the client. Historically, clients have chosen among competing firms by weighing the quality, innovation and timeliness of the firm's service versus its cost to determine which firm offers the best value. When less work becomes available in certain markets, price could become an increasingly important factor.
Our competitors vary depending on end markets and clients, and often we may only compete with a portion of a firm. We believe that our principal competitors include the following firms, in alphabetical order: AECOM; Arcadis NV; Black & Veatch Corporation; Booz Allen Hamilton; Brown & Caldwell; CDM Smith Inc.; Chemonics International, Inc.; Exponent, Inc.; GHD; ICF International, Inc.; Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.; Leidos, Inc.; SAIC; SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.; Stantec Inc.; TRC Companies, Inc.; Weston Solutions, Inc.; and WSP Global Inc.
Backlog 
We include in our backlog only those contracts for which funding has been provided and work authorization has been received. We estimate that approximately two-thirds of our backlog at the end of fiscal 2022 will be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2023, as work is being performed. However, we cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. In addition, project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog. For example, certain of our contracts with the U.S. federal government and other clients are terminable at the discretion of the client, with or without cause. These types of backlog reductions could adversely affect our revenue and margins. Accordingly, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.
Our backlog at fiscal 2022 year-end was $3.7 billion, an increase of $264 million, or 7.6%, compared to fiscal 2021 year-end. Of this amount, GSG and CIG reported $2.3 billion and $1.5 billion of backlog, respectively, at fiscal 2022 year-end. 
Regulations 
We engage in various service activities that are subject to government oversight, including environmental laws and regulations, general government procurement laws and regulations and other regulations and requirements imposed by the specific government agencies with which we conduct business.
Environmental. A significant portion of our business involves the planning, design and program management of pollution control facilities, as well as the assessment and management of remediation activities at hazardous waste sites, U.S. Superfund sites and military bases. In addition, we contract with U.S. federal government entities to destroy hazardous materials. These activities require us to manage, handle, remove, treat, transport and dispose of toxic or hazardous substances.
Some environmental laws, such as the U.S. Superfund law and similar state, provincial and local statutes, can impose liability for the entire cost of clean-up for contaminated facilities or sites upon present and former owners and operators, as well as generators, transporters and persons arranging for the treatment or disposal of such substances. In addition, while we strive to handle hazardous and toxic substances with care and in accordance with safe methods, the possibility of accidents, leaks, spills and events of force majeure always exist. Humans exposed to these materials, including workers or subcontractors engaged in the transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and persons in affected areas, may be injured or become ill. This could result in lawsuits that expose us to liability and substantial damage awards. Liabilities for contamination or human exposure to hazardous or toxic materials, or a failure to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury or the cessation of remediation activities.
Certain of our business operations are covered by U.S. Public Law 85-804, which provides for government indemnification against claims and damages arising out of unusually hazardous activities performed at the request of the government. Due to changes in public policies and law, however, government indemnification may not be available in the case of any future claims or liabilities relating to other hazardous activities that we perform.
Government Procurement.    The services we provide to the U.S. federal government are subject to the FAR and other rules and regulations applicable to government contracts. These rules and regulations:
•require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with the contract negotiations under certain contract types;
•impose accounting rules that define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based government contracts; and
•restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.
In addition, services provided to the DoD and U.S. federal civil agencies are monitored by the Defense Contract Management Agency and audited by the DCAA. Our government clients can also terminate any of their contracts, and many of our government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually. Further, the services we provide to state and local government clients are subject to various government rules and regulations.
Seasonality
We experience seasonal trends in our business. Our revenue and operating income are typically lower in the first half of our fiscal year, primarily due to the Thanksgiving (in the U.S. and Canada), Christmas and New Year's holidays. Many of our clients' employees, as well as our own employees, take vacations during these holiday periods. Further, seasonal inclement weather conditions occasionally cause some of our offices to close temporarily or may hamper our project field work in the northern hemisphere's temperate and arctic regions. These occurrences result in fewer billable hours worked on projects and, correspondingly, less revenue recognized.
Potential Liability and Insurance 
Our business activities could expose us to potential liability under various laws and under workplace health and safety regulations. In addition, we occasionally assume liability by contract under indemnification agreements. We cannot predict the magnitude of such potential liabilities.
We maintain a comprehensive general liability insurance policy with an umbrella policy that covers losses beyond the general liability limits. We also maintain professional errors and omissions liability and contractor's pollution liability insurance policies. We believe that both policies provide adequate coverage for our business. When we perform higher-risk work, we obtain, if available, the necessary types of insurance coverage for such activities, as is typically required by our clients.
We obtain insurance coverage through a broker that is experienced in our industry. The broker and our risk manager regularly review the adequacy of our insurance coverage. Because there are various exclusions and retentions under our policies, or an insurance carrier may become insolvent, there can be no assurance that all potential liabilities will be covered by our insurance policies or paid by our carrier.
We evaluate the risk associated with insurance claims. If we determine that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we establish an appropriate reserve. A reserve is not established if we determine that a claim has no merit or is not probable or reasonably estimable. Our historic levels of insurance coverage and reserves have been adequate. However, partially or completely uninsured claims, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Human Capital Management 
Employees. At fiscal 2022 year-end, we had approximately 21,000 staff worldwide. A large percentage of our employees have technical and professional backgrounds and undergraduate and/or advanced degrees, including the employees of recently acquired companies. Our professional staff includes archaeologists, architects, biologists, chemical engineers, chemists, civil engineers, data scientists, computer scientists, economists, electrical engineers, environmental engineers, environmental scientists, geologists, hydrogeologists, mechanical engineers, software engineers, oceanographers, project managers and toxicologists. We consider the current relationships with our employees to be favorable. We are not aware of any employment circumstances that are likely to disrupt work at any of our facilities. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for a discussion of the risks related to the loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel.
Health and Safety. Tetra Tech is committed to providing and maintaining a healthy and safe work environment for our associates. We provide training to all associates to improve their understanding of behaviors that can be perceived as discriminatory, exclusionary and/or harassing, and provide safe avenues for associates to report such behaviors.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Tetra Tech brings together engineers and technical specialists from all backgrounds to solve our clients' most challenging problems. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy guides the Board of Directors, management, associates, subcontractors and partners in developing an inclusive culture. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council monitors Tetra Tech's diversity, equity and inclusion practices and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer for any changes or improvements to our program.
Tetra Tech values diversity, equity and inclusion and undertakes various efforts throughout its operations to promote these initiatives. Our current efforts are focused on these primary areas:
•Equal employment opportunity. Tetra Tech ensures that our practices and processes attract a diverse range of candidates, and those candidates are recruited, hired, assigned, developed and promoted based on merit and their alignment to our values.
•Learning and development opportunities. To support our associates in reaching their full potential, Tetra Tech offers a wide range of internal and external learning and development opportunities. Education assistance is offered to financially support associates who seek to expand their knowledge and skill base.
As part of Tetra Tech's commitment to a culture of inclusion, our Employee Resource Group ("ERG") Program broadens and enhances company-wide interaction opportunities for our employees. Tetra Tech's ERG is open to all associates and involves activities for both employees whose background is the focus of the ERG and those who are supportive of the group (also known as allies). These global networks build on and coordinate with the many local networks that are already active throughout our operations and include groups focused on the experiences of Black, Latino, Pan-Asian, Women, Veterans, Disabled and LGBTQIA+ employees and emerging professionals.
Professional Development. Tetra Tech invests in the professional development of our associates. They are provided with training in leadership development, project management skills and interpersonal skills development. Our focused programs are designed, taught and facilitated by Tetra Tech leadership, consistent with our commitment to talent development. These programs include the following:
