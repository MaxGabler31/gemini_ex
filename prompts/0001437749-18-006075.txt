ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organizational History

On June 22, 2017, The Coretec Group Inc. (the “Group” or the “Company”) filed an Amended Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma to change its name from “3DIcon Corporation” to “The Coretec Group Inc.”, which became effective on June 29, 2017.
The Group, formerly known as 3DIcon Corporation, was incorporated on August 11, 1995, under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. Prior to the September 30, 2016, the day we closed a transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement (as defined below), the Group’s primary activity had been the raising of capital in order to pursue its goal of becoming a significant participant in the development, commercialization and marketing of next generation 3D display technologies.

On September 30, 2016 (the “Closing Date”), we closed a transaction contemplated by a Share Exchange Agreement dated May 31, 2016 (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Coretec, and four Coretec members (the “Members”), which Members held all outstanding membership interests in Coretec. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, Coretec became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, and the Group issued an aggregate 15,870 post-split shares of the Group’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to the Members, resulting in their collective beneficial ownership of approximately 65% of the Group’s common stock on a fully-diluted basis, which shares were subject to a one-year lock up agreement. The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into 1,914 shares, or an aggregate of 30,374,363 post-shares of common stock. Since the parties agreed and acknowledged that such conversion shares were not available for issuance, the Group agreed to take action to proceed in good faith to cause a corporate action that allowed the Group to issue such conversion shares (the “Capitalization Adjustment”). In the event that the Capitalization Adjustment was not completed by May 30, 2017, the Members had an option, but not the obligation, to rescind the Share Exchange Agreement by surrendering for cancellation all consideration paid by the Group and the Group returning all membership interests in Coretec. The Capitalization Adjustment was completed on June 28, 2017 with the completion of a reverse stock split and the Share Exchange Agreement was not rescinded.
Background of the Share Exchange Agreement.
 
As discussed above, on the Closing Date, we closed a transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, pursuant to which Coretec became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. Coretec was organized on June 2, 2015 in the state of North Dakota. It is currently developing, testing, and providing new and/or improved technologies, products, and service solutions for medical, electronic, photonic, display, and lighting markets among others. The combination of the two companies provides a significant number of opportunities to increase shareholder value by:

● | Providing technological support to advance the refinement of CSpace® image material;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adding recognized expertise to the team;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Creating the opportunity for near-term revenue;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | Adding a significant portfolio of Intellectual Property (IP); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Drug delivery 

 Overview of the Consolidated Company.
 
Coretec’s Technology. Coretec’s underlying technology is based on the production of a high value liquid silicon precursor, cyclohexasilane (“CHS”). A key advantage of CHS is that it remains in liquid form at room temperature and does not convert to a gas until heated above 400°F. This compares to materials commonly used for manufacturing silicon-based semiconductors and solar cells (monosilane or trichlorosilane) that have much lower boiling points which leads to higher cost handling and shipping. Another key advantage of CHS is that the production rate of the silicon-forming step can be increased by a factor of six relative to the currently used materials, leading to significant cost savings. We anticipate that CHS will first be used as an alternative to monosilane or trichlorosilane when adding silicon to lithium ion batteries or when used in manufacturing silicon-based semiconductors.
 
We also see longer term potential in several emerging markets where there are opportunities in the conversion of CHS into nanoparticles and nanowires for use in such emerging, high-growth markets as:
 

● | Energy storage
--+---------------


● | Solid state lighting
--+---------------------


● | Authentication of critical documentation
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Printable electronics
--+----------------------


● | Building-integrated solar energy
--+---------------------------------

Coretec’s IP portfolio of silicon-based materials in-licensed rights pursuant to an exclusive, global licensing agreement (the “License”) entered into between Coretec and the NDSU Research Foundation (NDSU/RF) in June 2016. The License provides access to 11 existing and three pending patents representing the global intellectual property around this silicon-based technology for all the markets we have identified.
  
Enhancement of CSpace. A key challenge in the development of CSpace® has been the development of the material to be used for the image chamber. The Company had been exploring a variety of glass alternatives under a Joint Development Agreement with Schott Defense, a global leader in specialty glass materials. While progress continued to be made, it was concluded that limitations remained, primarily in weight and cost.
 
A key virtue of having access to the Coretec IP portfolio of silicon-based materials is that we can now use all of the manufacturing infrastructure and knowledge that is available for optical plastics for the CSpace® image chamber. The benefit to CSpace® is that silicon-based optical plastics can be molded into a broad range of shapes and allow the image chamber to be much lighter and much lower in cost than the glass material we worked with before.
 
Near-Term Revenue Opportunities. Opportunities for near-term revenue continue to be explored in battery and microelectronic markets. Interest in the use of silicon in Li-ion batteries continues to increase driven by the growing demand for electrical vehicles and home energy storage systems for backup power. Discussions are ongoing with suppliers of Li-ion battery anode materials that are seeking next generation materials to further increase performance while improving lifetime, safety and reliability. We believe these suppliers will be well positioned to take advantage of the benefits provided by CHS when combined as a liquid with other powder-based materials. While we believe the use of CHS in Li-ion batteries will provide near term revenue, we also continue to explore revenue opportunities in microelectronics and especially those early adopter markets where advanced microelectronics are being developed in lower volumes and with less price sensitivity. 
 
Recent Developments.

Supply Agreement
 
On December 13, 2016, we entered into a Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with Gelest Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (“Gelest”). This Supply Agreement is for the purchase and sale of CHS as set forth in the Supply Agreement (the “Products”), pursuant to which the Company agrees to use Gelest as a primary source to manufacture the Products for a period of three years. NDSU provided raw materials required to produce CHS to Gelest in January 2017. Efforts by Gelest to scale the manufacturing process for CHS are ongoing with the goal of producing up to 400 grams of material that will be available for sale to potential customers. An initial estimate of pricing for the Products is set forth in the Supply Agreement, which varies from $28/gram to $35/gram based on the quantity and quality of material that is being purchased. We believe this price is competitive with competing higher order silanes such as trisilane and neopentasilane while offering a number of advantages. 
Research North Dakota Grant
 
The North Dakota Center of Excellence Commission awarded a funding request for Research North Dakota (“RND”) grant to NDSU Chemistry and Biochemistry in partnership with the Company. RND promotes the development and commercialization of products and processes through industry/university research partnerships. RND provides matching funds to help companies pay for the university research. The $150,000 matching grant was effective April 1, 2017 and expired on March 31, 2018. We shall provide for a match to State dollars of at least $1:$1. The match can be in the form of contribution directly to NDSU or cash expended by us on valid costs incurred in support of the project. The purpose of the grant is to improve the yield and purity of the key ingredients required for an economical synthesis of CHS, an ingredient for making a variety of commercially important silicon-based materials and materials for lightweight batteries and lightweight solar cells. 
Name Change and Reverse Stock Split
 
On June 22, 2017, the Group filed an Amended Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma, to (i) change its name from “3DIcon Corporation” to “The Coretec Group Inc.” (“Name Change”) and to (ii) effect a 1-for-300 reverse stock split (“Reverse Split”). The Name Change and Reverse Split became effective with the State of Oklahoma on June 28, 2017 and with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) on June 29, 2017 (“Effective Time”).
 
At the Effective Time, each 300 shares of the Group’s common stock, par value $.0002 per share (“Common Stock”), issued and outstanding were converted and reclassified into one share of the Group’s Common Stock. No fractional shares of the Group’s Common Stock were issued in connection with the Reverse Split. Shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share received a new certificate rounding up their fractional share to the next nearest full share.
 
The Common Stock is currently quoted on OTC Pink under “CRTG”.
 
Overview of Business
 
Coretec Business
 
Coretec Industries LLC, a North Dakota limited liability company based in Fargo, was established in 2015 to create technology-based solutions (products and services) that address energy-related market needs globally. Coretec was founded by three corporate entities: EOS Management LLC, Carlton James North Dakota, Ltd., and ChymaTek Energy Solutions, LLC. Principals supporting the business include Simon Calton, and Ronald Dombrowski. The principals have combined expertise in forming and managing technology-based startups, fundraising, sales, and marketing. They are advised by Ramez Elgammal, VP of Technology, an expert in silicon chemistry and Doug Freitag, Chairman of our Advisory Board, an expert in the application of Si materials and Federal business development.
Coretec’s business model is to identify and commercialize disruptive technologies in silicon and 3D visualization serving advanced technology markets in support of global grand challenges in health, environment, security and energy. Sources of disruptive technology are licensed technology created by major universities, institutes, national laboratories and other research centers. Where technology does not already exist, research is to be sponsored and jointly developed with our customers. The initial candidates for commercialization center around CHS, and a source of this technology includes silicon technologies developed by the group of Dr. Philip Boudjouk at NDSU. CHS technologies include methods to produce and process cyclohexasilane (Si6H12), “stacked” polysilane ((R2Si)n) and their alloys with various dopants into liquid silane, Si, silicon nitride, and SiC thin films, Si nanowires and Si QDs. Future technologies will include high refractive index siloxane polymers (HRISP).

Gelest Supply Agreement
 
Pursuant to our Supply Agreement with Gelest we agreed to use Gelest as a primary source to manufacture our CHS Products for a period of three years.  The Supply Agreement provides us the opportunity to scale the manufacturing process for CHS and with the initial goal of producing up to 400 grams of material that will be available for sale to potential customers. An initial estimate of pricing for the Products is set forth in the Supply Agreement, which varies from $28/gram to $35/gram based on the quantity and quality of material that is being purchased. We believe this price for prototype material is competitive with competing higher order silanes such as trisilane and neopentasilane while offering a number of competitive advantages.
Competition
 
Based on our market research and competitive analysis, we have concluded that our CHS technology is unique and provides an advantage in that it should allow 1) production at high yields at low cost using readily available raw materials, 2) storage, transport and use as a liquid at room temperature 3) processing of the liquid into fibers, particles, and films that when heated forms silicon, and 4) the simple addition of dopants to the liquid at an atomic level that when heated forms doped silicon. Competing silanes provided by numerous manufacturers exist as a gas at room temperature and are explosive resulting in greater cost during storage, handling, transportation and use. Our closest competitor is cyclopentasilane which exists as a gas at room temperature and has proven costly and difficult to manufacture. Other competitors exist in specific applications. For example, graphene and carbon nanotubes are potential competitors in printable electronics but are only now emerging and require purification that is proving costly. 
Licenses
 
Coretec’s first priority is providing new or improved silicon-based materials that meet the needs and specifications of: a) battery energy storage (Li-ion batteries), b) solid-state lighting (LEDs), c) solar energy (BIPV) and d) printable electronics (Asset Monitoring) markets. To achieve this priority, Coretec will license certain silicon-based material technologies and IP that are derived from or are based upon new innovations in cyclohexasilane (Si6H12), Si QDs, “stacked” polysilane ((R2Si)n) and unique processes developed for their application. The material technologies and IP were invented by NDSU and are owned by NDSU’s authorized assignee, the NDSU/RF. Coretec has licensed from NDSU/RF a portfolio of silicon-related technologies and IP beginning with four inventions or intellectual property cases (NDSU/RF labels its intellectual property cases as “RFTs”).

Products
 
Coretec, under licenses from NDSU/RF, has commercial rights to certain key inventions created by NDSU that are based, in part or whole, on novel silicon-based materials. These silicon-based materials can be used to make new or improved products and other commercial applications. Coretec will be working with strategic partners to incorporate such novel materials into such new or improved products to the marketplace. Coretec’s business model features revenue coming initially from licenses granted to strategic partners to be followed by future sales of products developed and made by Coretec and/or through joint ventures with other companies. Specifically, Coretec’s license agreement with NDSU/RF currently provides rights to four patents for silicon-based, composition technologies (RFT-0039, 0265, 0324, 0325).
 
These licensed patents and patent applications (and other, related intellectual property including know-how, show-how, and trade secrets) concern various chemical compositions such as silanes (compounds containing a Si-H bond) and other silicon-based materials including, but not limited to, cyclohexasilane (“Si6H12” or “CHS”) and related dianion salt, various “doped” derivatives of Si6H12, and “stacked” polysilanes. These novel materials and processes will be used to produce new or improved energy storage (Li-ion batteries), solid-state lighting (LEDs), solar energy (BIPV), printable electronics (Asset Monitoring) and other commercially important products and applications.
 

Company Business
 
The Company is developing a patented volumetric 3D display technology that was developed by and with the University of Oklahoma (the “University”) under an SRA. The development to date has resulted in multiple new technologies, two working laboratory prototypes (Lab Proto 1 and Lab Proto 2), and eight provisional patents; five of the eight provisional patents have been combined and converted to five utility patents. Under the SRA, the Company has obtained the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to these 3D display technologies.
 
On May 26, 2009, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") approved the patent called "Volumetric Liquid Crystal Display" for rendering a three-dimensional image and converted it to U.S. patent No. 7,537,345. On December 28, 2010, USPTO approved the patent called “Light Surface Display for Rendering a Three-Dimensional Image,” and issued the United States Patent No. 7,858,913. On August 21, 2012, the USPTO approved a continuation patent called “3D Volumetric Display” and issued the US Patent No. 8,247,755. These patents describe the foundation of what is called CSpace® technology (“CSpace”).
 
Company Overview
 
The Company intends to commercialize the CSpace volumetric 3D technology through a combination of government funded research and development contracts, joint development agreements with industry partners and technology licensing agreements for high value applications in military planning, cyber data analysis, battlespace visualization, oil and gas exploration and medical imaging.
 
 9



Commercialization Strategy and Target Applications
 
The Company plans to commercialize the CSpace volumetric 3D technology through customer funded research and development contracts and technology licensing agreements for high value applications like air traffic control, design visualization, and medical imaging. The Company plans to develop products for contract engineering and with joint development customers. At this time the Company does not have any commercialized products and does not plan to develop its own products based on the CSpace technology due to the high value / low volume nature of the best-fit initial applications for this technology. These applications include but are not limited to the following:

● | Healthcare (diagnostics, surgical planning, training, telemedicine, biosurveillance);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cyber security data visualization;
--+-----------------------------------


● | Military (operational planning, training, modeling and simulation, battlespace awareness, damage assessment, autonomous piloting);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Physical security (passenger, luggage & cargo screening);
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Mining, oil & gas exploration; or
--+----------------------------------


● | Meteorological and oceanographic data visualization.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
Based on our market research and competitive analysis to date, we have concluded that the CSpace volumetric technology is unique and advantaged versus other 3D technologies in that it can deliver both 1) a true 360 degree viewing experience for multiple simultaneous users, and 2) high image quality, high reliability and large image size. Rear projection 3D displays such as those from Zecotek, Setred, and EuroLCDs (formerly LC Tech LightSpace) do not provide a 360-degree viewing experience and are typically limited to one or two users. Early proof of concept work done on infrared active phosphor displays by 3D Display Laboratories proved to not be scalable due to limited phosphor persistence and vector scanning limitations. While holographic and light field displays show promise, they do not deliver a true 360-degree viewing experience and cost effective multiple user systems do not appear feasible due to current and expected pixel density, data bandwidth and compute power limitations.
 
History of 3D Technology Research and Development at the University of Oklahoma
 
Beginning in 2007 the University, under an SRA with the Company, undertook the development of high potential 3D display technologies.
 
It is anticipated that Coretec’s technology will play a key role in the continued development of an image space material for CSpace.
 
Intellectual Property History, Status and Rights
 
The USPTO approved the pending patent called "Volumetric Liquid Crystal Display" for rendering a three-dimensional image and converted it to US patent No. 7,537,345. On July 16, 2013, USPTO approved the pending patent called “Computer System with Digital Micromirror Device,” and issued US patent No. 8,487,865.
 
CSpace Patents are as follow: On December 28, 2010, USPTO approved the pending patent called “Light Surface Display for Rendering a Three-Dimensional Image,” and issued the US Patent No. 7,858,913. On August 21, 2012, the USPTO approved a continuation patent called “3D Volumetric Display” and issued the US Patent No. 8,247,755. On December 13, 2011, USPTO approved a continuation patent called “3D Light Surface Display,” and issued the US Patent No. 8,075,139.
 
Through a SRA with the University, we have obtained the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to certain 3D display technologies under development by the University. The development to date has resulted in the University filing eight provisional patents; five of the eight provisional patents have been combined and converted to five utility US patents, one pending European patent and one pending Japanese patent.
 
In addition, the Company owns exclusively two U.S. patents as noted below.
