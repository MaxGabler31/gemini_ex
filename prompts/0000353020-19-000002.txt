Overview
Aegion combines innovative technologies with market leading expertise to maintain, rehabilitate and strengthen pipelines and other infrastructure around the world. Since 1971, we have played a pioneering role in finding transformational solutions to rehabilitate aging infrastructure, primarily pipelines in the wastewater, water, energy, mining and refining industries. We also maintain the efficient operation of refineries and other industrial facilities and provide innovative solutions for the strengthening and increased longevity of buildings, bridges and other structures. We are committed to Stronger. Safer. Infrastructure®. We believe the depth and breadth of our products and services make us a leading provider for the world’s infrastructure rehabilitation and protection needs.
Our Company premise is to use technology to extend the structural design life and maintain, if not improve, the performance of infrastructure, mostly pipelines and piping systems. We have proved this expertise can be applied in a variety of markets to protect pipelines in oil, gas, nuclear, power, utility, mining, wastewater and water applications and can be extended to the rehabilitation and maintenance of commercial structures and the provision of professional services in energy-related industries. Many types of infrastructure must be protected from the corrosive and abrasive materials that pass through or near them. Our expertise in non-disruptive corrosion engineering and abrasion protection is wide-ranging. We have a long history of product development and intellectual property management. We manufacture many of the engineered solutions we offer to customers as well as the specialized equipment required to install them. Finally, decades of experience give us an advantage in understanding municipal, utility, energy, mining, industrial and commercial customers. Strong customer relationships and brand recognition allow us to support the expansion of existing and innovative technologies in our core end markets.
We originally incorporated in Delaware in 1980 to act as the exclusive United States licensee of the Insituform® cured-in-place pipe (“CIPP”) process, which Insituform’s founder invented in 1971. The Insituform® CIPP process served as the first trenchless technology for rehabilitating wastewater pipelines and has enabled municipalities and private industry to avoid the extraordinary expense and extreme disruption that can result from conventional “dig-and-replace” methods. We have maintained our leadership position in the CIPP market from manufacturing to technological innovations and market share for over 45 years.
We embarked on a diversification strategy in 2009 to expand not only our geographic reach but also our product and service portfolio into the oil and gas markets. Through a series of strategic initiatives and key acquisitions, we now possess a broad portfolio of cost-effective solutions for rehabilitating and maintaining aging or deteriorating infrastructure, protecting new infrastructure from corrosion and other threats, and providing integrated professional services in engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and turnaround services for oil and natural gas companies, primarily in the midstream and 
2

downstream markets. Today, our long-term strategy is to invest in our core end markets for organic growth and acquire innovative technologies to enhance our competitive position.
Our Segments
We have three operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: Infrastructure Solutions, Corrosion Protection and Energy Services. Our operating segments correspond to our management organizational structure. Each operating segment has leadership that reports to our chief executive officer, who is also the chief operating decision manager (“CODM”). The operating results and financial information reported by each of the segments are evaluated separately, reviewed regularly and used by the CODM to evaluate segment performance, allocate resources and determine management incentive compensation. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report for further discussion regarding our segments.
Infrastructure Solutions – The majority of our work is performed in the municipal water and wastewater pipeline sector and, while the pace of growth is primarily driven by government funding and spending, overall demand due to required infrastructure improvements in our core markets should result in a long-term stable growth opportunity for our market leading products, Insituform® CIPP, the Tyfo® system and Fusible PVC® pipe.
Corrosion Protection – Corrosion Protection is positioned to capture the benefits of continued oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure developments across North America and internationally, as producers and midstream pipeline companies transport their product from onshore and offshore oil and gas fields to regional demand centers. The segment has a broad portfolio of technologies, products and services to protect, maintain, rehabilitate, assess and monitor pipelines from the effects of corrosion, including cathodic protection, interior pipe linings, interior and exterior pipe coatings and inspection and repair capabilities, as well as an increasing offering of data management capabilities related to these services. We provide solutions to customers to enhance the safety, environmental integrity, reliability and compliance of their pipelines in the global transmission and distribution network, especially in the oil and gas markets.
Energy Services – We offer a unique value proposition based on our world-class safety and labor productivity programs, which allow us to provide cost-effective construction, maintenance, turnaround and specialty services at customers’ refineries as well as chemical and other industrial facilities. We understand the demands and the level of critical planning required to ensure a successful turnaround or shutdown and offer a full range of services as part of our facility maintenance solutions, while maintaining a reputation for being safe, professional and providing predictable value.
Our Long-Term Strategy
We are committed to being a valued partner to our customers, with a constant focus on expanding those relationships by solving complex infrastructure problems, enhancing our capabilities and improving execution while also developing or acquiring innovative technologies and comprehensive services. We are pursuing three key strategic initiatives:
Municipal Pipeline Rehabilitation – The fundamental driver in the global municipal pipeline rehabilitation market is the growing gap between the need and current spend. While we do not expect the spending gap to close any time soon, the increasing need for pipeline rehabilitation supports a long-term sustainable market for the technologies and services offered by our Infrastructure Solutions segment. We are committed to maintaining our market leadership position in the rehabilitation of wastewater pipelines in North America using our CIPP technology, the largest contributor to Aegion’s consolidated revenues. We have a diverse portfolio of trenchless technologies to rehabilitate aging and damaged municipal pipelines. The focus today is growing our presence in the rehabilitation of pressure pipelines through both internal development and acquisitions. Our pressure pipe portfolio includes Fusible PVC®, InsituMain® CIPP, Tyfo® fiber-reinforce polymer (“FRP”) and Tite Liner® high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”) systems. Our international strategy is to use a blend of third-party product sales as well as CIPP and FRP contract installation operations in select markets. A key to the success of this strategy is a continuing focus on improving productivity to reduce costs and increase efficiencies across the entire value chain from engineering, manufacturing and installation of our technology-based solutions.
Pipeline Integrity and Corrosion Management – There are over one million miles of regulated pipelines in North America, which remain the safest and most cost-effective mode of oil and gas transmission. Within our Corrosion Protection segment, the design and installation of cathodic protection systems to help prevent pipeline corrosion have historically represented a large portion of the revenues and profits for the segment. We also provide inspection services to monitor these systems and detect early signs of corrosion. In 2017, we launched a new asset integrity management program designed to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the pipeline corrosion assessment data we collect as well as upgrade how we share this valuable information with customers. Through this program, we 
3

seek to improve customer regulatory compliance and add new services in the areas of data gathering and validation, advanced analytics and predictive maintenance.
Downstream Oil Refining and Industrial Facility Maintenance – We have long-term relationships with oil refinery and industrial customers on the United States West Coast through our Energy Services segment. Our objective is to leverage those relationships to expand the services we provide in mechanical maintenance, electrical and instrumentation services, small capital construction, shutdown and turnaround maintenance activity and specialty services. We also continue to promote our safety and scaffolding services. There are opportunities in other industries on the West Coast such as oil and oil product terminals, chemicals, industrial gas and power to leverage our experience in maintenance and construction services. In addition, we are looking to expand our turnaround and specialty services beyond the West Coast.

Technologies
Infrastructure Solutions
Our Insituform® CIPP process (including Insitupipe® and Insitutube®) for the rehabilitation of wastewater pipelines and other conduits utilizes a custom-manufactured tube, or liner, made of synthetic fiber. After the tube is saturated (impregnated) with a thermosetting resin mixture, it is installed in the host pipe by various processes. The resin is then cured, by heat (hot water or steam) or ultraviolet light, forming a new rigid pipe within a pipe.
Our iPlus® Infusion® pull-in CIPP is a trenchless method for the rehabilitation of small-diameter wastewater pipelines, whereby a felt liner is continuously impregnated with liquid, thermosetting resin through a proprietary process, after which the liner is pulled into the host pipe, inflated with air and cured with steam or ultraviolet light.
Our iPlus® Composite CIPP is used for the trenchless rehabilitation of large-diameter wastewater pipelines, where the felt liner is reinforced with carbon or glass fiber, impregnated with liquid, thermosetting resin, inverted into place and cured with hot water or steam.
Our InsituMain® CIPP system is a solution for pressure pipes, including water mains and force mains up to 96-inches in diameter. The system can negotiate bends and is pressure-rated up to 150 psi. The InsituMain® system has also been certified as complying with NSF/ANSI Standard 61.
Our Insituform® RPP™ process is a trenchless technology used for the rehabilitation of wastewater force mains and industrial pressure pipelines. The felt tube is reinforced with glass and impregnated with liquid, thermosetting resin, after which it is inverted with water and cured with hot water to form a structural, jointless pipe within the host pipe.
Our Insituform® PPL® process is a trenchless technology certified to NSF/ANSI Standard 61 used for the rehabilitation of drinking water and industrial pressure pipelines. A glass-reinforced liner is impregnated with an epoxy or vinyl ester resin, inverted with water and cured with hot water to form a jointless pipe lining within the host pipe.
6

Our iPlus® Glass UV system is a CIPP solution for small- to medium-diameter pipes utilizing a glass fiber tube that is impregnated with a resin sensitive to ultraviolet light. The tube is pulled into place in the host pipe, inflated by air and cured via an ultraviolet light source. 
Sliplining is a method used to push or pull a new pipeline into an old one. With segmented sliplining, short segments of pipe are joined to form the new pipe. For gravity wastewater rehabilitation, these short segments can often be joined in a manhole or access structure, eliminating the need for a large pulling pit.
Our iTap® is an internal service line reinstatement process that includes associated fittings, robotics and control systems for leak free connections in CIPP lined potable water mains.
Our Fusible PVC® technology contains proprietary polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) formulation that, when combined with its patented fusion process, results in a monolithic, fully-restrained, gasket-free, leak-free piping system. Fusible PVC® pipe products include Fusible C-900® and FPVC® pipes. Fusible C-900® pipes comply with the AWWA C900 standard and are certified to the NSF/ANSI Standard 61.
Our Tyfo® system applies high-strength fiber fabric to strengthen structures, including pipelines, and the connections between structural components, thereby strengthening, repairing and restoring masonry, concrete, steel and wooden structures. Beyond general strengthening of pipelines and structures, the Tyfo® system also has application in blast mitigation and seismic reinforcement.
See “Patents and Proprietary Technologies” below for more information concerning certain of these technologies.
Corrosion Protection
Our Tite Liner® system is a method of lining new and existing pipe with a corrosion and abrasion resistant thermoplastic pipe.
Our Safetyliner™ product is a grooved thermoplastic liner that is installed in an industrial pipeline using the Tite Liner® process. The Safetyliner™ liner is normally used in natural gas or CO2 pipelines to allow the release of gas that permeates the thermoplastic liner. If gas is allowed to build in the annular space under normal operating conditions, the line can be susceptible to collapse upon sudden changes in operating pressures. The Safetyliner™ liner also has been used in pipelines as a leak detection system and for dual containment in mine water pipelines.
The fusion bonded epoxy application process utilizes heat to melt a dry powder FBE coating material into liquid form. The liquid material flows onto the steel pipe and solidifies through a process called cross-linking. Once cooled, this “fusion-bonded” epoxy cannot return to its original state and forms a corrosion protection barrier on the interior or exterior surface of the pipe.
Our 3-layer polyethylene coating is an external coating for buried or submerged oil or gas pipelines and offers superior adhesion, cathodic disbondment resistance and mechanical protection.
Our deepwater coating and insulation capabilities answer the challenge of subsea wet insulation requirements for high-pressure and high-temperature environments. Applications include subsea equipment and field joints for coating the girth welds where the pipe coating has been cutback to allow for welding joints of pipe.
Our internal field joint coating technology consists of self-contained robots that travel inside the pipe, find the weld and then blast clean, vacuum and coat the area. Utilizing various cameras, these field joint coating robots transmit a real-time video image back to the operator which is then used for control and inspection. The technology allows for the field application of FBE and plural component liquid materials to the weld area.
Cathodic protection is an electrochemical process that prevents corrosion of new structures and stops corrosion on existing structures. Metal loss is prevented by the passing of a very small direct current from a cathodic protection electrode (anode), through the electrolyte (soil, water, concrete, etc.) on to the structure to be protected (cathode). In this process, the anode corrodes, sacrificing itself to protect the integrity of the cathode. Structures commonly protected by this process include oil and gas pipelines, offshore platforms, above and underground storage tanks, ships, electric power plants, bridges, parking garages, transit systems and water and wastewater facilities.
Our CorrFlex® system is a linear anode system installed parallel to pipelines, oftentimes to prevent stress corrosion cracking that can lead to ruptures on high pressure gas transmission pipelines.
Our CorrSpray® product provides a unique solution for preventing corrosion of steel reinforcements in concrete structures.
Our Corrporwer® DC power supplies include innovative designs, plus remote monitoring and control capabilities.
Our Green Rectifier® system is an ecologically friendly method of cathodic protection using solar panels and a wind generator to power the cathodic protection process.
7

Our Grid™ system has set the global standard for preventing releases from external corrosion of at-grade storage tanks containing oil and petroleum products, thereby ensuring safe operations and protection of the environment.
Our AC interference mitigation solution protects pipeline operators and the public from electrical hazards when pipelines share space on rights-of-way with overhead electric transmission lines. Beginning with advanced predictive modeling, we then design mitigation schemes and provide systems to protect people and the pipeline.
Our asset integrity management platform allows for the collection, communication and storage of data in a geospatial information system-based, centralized, integrated repository that provides us and our customers more timely information and improved data analytics. Data collection applications include LiveLine™ and CIS View™, data delivery applications include AssetView™ and FieldLine®, and data analytical tools include ScanLine™, ChargeLine® and BaseLine™.
See “Patents and Proprietary Technologies” below for more information concerning certain of these technologies.
Energy Services
Our DelayTrak® system identifies delays in real time. The data is used to identify and quickly communicate improvement opportunities and, later, action plans for improvement.
Our TimeTrak™ system tracks how time is spent by crews on a jobsite. The data is used to drive process improvements in routine maintenance.
Operations
We are organized into three operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: Infrastructure Solutions, Corrosion Protection and Energy Services. Each segment is regularly reviewed and evaluated separately.
Our operations are generally project oriented. Projects may range in duration from just a few days to several years and can be performed as one-time contracts or as part of longer-term agreements. These contracts are usually obtained through competitive bidding or negotiations and require performance at a fixed price or time and materials basis. Our Corrosion Protection and Energy Services projects are generally performed under contracts with industrial entities. A majority of our water and wastewater rehabilitation installation projects in our Infrastructure Solutions segment are performed under contracts with municipal entities. Independent contractors may be utilized to perform portions of the work on any given project that we provide.
Infrastructure Solutions Operations
Our water and wastewater pipeline rehabilitation activities are conducted principally through installation and other construction operations performed directly by our subsidiaries.
Our North American Infrastructure Solutions operations, including research and development, engineering, training and financial support systems, are headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. Tube manufacturing and processing facilities for North America are maintained in ten locations, geographically dispersed throughout the United States and Canada to support our North American contracting operations and through which we sell liners to third parties, domestically and internationally.
We also conduct Insituform® CIPP process rehabilitation operations worldwide through our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We utilize multifunctional robotic devices developed by a wholly-owned French subsidiary in connection with the inspection and repair of pipelines. We also maintain a manufacturing facility in Wellingborough, United Kingdom and three processing facilities in Europe to support our international operations and through which we sell liners to third parties internationally.
We have granted licenses to our trenchless rehabilitation processes to unaffiliated companies in certain geographic regions. As described under “Ownership Interests in Operating Licensees and Joint Ventures” below, we have also entered into contractual joint ventures from time to time to capitalize on our trenchless rehabilitation processes. Under these contractual joint venture relationships, work is bid by the joint venture entity and subcontracted to the joint venture partners or to third parties. The joint venture partners are primarily responsible for their subcontracted work, but both joint venture partners are liable to the customer for all of the work. Revenues and associated costs are recorded using percentage-of-completion accounting for our subcontracted portion of the total contract only.
In addition to wastewater pipeline rehabilitation, we have performed water pipeline rehabilitation operations since 2006 using our pressure pipe product portfolio. We are now able to restore water pipes using our InsituMain® CIPP and the Tite Liner® and Tyfo® systems.
Our acquisition in February 2016 of Underground Solutions, headquartered in Poway, California, bolstered our capabilities with respect to water pipeline rehabilitation operations. We are now able to provide additional infrastructure technologies for water, wastewater and conduit applications, primarily Fusible PVC® pipe, which, when combined with its patented fusion process, results in a monolithic, fully-restrained, gasket-free, leak-free piping system.
8

Our infrastructure rehabilitation operations also utilize FRP to rehabilitate and strengthen pipelines throughout the United States through Fibrwrap Construction Services, headquartered in San Diego, California. We also design and manufacture FRP composite systems used for rehabilitating buildings, bridges, tunnels, industrial developments and waterfront structures, which we supply to certified applicators. We service the European FRP markets with respect to product and engineering services through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. We service the Asia-Pacific FRP market, with respect to both product and engineering services as well as application services, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and New Zealand and through our joint ventures in Borneo and Indonesia.

We have previously entered into teaming and other cooperative arrangements in various geographic regions throughout the world in order to develop cooperative bids on contracts for our thermoplastic pipeline rehabilitation and cathodic protection businesses. Typically, the arrangements provide for each participant to complete its respective scope of work, and we are not required to complete the other participant’s scope of work. We continue to investigate opportunities for expanding our business through such arrangements.
We previously entered into contractual joint ventures in other geographic regions in order to develop joint bids on contracts for our wastewater pipeline rehabilitation business. Typically, the joint venture entity holds the contract with the owner and subcontracts portions of the work to the joint venture partners. As part of the subcontracts, the partners usually provide bonds to the joint venture. We could be required to complete our joint venture partner’s portion of the contract if the partner were unable to complete its portion and a bond is not available. We continue to investigate opportunities for expanding our business through such arrangements.
Product Development
We seek out and develop innovative solutions for pipelines and other infrastructure through a stage-gate process for management of our research and development initiatives. The process is executed under the direction of our Chief Technical Officer with a market and business impact evaluation at each gate review. Corporate and business unit resources make up the specific research and development teams, supplemented, where beneficial, by our technology partners (often major suppliers), outside consultants and academic institutions. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we spent $5.6 million, $4.2 million and $4.7 million, respectively, on research and development related activities, including engineering.
Customers and Marketing
We offer our products and services to highly diverse markets worldwide. We service municipal, state and federal governments, as well as corporate customers in numerous industries including pipelines, energy, oil and gas, refinery, mining, general and industrial construction, infrastructure (buildings, bridges, tunnels, railways, etc.), water and wastewater, 
10

transportation, utilities, maritime and defense. Our products and services are currently utilized and performed in over 80 countries across six continents.
We offer our corrosion protection solutions worldwide to energy, refinery, mining and other customers to protect new and existing pipelines and other structures. The marketing of wastewater pipeline rehabilitation technologies is focused primarily on the municipal wastewater markets worldwide. We offer our water rehabilitation products to municipal and commercial customers. We offer our other infrastructure rehabilitation products worldwide to certain certified third-party installers and applicators and market our engineering, manufacturing and, in some countries, installation services to municipal, state, federal and commercial customers. We offer our Energy Services solutions primarily to the oil and gas markets on the West Coast, but have been actively pursuing opportunities beyond the West Coast. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had one customer that accounted for approximately 12.1% of our consolidated revenues primarily due to a large deepwater pipe coating and insulation project that was substantially completed during the year.
To help shape decision-making at every step, we use a highly-trained, multi-level sales force structured around target markets and key accounts, focusing on engineers, contractors, consultants, administrators, technical staff and public officials. Due to the technical nature of our products and services, many of our sales personnel have engineering or technical expertise and experience. We also produce sales literature and presentations, participate in trade shows, present at conferences and execute other marketing programs for our own sales force and those of unaffiliated licensees. Our unaffiliated licensees are responsible for marketing and sales activities in their respective territories. See “Licensees” and “Ownership Interests in Operating Licensees and Joint Ventures” above for a description of our licensing operations and for a description of investments in licensees.
Contract Backlog
Contract backlog is our expectation of revenues to be generated from received, signed and uncompleted contracts, the cancellation of which is not anticipated at the time of reporting. We assume that these signed contracts are funded. For government or municipal contracts, our customers generally obtain funding through local budgets or pre-approved bond financing. We generally do not undertake a process to verify funding status of these contracts and, therefore, cannot reasonably estimate what portion, if any, of our contracts in backlog have not been funded. However, we have little history of signed contracts being canceled due to the lack of funding. Contract backlog excludes any term contract amounts for which there are not specific and determinable work releases and projects where we have been advised that we are the low bidder, but have not formally been awarded the contract.
In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination or suspension at the discretion of the customer. Contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in scope and of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. Accordingly, backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings.
Included within backlog for Energy Services are amounts that represent expected revenues to be realized under long-term Master Service Agreements (“MSAs”) and other signed contracts. If the remaining term of these arrangements exceeds 12 months, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such arrangements included in backlog are limited to only the next 12 months of expected revenues. Although backlog represents only those contracts and MSAs that are considered to be firm, there can be no assurance that cancellation or scope adjustments will not occur with respect to such contracts.
Included within backlog for Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection are certain contracts that are performed through our variable interest entities in which we own a controlling portion of the entity. With the exception of Energy Services, a substantial majority of our contracts in these two segments are fixed price contracts with individual private businesses and municipal and federal government entities across the world. Energy Services generally enters into cost reimbursable contracts that are based on costs incurred at agreed upon contractual rates.
For additional information regarding our backlog including those risk factors specific to backlog, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 below.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We maintain our North American Insituform® CIPP process liner manufacturing facility in Batesville, Mississippi. In Europe, we manufacture and sell Insituform® CIPP process liners from our plant located in Wellingborough, United Kingdom. Although raw materials used in Insituform® CIPP process products are typically available from multiple sources, our historical practice has been to purchase materials from a limited number of suppliers. We maintain our own felt manufacturing facility in Batesville, Mississippi. Substantially all of our fiber requirements are purchased from two sources, but there are alternate vendors readily available. We source our global resin supply from multiple vendors. We also manufacture certain equipment 
11

used in our Insituform® CIPP business. We believe that the sources of supply for our Insituform® CIPP operations in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific are adequate for our needs.
We sell Insituform® CIPP process liners and related products to third parties and certain licensees on a long-term or, in certain instances, on a project-by-project basis. In Europe, in addition to sales made on a project-by-project basis, we have entered into supply agreements with three third parties to supply them with Insituform® CIPP process liners and related products.
With regard to Underground Solutions, we have three qualified third-party extruders to manufacture our Fusible PVC® pipe products.
The principal raw materials used by Fyfe Co. in the manufacture of FRP composite materials are carbon, glass, resins, fabric and epoxy raw materials. Fabric and epoxies are the most significant materials purchased, which are currently purchased through a select group of suppliers, although these and the other materials are available from a number of vendors. The weaving of FRP components into woven fabric is done at our facility in La Conner, Washington. Fyfe Co. does specialized blending of unique epoxies from basic chemicals at our Batesville, Mississippi facility. The epoxy resin is also repackaged at our Batesville, Mississippi facility, and specialized blending is also often done on each job site. Fyfe Co. also sells finished materials throughout the United States and worldwide to our affiliates and certain certified third-party applicators.
Product and material revenues for our Corrpro business are derived principally from the sale of products that are purchased from select outside vendors or from assembling components that are sourced from suppliers. We conduct light assembly for a number of our Corrpro products in our production facilities in Sand Springs, Oklahoma; Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; and the United Kingdom. In addition, we manufacture our own line of rectifiers and other power supplies in Canada and the United Kingdom. The primary products and raw materials used by our Corrpro businesses include zinc, aluminum, magnesium and other metallic anodes, as well as wire and cable. We maintain relationships with multiple vendors for these products and are not dependent on any single vendor to meet our supply needs.
The product and service revenues for our United Pipeline Systems business are derived primarily from the procurement and installation of HDPE liners inside pipelines. The raw material used for these liners is extruded thermoplastic pipe. It has been our practice to purchase this material from a select group of suppliers; however, we believe that it is available from many other sources. We manufacture most of the proprietary equipment and many of the consumable items used in Tite Liner® system installations in our own facilities in Canada, the United States and Chile.
Product and service revenues for our ACS business is derived principally from internal and external pipeline coating. Facilities are located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Conroe, Texas and Saudi Arabia. The primary raw materials used in the coating process include FBE and paint. Although our historical practice has been to purchase materials from a limited number of suppliers, we believe that the raw materials used in the coating process are typically available from multiple sources. However, in certain limited circumstances, our customer has required use of a specific material available from only a single source.
Our pricing of raw materials is subject to fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices. See “Commodity Risk” in Item 7A of this Report for detail on our management of the risks associated with such price fluctuations.
Patents and Proprietary Technologies
As of December 31, 2018, we held 32 United States patents relating to the Insituform® CIPP process. As of December 31, 2018, we had seven pending United States patent applications relating to the Insituform® CIPP process.
We have obtained and are pursuing patent protection in our principal foreign markets covering various aspects of the Insituform® CIPP process. As of December 31, 2018, there were 87 issued foreign patents relating to the Insituform® CIPP processes, and 15 applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. Of the applications pending in foreign jurisdictions, one is a Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) application that covers most jurisdictions throughout the world and one is a European Patent Convention (“EPC”) application that covers multiple jurisdictions in Europe. 
As of December 31, 2018, we held 15 United States patents and 13 foreign patents with regard to Fusible PVC® pipe products and fusion processes as well as other infrastructure technologies for water, wastewater and conduit applications that relate to our Fusible PVC® pipe lining business.
As of December 31, 2018, we held 16 issued patents and two pending patent applications in the United States and eight issued patents and five pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions that relate to our Tyfo® system. Of these applications, one is an EPC application that covers multiple jurisdictions in Europe.
For our coating operations, as of December 31, 2018, we held seven issued patents and four pending patent applications in the United States and 10 issued patents and six pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. Of the foreign applications, one is a PCT application that covers most jurisdictions throughout the world.
12

As of December 31, 2018, we had five issued patents and one pending patent application in the United States, and nine issued patents and six pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions that relate to the Tite Liner® process. Of the foreign applications, one is an EPC application that covers multiple jurisdictions in Europe.
For our cathodic protection operations, as of December 31, 2018, we have three pending patent applications in the United States and two pending applications in foreign jurisdictions. Of the foreign applications, one is a PCT application that covers most jurisdictions throughout the world.
The specifications and/or rights granted in relation to each patent will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, as a result of differences in the nature of the work performed and in the climate of the countries in which the work is carried out, we do not necessarily seek patent protection for all of our inventions in every jurisdiction in which we do business.
There can be no assurance that the validity of our patents will not be successfully challenged. Our business could be adversely affected by increased competition upon expiration of the patents or if one or more of our patents were adjudicated to be invalid or inadequate in scope to protect our operations. We believe in either case that our long experience with the proprietary processes, the strength of our trademarks and our degree of market penetration should enable us to continue to compete effectively in the pipeline rehabilitation, corrosion protection, energy, mining and infrastructure protection markets.
In some instances throughout each of our three platforms, we have elected to maintain certain internally developed technologies, know-how and inventions as trade secrets. We have entered into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and third parties to whom we disclose such trade secrets. Although there can be no assurance that these measures will suffice to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use or that third parties will not develop similar technologies, we believe it would take substantial time and resources to independently develop such technologies.
See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Report for further discussion.
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, primarily on the basis of price, quality of service and capacity to perform. Many of our products and services face direct competition from competitors offering similar or essentially equivalent products or services. In addition, customers can select a variety of methods to meet their infrastructure installation, strengthening and rehabilitation needs, as well as their coating and cathodic protection needs, including a number of methods that we do not offer.
In the trenchless wastewater rehabilitation market, the CIPP process is one of the preferred rehabilitation methods. Because relatively few significant barriers to entry exist in this market, any organization with adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. As such, there are numerous companies with which we compete. Worldwide, we compete with numerous smaller firms on local or regional levels and with several larger firms on the global and national levels. Despite the number of competitors, Insituform®, as the worldwide pioneer of this technology, has maintained its role as a global market leader, both in the United States and abroad.
In water rehabilitation, dig-and-replace is still the preferred method for the majority of customers. Currently, we believe CIPP is utilized in less than 5% of water pipeline rehabilitation projects in the United States. Because this is a more specialized field, with more barriers to entry, including strict government mandates, we compete primarily with a handful of global and national specialty contractors.
Our Fusible PVC® products compete against other more-traditional products in the pressure pipe market, such as HDPE and other restrained joint PVC pipe products.
In our infrastructure rehabilitation business, the FRP process competes against traditional methods of pipeline and structural retrofitting, but is gaining acceptance in the construction and retrofitting industries. With its proprietary technologies relating to both products and application, Fyfe Co. is a leader in the FRP market and Fibrwrap Construction, having successfully performed installations of FRP systems for 25 years, is one of the most experienced applicators of the Tyfo® system and has a well-established reputation. In this field, there are barriers to entry, including testing requirements, experience, intellectual property and certifications. Fyfe has teamed with a number of universities around the world to conduct extensive product testing. In addition, Fyfe has dedicated significant resources to obtaining technical market acceptance of its proprietary products. As a result, Fyfe has received a number of certifications, including NSF certification for its Tyfo® system; International Code Council - Evaluation Service Report (ESR-2103), indicating product approval by the International Building Code; and compliance with ICC-AC125 guidelines for FRP strengthening. Because of the barriers to entry, Fyfe Co. and Fibrwrap Construction tend to compete with a small number of companies on a regional or national level, most of which do not provide the full spectrum of services provided by Fyfe Co. and Fibrwrap Construction.
In our Corrosion Protection segment, Corrpro operates in the highly-competitive field of cathodic protection for corrosion control. While this market is highly competitive, because there are relatively few barriers to entry, Corrpro is a recognized market leader in North America in this field. Competitors include a limited number of large firms, which provide services 
13

nationally and, in some instances, globally, although more prevalent are a number of small- and medium-sized firms with more limited portfolios of products and services, which are only provided on a regional or local level. Corrpro’s competitive advantage is its broad depth of high-quality cathodic protection offerings, including its cost-effective engineering, pipeline integrity, construction and coating services, which are provided to customers worldwide. 
The process of utilizing thermoplastic liners is a prevalent method used to protect pipelines servicing the energy and mining industries. United Pipeline Systems is recognized as a leader in the thermoplastic market, having provided relining solutions on six continents. Due to barriers to entry arising from necessary technological capabilities, United Pipeline Systems mainly competes with a small number of specialty firms globally, nationally and regionally. Through our focused efforts on expanding our services worldwide, United Pipeline Systems enjoys significant name recognition and substantial market share in this industry in the key energy and mining regions of the world.
ACS has a strong presence in the field of FBE coating and is an industry leader in both inner diameter robotic coatings and outer diameter coatings. Because of these specialized fields, ACS usually competes with a small number of specialty providers.
Aegion Energy Services operates in a fragmented and intensely competitive field of plant maintenance and construction and specialty services in the downstream oil refining industry, as well as performing work in the industrial and natural gas, gas processing and compression markets. Competitors may be local, regional or national contractors and service providers and vary with the markets that are served, with few competitors competing in all of the geographic markets we serve or offering all of the services we provide. With the implementation of the California Refinery Safety Law, competition at refineries in California is from building trade union contractors or, in some instances, from customers themselves expanding their own workforces to reduce reliance on contractors. Contracts are generally awarded based on safety performance, reputation for quality, price, schedule and client satisfaction. However, with the new California Refinery Safety Law in place, the trade unions have increasing influence in the California labor market and on union contractors. Issues around labor relations and access to supplemental labor are new factors affecting client decisions in selecting contractors. 
There can be no assurance as to the success of our processes in competition with our competitors and alternative technologies for pipe installation and rehabilitation, coating, cathodic protection and infrastructure installation, strengthening and rehabilitation.
Seasonality
Our operations can be affected by seasonal variations and our results tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of each year due to typically milder weather in the regions in which we operate. We are more likely to be impacted by weather extremes, such as excessive rain, hurricanes or monsoons, snow and ice or frigid temperatures, which may cause temporary, short-term anomalies in our operational performance in certain localized geographic regions. However, these impacts usually have not been material to our operations as a whole. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Report for further discussion.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 5,350 employees. Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements that covered an aggregate of approximately 1,500 employees as of December 31, 2018. We generally consider our relations with our employees and unions to be good.
Insurance and Bonding
We are required to carry insurance and provide bonding in connection with certain projects and, accordingly, maintain comprehensive insurance policies, including workers’ compensation, general and automobile liability and property coverage. We believe that we presently maintain adequate insurance coverage for all operations. We have also arranged bonding capacity for bid, performance and payment bonds. Typically, the cost of a performance bond is less than 1% of the contract value. We are required to indemnify the surety companies against losses from third-party claims of customers and subcontractors. The indemnification obligations are collateralized by unperfected liens on our assets and the assets of those subsidiaries that are parties to the applicable indemnification agreement.
Government Regulation
We are required to comply with all applicable United States federal, state and local, and all applicable foreign statutes, regulations and ordinances. In addition, our installation and other operations have to comply with various relevant occupational safety and health regulations, transportation regulations, code specifications, permit and licensing requirements and bonding and insurance requirements, as well as with fire regulations relating to the storage, handling and transporting of flammable materials. Our manufacturing and coatings facilities, as well as our installation and other operations, are subject to federal and state environmental protection regulations, none of which presently have any material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in connection with our present business. However, although our installation and other operations have established monitoring programs and safety procedures, further restrictions could be imposed on the manner in which installation and other activities are conducted, on equipment used in installation and other activities, on 
14

volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutant emissions from our paintings and coatings processes and on the use of solvents or the thermosetting resins used in the Insituform® CIPP process.
The use of both thermoplastics and thermosetting resin materials in contact with drinking water is strictly regulated in most countries. In the United States, a consortium led by NSF International, under arrangements with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), establishes minimum requirements for the control of potential human health effects from substances added indirectly to water via contact with treatment, storage, transmission and distribution system components, by defining the maximum permissible concentration of materials that may be leached from such components into drinking water, and methods for testing them. Our lining and coating products for drinking water use are NSF/ANSI Standard 61 compliant, including the entire Tyfo® system, the full range of Insituform® water pipe lining products and our Fusible C-900® and Fusible C-905® products. In addition, our Tite Liner® HDPE system is certified to NSF/ANSI Standard 61. Corrpro’s corrosion control products are NSF/ANSI Standard 61 classified for drinking water systems and its cathodic protection solutions for water storage tanks and water treatment units are compliant with AWWA Standard D104 and NACE recommended practices. NSF assumes no liability for use of any products, and NSF’s arrangements with the EPA do not constitute the EPA’s endorsement of NSF, NSF’s policies or its standards. Dedicated equipment is needed in connection with use of these products in drinking water applications.
