 General Overview
Our company was incorporated in the Province of British Columbia on December 10, 1996 as Green Point Resources Inc. On October 18, 2000, we changed our name to Wildcard Wireless Solutions Inc. On June 30, 2001, we filed Articles of Continuance in the Province of Alberta and became an Alberta corporation. On that same day, we conducted an amalgamation with Wildcard Communications Canada Inc., an Alberta corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary, wherein Wildcard Communications Canada was merged into Wildcard Wireless Solutions Inc. On June 20, 2003, we changed our name to TransAKT Corp. We chd our name from TransAKT Corp. to TransAKT Ltd. on July 12, 2006. Effective December 2, 2011, following approval by our shareholders on November 17, 2011, we re-domesticated our company from the Province of Alberta, Canada and became a Nevada corporation. 
 We have operated principally as a research and development company since our inception. Initial seed capital has been directed toward areas of product research and development, patent filings and administration. We initially focused on the research, design, development and manufacturing of mobile payment terminals. However, the sale of these payment terminals reached its end-of-life due to changes in cellular phone regulations and limited acceptance in the marketplace.
 In October 2004, we purchased the existing business and certain assets of IP Mental Inc., a Taiwan-based Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) hardware and software provider. On November 15, 2006, we acquired Taiwan Halee International Co. Ltd. (HTT), a Taiwan-based leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of telecommunications equipment, including specialized VoIP-compatible phone systems. These acquisitions were intended to enable us to remain competitive in the marketplace by engaging in the design, development, manufacturing and sale of telecommunications equipment, including VoIP compatible telephone systems and multi-line cordless telephone systems. 

 On November 15, 2006, we acquired HTT, for the sum of USD$5,000,000. The purchase price was paid by the delivery to the shareholders of HTT of: (i) USD$200,000 in cash; (ii) USD$300,000 in a promissory note from us due in cash six months after closing; (iii) 50,000,000 of our common voting shares, with a deemed value of USD$0.09 per share; and (iv) 5,000,000 of our common voting shares issued to our president and chief executive officer, Mr. James Wu, as performance-based compensation. We have mainly financed our operations through the use of debt and the issuance of equity in private placements. In October 2006, we repaid a loan that we had taken against inventory produced to fund our first commercial run of our payment terminals. We settled the loan for USD$90,000 using funds raised from the private placement of our shares. We continue to finance our operations through debt or equity financing and intend to do so until our sales are sufficient to fund our operations, 
  On August 12, 2010, we filed a Form S-4 Registration Statement in connection with the continuation of our company from Alberta to Nevada. We registered 102,645,120 shares of common stock of TransAKT Ltd. (Nevada) which were issued to the shareholders of TransAKT Ltd. (Alberta) on a one-for-one basis to the number of shares held by them.
  Effective June 25, 2012, the Nevada Secretary of State accepted for filing of a certificate of amendment, wherein, we amended our articles of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 300,000,000 to 700,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.001 per share. Our preferred stock remains unchanged.
  On May 3, 2012, we entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement with Vegfab Agricultural Technology Co. Ltd. (“Vegfab”), a Taiwanese corporation, pursuant to which we intended to acquire the material assets of Vegfab. Vegfab is in the business of manufacturing innovative indoor agricultural equipment used to grow a large variety of vegetables and fruit using simulated sunlight from LED lamps in a proprietary hydroponic system. Vegfab’s product line includes systems for commercial production and a home growing system which allows families to grow safe and clean fruit and vegetables in their own homes. Prior to completion of the transaction we and Vegfab elected instead to proceed by way of a share purchase and, effective July 16, 2012, we acquired all outstanding securities of Vegfab. In consideration of the Vegfab securities, we had paid $1,000,000 in cash and issued 150,000,000 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Vegfab which constituted approximately 37.2% of our common stock at the time of closing. As a result of the transaction Vegfab became our wholly owned subsidiary and primary business unit. Vegfab has since become engaged in the operation of a plant factory in Taiwan for the production of pesticide-free vegetables. 
  Previously, we entered into a performance compensation agreement dated June 15, 2006 with James Wu, our president and chief executive officer, pursuant to which our company was required to pay Mr. Wu share compensation of 10% of the value of any venture acquisition that Mr. Wu secured for our company. As a result, in July 2012, we issued to Mr. Wu 18,333,333 shares of our company’s common stock with respect to the acquisition of Vegfab. 
  On January 4, 2013, we entered into a share purchase and sale agreement with Mr. Pan Yen Chu pursuant to which we sold to Mr. Pan 100% of all issued and outstanding securities in our wholly owned subsidiary HTT. In consideration of the sale of HTT, Mr. Pan has transferred to our company 45,000,000 previously issued common voting shares of our company with a deemed value of $0.04 per share or $1.8 million in the aggregate. The transfer of common shares was completed on January 7, 2013. In connection with the sale HTT, the 45,000,000 common shares of our company received as consideration will be returned to treasury. The 45,000,000 shares constitute approximately 11.5% of our company’s currently issued and outstanding common stock. 
  On October 30, 2013, Million Talented Ltd., a related party 50% owned by the Company’s president and director, contributed $516 (equals to HKD 4,000) to obtain 40% ownership of TransAKT Bio Agritech Ltd., formerly named as TransAKT (H.K) Ltd., (“TransAKT H.K.”). TransAKT H.K. was incorporated in Hong Kong on November 20, 2007. It had no operation until 2013. TransAKT H.K.'s primary business is conducting research and development on new agricultural technology relating to the Company’s business. On May 6, 2015, the Company acquired the remaining 40% of the TransAKT H.K. from Million Talented Ltd. As such, The Company wholly owned its subsidiary of TransAKT BIO Agritech Ltd. And it becomes our primary business unit.

 On June 30, 2015, our wholly owned subsidiary, TransAKT Taiwan Ltd., entered into a Share Transfer Agreement among Vegfab Agricultural Technology Co. Ltd. and a third party pursuant to which the third party acquired 100% of of Vegfab Agricultural Technology Co. Ltd. in consideration of $100,000. Vegfab Agricultural Technology Co. Ltd. was the sole material asset of TransAKT Taiwan Ltd. and its parent company (and subsidiary of the Company), TransAKT Holdings Ltd., a Turks and Caicos company. Subsequent to the sale of Vegfab Agricultural Technology Co. Ltd., pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated June 30, 2015 with the Company’s former President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, the Company sold TransAKT Holdings Ltd. (and its subsidiary, TransAKT Taiwan Ltd.) to the former (non-affiliated) officer and director in consideration of $100,000. All intercompany debts between TransAKT Holdings Ltd. and the formerly affiliated companies were cancelled as a result of the transaction.
  A 20 to 1 reversed stock split was approved by the Board of Directors on November 9, 2015, by majority of shareholders on April 1, 2016, by FINRA on June 20, 2016 and effective on June 23, 2016. The issued and outstanding common stock was consolidated from 613,447,306 to 30,672,404 with fractional share round up to 1 share. 
  Overview of our Operations
  We began operations in 1997 and commercialized our first product line of wireless point-of-sale (“WPOS”) terminals in April 2003. With the use of cellular phones, these terminals allow merchants to accept payments anywhere, anytime. However, our WPOS terminals were discontinued due to changes in cellular phone regulations and limited acceptance in the marketplace. In October 2004, through the acquisition of the business and certain assets of IP Mental Inc., we entered the VoIP business. On November 15, 2006, we acquired Taiwan Halee International Co. Ltd. (“HTT”), a Taiwan-based leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of telecommunications equipment, including specialized VoIP-compatible phone systems. These acquisitions were intended to enable us to remain competitive in the VoIP marketplace by engaging in the design, development, manufacturing and sale of telecommunications equipment, including VoIP compatible telephone systems and multi-line cordless telephone systems. 
  Effective July 16, 2012, we acquired all outstanding securities of Vegfab Agricultural Technology Co. Ltd. (“Vegfab”), a Taiwanese corporation, With the acquisition of Vegfab we entered the business of manufacturing agricultural equipment used to grow a large variety of vegetables and fruit using simulated sunlight from LED lamps in a proprietary hydroponic system. Vegfab’s product line includes systems for commercial production and a home growing system which allows families to grow safe and clean fruit and vegetables in their own homes. Vegfab subsequently became engaged in the operation of a plant factory in Taiwan for the production of pesticide-free vegetables. 
  Concurrently with our acquisition of Vegfab, our management began planning our exit from the VoIP telecommunications business owing to diminishing growth opportunities for our Company in that industry. Subsequently, on January 4, 2013, we entered into a share purchase and sale agreement with Mr. Pan Yen Chu pursuant to which we sold to Mr. Pan 100% of all issued and outstanding securities in our wholly owned subsidiary HTT in consideration for the cancellation and return to treasury of 45,000,000 previously issued common voting shares of our company with a deemed value of $0.04 per share or $1.8 million in the aggregate. The transfer of common shares was completed on January 7, 2013. On September 27, 2016, the company cancelled these treasury stocks of 45,000,000 shares amounted to $1.8 million in the aggregate.
  As a result of our sale of HTT, Vegfab Agricultural Technology Co. Ltd. became our primary business unit. However, due to recurring losses from operations and in order to conserve operating resources, our management decided to sell the Vegfab on June 30, 2015.
  Subsequent to our sale of Vegfab, we continue to be engaged in the sale and distribution of indoor agricultural equipment, including lighting, irrigation and hydroponic growing systems. We purchase inventory from third party manufacturers and re-sell equipment to various indoor agricultural operators located in Asia. Our primary markets are Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Singapore.

On July 15, 2016 we entered into Securities Purchase Agreement with our President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Ho Kang-Wing, pursuant to which we issued to Mr. Ho a Convertible Promissory Note (the Note) in consideration of $1,000,000 in cash proceeds. The Note bears interest at the rate of 8% per annum and may be prepaid in whole or in part without penalty before the maturity date of July 14, 2018. At the option of the Holder, the outstanding principal and accrued interest underlying Note may be converted from time, on or following the maturity date, into common shares of our Company at the price of $0.01 per share. 
 On February 28, 2017, Mr. Ho Kangwing (the holder of convertible promissory note) elected to convert the entire outstanding amount of the Note into 105,066,666 common shares of the Company including the accumulated interest. Therefore, the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company were increased to 133,506,570 shares at that date. 
 We have operating losses of $208,310 and $220,940 during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and incurred an accumulated deficit of $22,558,836 and $22,350,526 as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. In addition, we expect to incur an operating loss in 2019.
 Principal Products and Markets 
 In the recent years, we supplied indoor agricultural equipment to commercial products of fruits and vegetables. However, the innovation in the indoor agriculture market is primarily focus on combining different technologies in new ways. Our industry is undergoing a period of rapid innovation and growth. And there exists a vast number of companies which predate our company and which have greater financial resources and experience in the industry. Furthermore, we are undergoing a very long period of consumer education in the industry. It is a high consumption of resources and the public acceptance of the business model is limited. At this moment, we have not realized commercial success of the technologies. Therefore, we have to seek for other development opportunities for our company. 
 As at the date of this annual report, we are actively seeking opportunities to diversify our business and to enhance shareholder value. In particular, we are investigating potential opportunities to enter the Chinese health food market, with an emphasis on traditional Chinese herbs known as cordyceps. In that regard, we have recently identified and are in negotiations with a potential joint-venture partner engaged in research, manufacture, processing and sales of cordyceps. Importantly, however, there is no guarantee that our negotiations will be successful or that we will successfully identify or secure other opportunities to diversify our business.
 Subsidiaries 
 We have one wholly owned subsidiary, TransAKT (BVI) Ltd. Which holds 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of TransAKT Bio Agritech Ltd., its primary business is conducting research and development on new agricultural technology and marketing the products for the Company. Other than holding the shares of TransAKT Bio Agritech Ltd., TransAKT (BVI) Ltd. is non-active.
