Recent Developments Related to the COVID-19 Outbreak
 
All of the disclosures set forth in Item 1 below should be read in the context of the recent COVID-19 related developments discussed immediately below.  All of the disclosures recited in “Recent Developments Related to the COVID-19 Outbreak” are as of the date of this filing.
 
The occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to negatively affect our operations depending on the severity and longevity of the pandemic.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic is currently impacting countries, communities, supply chains, and businesses as well as the global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in in social distancing, travel bans, and quarantine measures, which have limited access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff, and professional advisors. These factors, in turn, have impacted and may continue to impact our operations, financial condition, and demand for our goods and services as well as our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic has hampered and may continue to hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the SEC. Depending on the severity and longevity of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business, customers, and shareholders may continue to experience a significant negative impact.
 
With the vaccination of multiple employees and as the State of California reduces restrictions, our sales, administrative, and accounting employees have returned to our main office. We are continuing our extended cleaning efforts and restrictions on the number of customers allowed inside the facility at a time. Shop employees are servicing contracts with our essential customers and are often traveling to do so. All employees are practicing social distancing.
 
In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we received the following financial assistance from the Small Business Administration (SBA):
 

(1) | $228,442 under the SBA Paycheck Protection Program 442 to cover payroll and utility expenses. We received 100% forgiveness of this loan; 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | $150,000 under the COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan. On April 7, 2021 we received email notification of an increase in this loan from $150,000 to $500,000. That same day, we submitted our request for the increase; and 


(3) | $254,147 under the SBA Paycheck Protection Program – Round 2 442 to cover payroll and utility expenses. We believe we are following the government guidelines and tracking costs to ensure 100% forgiveness of the loan;

Governmental Regulation
 
We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local rules and regulations, including regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and similar state agencies with respect to storing, shipping, disposing, discharging, and manufacturing hazardous materials and hazardous and non-hazardous waste. These activities are associated with the repair and maintenance of our equipment and customers’ equipment. Compliance with these rules and regulations has not had any material effect on our operations, nor do we expect it to in the future. Further, we have not made, and do not anticipate making, any material capital expenditures in compliance with environmental regulations. However, there can be no assurance that these expectations will prove to be accurate, particularly if regulations change, unforeseen incidents occur or unknown past contamination or non-compliance is discovered, among other similar events.
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) as we did not have more than $1,070,000,000 in annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as of December 31, 2020, our last fiscal year.
 
We may lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year during which (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1,070,000,000 or (ii) we issue more than $1,070,000,000 in non-convertible debt in a three-year period. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company if at any time we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement.
 
As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable to generally reporting companies. These provisions include:
 

● | a requirement to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in a public offering registration statement;

History
 
We have grown from a used forklift dealer in Northern California to the owner and operator of a multi-million dollar fleet of heavy equipment for sale, lease, or rent to companies in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Asia, and Africa.
 
We have three business units:
 
1. Hamre Equipment;
 2. Hamre Heavy Haul; and
 3. Hamre Parts & Service.
 
These units are authorized dealers for well-known equipment manufacturers and carry a large inventory of heavy equipment and Hamre Parts & Service includes a complete maintenance organization with a large parts inventory and service department.
 
We supply heavy equipment to many different industries. Currently, the majority of our revenue is from the sales of new and refurbished container handlers to portside logistics companies. In addition to this line of work, we have an extensive equipment inventory for infrastructure development. Growing demand for infrastructure development typically calls for equipment to be rented, rather than purchased, allowing us to maximize the use of our inventory.
 
The Hamre Heavy Haul business unit includes a customized fleet of heavy haul equipment and was initially formed to transfer heavy equipment for us, however, in recent years, we have expanded this unit to market our heavy haul services to third-party companies throughout the United States.
 
Strategy
 
We have a clearly defined strategy to find opportunities that expand our reach within the United States and internationally. We now have customers in over 12 countries. As we continue to sell new equipment to U.S. customers, we purchase older equipment from well-respected brands that may not meet EPA Tier III requirements in the U.S., and refurbish the equipment to like-new condition. The equipment is sold AS IS with NO warranty agreement. The equipment is then marketed internationally. Our target markets for sales of new and refurbished equipment are:

• | Canada
--+-------


• | Indonesia
--+----------


• | Pakistan
--+---------


• | Germany
--+--------


• | Singapore
--+----------


• | Vietnam
--+--------


• | China
--+------


• | Russia
--+-------


• | India
--+------


• | The Middle East
--+----------------


• | West Africa
--+------------


• | Central America
--+----------------


• | Mexico
--+-------

Opportunities
 
We believe the demand for leased or rented equipment is growing. Companies within the construction and logistics industries hesitate to purchase equipment that may become idle if related markets weaken. Additionally, the cost of many types of heavy-duty equipment and container handlers has increased substantially because of new federal emission control standards. Due to these and other concerns, many companies forgo purchasing and instead rent or lease needed equipment.
 
Internationally, our ongoing expansion, specifically within Western Africa, allows us to take advantage of the improving global infrastructure construction market and the increased import and export of natural resources. We have already established marketing opportunities within the governments of several West African countries.

The current trade issues with China have no bearing on our business or current plans. However, trade issues between the United States and China are constantly evolving and the future could bring about potential negative impacts on our business, including increased costs and higher prices.
 
Market
 
Our market is highly competitive and constantly changing. Commercial success is frequently dependent upon capital availability, the effectiveness and sufficiency of which are very difficult to accurately predict. It is one of the principal economic risks of companies in our industry.
 
According to the “Heavy Construction Equipment Market Will Reach $90.4 Billion by 2025,” published by Grand View Research in January 2019/2020 (the “Construction Equipment Report”): The global heavy construction equipment market size is expected to reach $90.4 billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 5.4%. Increased investment of infrastructure will be a major factor in driving market growth.
 
Competition
 
There are a large number of companies and individuals engaged in the provision of construction equipment; accordingly, there is a high degree of competition in our industry. Many of the companies and individuals with whom we compete have substantially greater technical, personnel, and financial resources than us. In view of our limited financial resources, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
 
According to the Construction Equipment Report, global vendors such as Caterpillar, Komatsu Ltd., and AB Volvo are some of the leading market players in the heavy equipment industry. These vendors dominate the market in terms of technology, experience, and quality.
 
A rise in prominence of Chinese vendors in the industry has been observed in the last few years. Manufacturers in China have capitalized on government-funded infrastructure projects and are continuously evolving and in some circumstances, acquiring European vendors.
 
Some other key players in the market for heavy duty construction equipment are Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. Ltd., Liebherr, Deere & Company, Doosan Bobcat, XCMG Group, SANY Group, and Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology Co. Ltd.
 

Amount Spent on Research and Development None. Employees As of the date hereof, we have 19 full time and 2 part time employees. In addition to our employees, we utilize various consultants and contractors for other services on an as-needed basis.
