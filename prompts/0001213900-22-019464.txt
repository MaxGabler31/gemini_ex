Item 1. Business



Generation Hemp, Inc. (the “Company”), was incorporated on August 21, 2021 in the State of Delaware. The Company was originally incorporated on July 28, 2008 in the State of Colorado. On November 27, 2019, Home Treasure Finders, Inc. (“HTF”) acquired approximately 94% of the common stock of Energy Hunter Resources, Inc. (“EHR”) in a series of transactions accounted for as a reverse merger (the “Transaction”). Upon closing of the Transaction, HTF changed its name to Generation Hemp, Inc.



On January 11, 2021, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Halcyon Thruput, LLC (“Halcyon”). With this acquisition, we commenced providing post-harvest and midstream services to growers by drying, processing, cleaning and stripping harvested hemp directly from the field and wetbaled at our 48,000 square foot leased facility located in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Additionally, the Company offers safe storage services for processed hemp, which enables farmers to maximize strategic market timing. In August 2021, the Company launched its small animal bedding consumer goods product line (“Rowdy Rooster”) made from the hemp hurd byproduct that is produced from its hemp processing operations.



We also generate revenue from rental of our “Cannabis Zoned” (Hemp) warehouse property located in Denver, Colorado currently leased to an unaffiliated hemp seed company.



As of December 31, 2021, EHR held an approximate 8% working interest in an oil & gas property located in Cochran County, Texas within the Slaughter-Levelland Field of the San Andres formation in the Northwest Shelf of West Texas. EHR’s oil & gas activities are currently held for sale and are presented in these consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for each of the periods presented.



Our management team has been and continues to actively review acquisition candidates involved in the hemp industry that operate within a number of vertical businesses, predominantly within the midstream sector that are attractive to us and are within the hemp supply chain.



To fund our business activities, we have historically completed a number of private placements of equity and debt. We continue to seek additional public or private placements of our stock and debt. Our common shares are quoted on the OTCQB Markets under the symbol “GENH.”



Principal Services and their Markets



Generation Hemp is positioning itself to be a pure-play, fully integrated hemp company through its acquisitions of existing established companies operating in the rapidly growing hemp sector with success as profitable first movers.



We provide post-harvest and midstream services to growers by drying, processing, cleaning, stripping harvested hemp directly from the field and wetbaled at our leased 48,000 square foot facility located in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The drying services technology greatly increases efficiency and capacity during harvest for farmers who need to quickly move harvested hemp while preserving the cannabinoid potency by providing scalable infrastructure essential to receive and process hemp with high moisture content (“wet”) quickly. Additionally, the Company offers safe storage services for processed hemp, which enables farmers to maximize strategic market timing. The midstream business is fee income oriented, based upon a price per pound of material handled, and therefore is more protected from significant commodity price variations. The facility is able to process approximately 10,000 wet pounds per hour and the potential to scale up to 20,000 wet pounds per hour in order to meet market demands as licensed and harvested hemp acreage continues to increase across Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, and other states.



We also own one industrial warehouse located in Denver, Colorado and lease 100% of this space within that project to aid a licensed hemp seed grower. We exercise appropriate and reasonable care to screen our tenants, require and verify that our tenants maintain proper licenses and operate in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations at the federal, state, and local level.



We may own properties for our own investment account and as such are solely at financial risk in connection with our investments. In the event we utilize funds loaned to us by third party groups, they may in some circumstances share certain risks.

We do not grow, distribute or sell any form of cannabis. We have no present plan to engage in such activities or obtain a license to do so, now, or in the future. We currently plan to only operate in the hemp space. We are in the process of expanding our operations into other states, predominantly Kentucky and North Carolina.



Marketing of our Services



The market, clients, customers and distribution methods for hemp services and hemp-based products are large and diverse. These markets range from hemp mid-stream services for hemp growers/farmers, to hemp derived products like bioplastics, textiles, building materials, food additives, and dietary supplements.  Awareness and demand continue to grow for “green,” environmentally-friendly products derived from hemp, and the consumer market has already begun to integrate hemp products and products that contain hemp derivatives to existing product lines.  The distribution system is constantly evolving as small retailers, retail chains, and big box stores become increasingly educated on and familiar/comfortable with hemp and its derivatives.  The current market is focused on one of the cannabinoids derived from hemp called cannabidiol (“CBD”) and consumer goods that contain CBD. Additionally, consumer awareness followed by increased demand continues to drive and even force companies to make room on their shelves for hemp and products with hemp derivatives.  For products with hemp derivatives like CBD, direct to consumer Ecommerce through online store sales remains the main source of revenue for consumer goods companies, accounting for reported percentages of approximately 70-80% of sales.  



The Company continues to implement a plan to become more diversified within the midstream market.  Our marketing efforts began with a grass roots approach in order to meet with farmers, growers, and seed operations that would benefit from midstream services.  To supplement the grass roots outreach, we built our online web presence to reflect our desire to educate, to become a contributor and part of the hemp community, and also to act as a pioneer company to connect investors in the U.S. public markets to a hemp education and platform that is dually informed. 



We maintain and update our website and engage on social media platforms to market our ongoing hemp sector efforts.  We use globally distributed YouTube video ad campaigns to increase our brand awareness and encourage markets and the investment community to learn more about the hemp space. These videos have been played on several business sites such as CNBC, MSNBC, Fox News, Fox Business, Yahoo Finance, among others.  We have also begun to market a version of “Fireside Chats” from our Chairman and CEO to talk about various topics of interest in the hemp space.  These video segments will post on our social media platforms and they will also be used to create awareness campaigns that should have a global outreach.  In order to reach region specific growers/farmers in hemp, we have teed up direct mail marketing materials which prove effective for service markets within a specified radius.  These materials will serve as invitations to the farmers and growers in areas that the midstream services which we are acquiring will reach.  These are designed to add an identity to the midstream facility and provide an offer of help and partnership.  As we continue to become involved with additional verticals in the hemp supply chain, we will expand and tailor these marketing and advertising efforts to the specific needs of each segment. To-date all marketing, ad creation, ad campaigns, and creative work has been done internally and with a minimal budget. Upon the ease of COVID-19 restrictions, we began to increasingly pursue, attend, and present at, and/or exhibit in a number of industry tradeshows, and conferences and small cap investor conferences.



In 2021, we increased our marketing efforts by engaging several industry and investor media platforms by providing or collaborating on sponsored content in the form of articles, interviews, and podcasts in order to continue to educate the public and investors on the hemp industry and our company’s various products, services, and business plan. We have been featured on USA Today, Small Caps Daily, Benzinga, Reddit, and Cannabis Wealth Magazine. Gary C. Evans has also been a guest on KRLD News Radio Dallas to discuss the Company, along with several podcasts and webinars. We have also continued to build out our social media presence on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook (Meta), Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube. We are attempting to post video and/or static posts at least twice per week and designing content based on statistical data of engagement metrics – what content is trending, what users are most responsive to, and what times receive the most user reach and engagement. For reference, when comparing social media engagement from October 18, 2021 – December 28, 2021 to the same period for 2020, reach increased by 4,912% and engagement increased by 420% due to these efforts by management and the social media team.

Subsequent Events



Execution of “Gas Monkey” Merchandise Licensing Agreement - On February 17, 2022, Generation Hemp, Inc. executed a merchandise licensing agreement with world-renowned brand, Gas Monkey Garage. Generation Hemp will manufacture a USA grown hemp hurd spill absorbent and market this new product under the Gas Monkey brand name to consumers, retailers, and distributors as an environmentally sustainable, USA made, ultra-absorbent spill clean-up material. This will be Generation Hemp’s second environmentally sustainable consumer goods product line made from U.S. grown hemp hurd. Spill absorbents are typically used in garages, factories, or industrial settings to quickly contain spills of oil and other liquids. Spill absorbents are also used at the site of auto accidents to quickly contain leaks of oil and other fluids due to collisions.



Richard Rawlings, owner and founder of Gas Monkey Garage, is the star of the international hit series’ “Fast N’ Loud” & “Garage Rehab” spanning 17+ seasons and 200+ episodes. Mr. Rawlings and Gas Monkey have migrated the show to an online platform and consistently produce new episodes that premiere every week on YouTube and Facebook. With his experience of owning and running a garage for over 18 years, Richard Rawlings found the sustainable spill absorbent to be of great significance.



There are several types of spill absorbents with varying characteristics. These are in three general categories – mineral based, animal or vegetable based, and synthetic or organic polymers. The challenge in choosing an absorbent is finding an effective absorbent that does not pose a threat to health or the environment, whether that threat is posed when that material is procured or used. For example, a widely used spill absorbent material in products is Bentonite Clay. This is often a very dusty material and has warnings of containing unsafe levels of lead (FDA) and is associated with a number of health complaints in humans.



Generation Hemp, Inc. tested its U.S. grown and milled hemp hurd against currently used absorbents on the market and the findings showed it to have as effective or more effective absorbency and ability to contain spills.



Joint-Venture With Crypt Solutions, Inc. to Utilize Hemp Hurd Biomass as Biofuel to Power Bitcoin Mining – On January 16, 2022, Generation Hemp, Inc. and Crypt Solutions, Inc., DBA Cryptech Solutions (“Crypt”) a leading player in the cryptocurrency space, executed a Memorandum of Understanding and Letter of Intent to build “Green Energy” plants and Bitcoin mining complexes that will utilize hemp feedstock as a fuel source to power Bitcoin mining equipment and offset the draw on power from the local utility. Plans for this complex also include Generation Hemp’s additional hemp drying and processing facilities.



With theincreasing adoption and integration of cryptocurrency in mainstream channels and throughout the global economy, there has been an enormous draw on the energy grid for powering the necessary data processing equipment required to maintain these cryptocurrency mining systems 24/7. Generation Hemp, Inc. and Crypt Solutions, Inc. have begun to assemble the necessary pieces of a diversified “Green Energy” plant to create an independent power source for the primary purpose of powering Bitcoin mining in an effort to resolve any added pressure on the electrical grid. Environmentally sustainable hemp, a green feedstock, will be used for Btu generation to offset the draw of electricity from local utility companies. The Btu generation of hemp is comparable to wood biomass Btu generation. The utilization of solar power to complement the system will also be explored. Generation Hemp currently plans to explore harnessing the high levels of heat generated from the data processing operations produced from Bitcoin mining equipment to redistribute that heat as supplemental Btus to dry hemp.



As a renewable energy source with the utilization of hemp feedstock for fuel, all steps will be taken to register these facilities for Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) once completed and operational. Contributing renewable, “Green Energy” to the overall electrical grid will help electric power suppliers stay in compliance with state initiatives that require a certain percentage of their electricity to come from renewable energy, which helps foster and develop the infrastructure and implementation of renewable energy.



On February 23, 2022, Generation Hemp, Inc. and Crypt executed their first Letter of Intent that specifically applies to their joint Green Energy project, to be located adjacent to Generation Hemp’s wholly-owned subsidiary, GENH Halcyon Acquisition’s current hemp processing facility in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. This first project is being designed for two (2) megawatts of Bitcoin mining, which will include approximately 576 mining machines. The Bitcoin mining installation is expected to be running prior to the end of the second quarter 2022. Initial electricity needs for the project will come from the grid or the existing electricity provider until such time as biomass or other renewable methods are installed.

Competition



The hemp industry and hemp-based consumer product industry is highly competitive and fragmented in its nascency with numerous companies, consisting of publicly (mostly Canadian) and privately-owned companies. There are also large, well-funded companies beginning to emerge in the U.S. with a similar intention as Generation Hemp; to consolidate and vertically integrate along the hemp supply chain through acquisitions. These companies have indicated their intention to compete in the hemp industry and hemp-based product category. However, certain holding companies such as Acreage Holdings (domiciled in British Columbia) also include cannabis companies in their portfolio, whereas Generation Hemp is currently hemp only. We routinely evaluate internal and external opportunities to optimize value for shareholders through market research, strategic relationships and/or partnerships, and by asset acquisitions. Based upon our management team experience, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize in the growing hemp industry and hemp-based product industry. 



There are several companies developing hemp-based products and materials that will potentially displace existing products and materials sourced from less sustainable or less environmentally friendly sources. These hemp-based products are developing in the markets of textiles, building materials, biofuels, as food additives, skin care topicals and other therapeutics, and dietary supplements. Also, it is thought that cannabinoids derived from hemp can be used as therapeutics for a range of medical indications. The hemp-derived cannabinoid therapeutic market currently includes extracts of the hemp plant in several formulations, including proprietary formulations from several companies. These formulations include CBD and other cannabinoid such as,” CBG”, “CBC”, and “CBN” or a combination of several cannabinoids as the active ingredients. There are over one hundred different cannabinoids, therefore the market potential is only beginning to be realized. The therapeutics and supplement market are flooded with competition for hemp-based cannabinoid therapeutics. There are also companies that are using hemp-based cannabinoids as active ingredients in pharmaceutical formulations. Certain companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals plc have focused on plant-based CBD formulations; while other companies, such as Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Insys Therapeutics Inc., have focused on synthetic CBD formulations.



Our Competitive Strengths



We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:




● | Experienced and Committed Management Team. Gary C. Evans, our CEO, and other anticipated members of our senior management team have substantial experience in all aspects of growing a public company in a highly competitive sector, including acquisitions, dispositions, construction, development, management, finance and capital markets. Mr. Evans has previously been the Chairman and CEO of three different public companies that obtained financial success on the New York Stock Exchange. Additionally, he previously served as Chairman, CEO, and Lead Director of a NASDAQ listed company in the biopharmaceutical space for 24 years, having just resigned in 2021. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Focus on Consolidating Atomized Industry. Our focus on revenue generating and positive cash flow businesses is a key part of our growth strategy. Moreover, we believe the beginning of an entire new industry creates numerous opportunities to evaluate and consolidate very fragmented businesses. Our ultimate goal of being a more fully integrated enterprise within the midstream sector will eventually give us control of very profitable values chain and separate us from most of our competition. 
● | Demonstrated Investment and Capital Raising Acumen. We will continue to utilize rigorous underwriting standards for evaluating acquisitions and potential tenants to ensure that they meet our strategic and financial criteria. Our management team’s extensive experience and relationships established in mergers and acquisitions over the past 40 years and over 100 separate transactions should enable us to identify, negotiate and close on acquisitions cost effectively, efficiently, and with shareholder interest first in mind. 

Our Growth Strategy



Since the first harvests following the signing of the 2018 Farm Bill, the rush to capitalize on the hemp sector led to several pioneers launching a number of businesses within each vertical – many with very little capital resources available to them. Today:

● | The strong have survived 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Hemp/CBD space is ripe for consolidation 
● | Time for expansion and more vertical integration 
● | Seasoned business professionals have now begun to enter the space

Generation Hemp has taken a boots-on-the-ground approach to its analysis of the overall industry and due diligence on specific businesses. We believe there are currently significant opportunities to grow a vertically integrated hemp business by executing the following elements of our strategy:




● | rigorous, hands-on vetting process to enable our management to meet with target companies’ teams all across the country

Intellectual Property



As a company within the hemp industry, one of the fastest growing new industries in the United States, our current initial effort is to protect and distinguish our company and brand identity amidst other entities currently operating within and entering the space.
Governmental Regulation



We are subject to local and federal laws in our operating jurisdictions. We will hold required licenses for product production and distribution to the extent that our business requires and will monitor changes in laws, regulations, treaties and agreements.



The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 known as the “2018 Farm Bill,” is United States federal legislation signed into law on December 20, 2018, which provides much of the legal framework for the hemp-based CBD product category. The 2018 Farm Bill permanently removed “hemp” from the purview of the Controlled Substances Act, and accordingly, the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) no longer has any claim to interfere with the interstate commerce of hemp products. Some of the immediate impact from this legislation includes the ability for farmers to access crop insurance and U.S. Department of Agriculture programs for certification and competitive grants. While the DEA is now officially not involved in hemp regulation, the FDA retains its authority to regulate ingestible and topical products, including those that contain hemp and hemp extracts such as CBD.



A range of federal regulations govern any potential product development, manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing, including the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the “DSHEA”). Under DSHEA, supplements are effectively regulated by the FDA for Good Manufacturing Practices under 21 CFR Part 111. DSHEA defines a “dietary supplement” as a product intended to supplement the diet that contains one or more of the following: (a) a vitamin; (b) a mineral; (c) an herb or other botanical; (d) an amino acid; (e) a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or (f) a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described in clause (a) through (e). Thus, the law permits a wide range of dietary ingredients in dietary supplements, including CBD which is an extract of a botanical (Cannabis sativa L. plant). CBD also falls under clause (e) as it is a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake.



Markets and Distribution Methods



The market, customers and distribution methods for hemp-based products are large and diverse. These markets range from hemp-based bio plastics to textiles. This is an ever-evolving distribution system that today includes early adopter retailers and ecommerce entities, and product development companies. We believe that as awareness grows for the “green”, environmentally-friendly products derived from hemp/cannabis, the consumer market will continue to adapt its current product lines to integrate them with hemp-based additives or replace harmful components in their existing products with certain components of hemp.
Environmental Matters



Compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.
Employees



We had 11 employees as of December 31, 2021, including our named executive officers. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages related to labor relation issues. We believe we have good relations with our employees. We also utilize seasonal part-time employees during peak processing season and contractors to provide certain specialized skills and expertise that may be required from time to time.
