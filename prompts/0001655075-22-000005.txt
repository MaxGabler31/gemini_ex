Item 1. Business
Armstrong Flooring, Inc. is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2015. 
We are a leading global producer of resilient flooring products for use primarily in the construction and renovation of commercial, residential and institutional buildings. We design, manufacture, source and sell flooring products primarily in North America and the Pacific Rim. As of December 31, 2021, we operated seven manufacturing plants in three countries, including five manufacturing plants located throughout the U.S. (Illinois, Mississippi, Oklahoma and two in Pennsylvania) and one plant each in China and Australia. 
On April 1, 2016, we became an independent company as a result of the Separation which was effected by the Distribution. The Spin-off resulted in AFI and AWI becoming two independent, publicly traded companies, with AFI owning and operating the Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments and AWI continuing to own and operate a ceilings business.
On December 31, 2018, we sold our Wood Flooring business to an affiliate of AIP.
During early 2020, we established a multi-year strategic roadmap to transform and modernize our operations to become a leaner, faster-growing and more profitable business. The transformation encompasses three critical objectives: (i) expanding customer reach; (ii) simplifying product offerings and operations; and (iii) strengthening core capabilities. In addition, we have implemented a new operating model that we believe will more effectively accomplish these objectives by: (i) placing customers first by aligning services and products through a more seamless value chain; (ii) aiming to lead the industry in product innovation; (iii) simplifying processes and operating complexity to become more competitive and efficient; (iv) realigning the go-to-market model to reach all relevant channels and customers; (v) implementing system changes to improve operations, reduce costs and reignite organic growth; and (vi) investing thoughtfully with a return-focused mindset. The goal of this focused strategy is to transform and modernize AFI, resulting in a company that is more agile, faster-growing and more profitable. 
On December 31, 2021, following our Board's determination that a sale of the Company or other strategic transaction, if completed, would be in the best interests of the Company and the best means to maximize value for the Company's stockholders and other stakeholders, we announced that we had initiated a process for the potential sale of the Company and consideration of other strategic alternatives.
Markets
We hold leadership or significant market share positions in the majority of the product categories and markets in which we operate. We compete exclusively in the resilient flooring product category in North America and the Pacific Rim. The majority of our sales are in North America, where we serve both commercial and residential markets. In the Pacific Rim, we are principally focused on commercial markets. Our business operates in a competitive environment across all our product categories and excess capacity exists in much of the industry.  The major markets in which we compete are: 
North American Commercial — Our products are used in commercial, institutional buildings and multi-family housing. Our revenue opportunities come from new construction as well as renovation of existing buildings. Industry analysts estimate that renovation work represents the majority of the total North American commercial market opportunity. Most of our revenue comes from three major end markets of commercial building: education, healthcare and retail. During 2020, we positioned our entry into the Hospitality vertical, which represents an incremental growth opportunity, and recorded our first sales in this vertical towards the end of 2021. We monitor U.S. construction starts and follow project activity. Our revenue from new construction can lag behind construction starts by as much as twenty-four months given that the installation of flooring typically occurs later in the construction process. We also monitor architectural activity, GDP and general employment levels, which can indicate movement in renovation and new construction opportunities. We believe that these statistics, taking into account the time-lag effect, provide a reasonable indication of our future revenue opportunity from commercial renovation and new construction. We also believe that consumer preferences for product type, style, color, availability, performance attributes and affordability significantly affect our revenue.
North American Residential — We sell products for use in single and multi-family housing. Homeowners, contractors, builders, and property management firms can choose from our innovative flooring products. We compete directly with other domestic and international suppliers of these products. Our flooring products also compete with carpet, stone, wood, laminate and ceramic products, which we do not offer.
Our products are used in new home construction and existing home renovation work. Industry analysts estimate that existing home renovation (also known as replacement/remodel) work represents a majority of the total North American residential market opportunity. We monitor key U.S. statistics including existing home sales (a key indicator for renovation opportunity), housing starts, housing completions, home prices, interest rates and consumer confidence. We believe there is some longer-term correlation between these statistics and our revenue after reflecting a lag period of several months between a change in these indicators and our operating results. However, we believe that consumers’ preferences for product type, style, color, availability, performance attributes and affordability also significantly affect our revenue. Further, changes in inventory levels and/or product focus at national home centers and independent wholesale flooring distributors can significantly affect our revenue.
Outside of North America — We also serve commercial markets in the Pacific Rim region with approximately 90% of the sales in this region coming from China and Australia. The commercial segments we serve are similar to the North American market (healthcare, education, and retail). However, there is a higher penetration of resilient flooring in the hospitality and infrastructure segments in China than in North America. For the countries where we have significant revenue, we monitor various national statistics (such as GDP) as well as construction data (starts and project-related information).
The following table provides an estimate of our net sales, by major markets(a): 

North American Commercial | North American Residential | Outside of North America (b) | Total 
New | Renovation | New | Renovation | New | Renovation | Commercial | Residential | Total
10% | 35% | 5% | 30% | 5% | 15% | 65% | 35% | 100% 

(a)  Management has estimated the above data as the ultimate end-use of our products is not easily determinable. Management believes these estimates to be consistent year-over-year.
(b)    The Company's sales outside of North America are primarily commercial.
Demand for our products is influenced by economic conditions. We closely monitor publicly available macroeconomic trend data that provides insight to commercial and residential market activity; this includes GDP growth indices, the Architecture Billings Index and the Consumer Confidence Index, as well as housing starts and existing home sales. In addition, our channel partners raise or lower their inventory levels according to their expectations of market demand and consumer preferences, which directly affects our sales. 
Products
LVT - LVT represents the fastest growing resilient flooring product category. Through enhanced wear layers and coatings, LVT delivers improved durability and lower maintenance over traditional vinyl tile. In addition, the utilization of advanced printing and embossing technology provides LVT with upgraded visual realism in a wide variety of attractive wood and stone designs. LVT’s modular format offers a wide range of installation options for the professional and do-it-yourself installer, with an enhanced ease of installation when compared to other products such as wood or ceramic tile; this can be seen with the growing popularity of floating and rigid LVT floors. The largest market for LVT is North America. We believe LVT growth has and will continue to come partially at the expense of other product categories in both the soft and hard surface flooring markets.
VCT - VCT is a flooring material composed of PVC chips formed into solid sheets and cut into modular shapes that offers a classic look and economical value. We are the largest producer of VCT which is primarily used in commercial environments. The market for VCT is mature and well-structured, but demand has softened due to customer trends that favor alternate products, including LVT.
Vinyl sheet - Vinyl sheet is a resilient flooring product that comes in a roll that is cut to size. Vinyl sheet performs in high-traffic settings and is low maintenance. Our product Rejuvenations™ Restore™ addresses heath care concerns of both comfort and sound. We produce and sell vinyl sheet product for both residential and commercial markets. We continue to experience a decline in demand for our traditional resilient products, particularly residential vinyl sheet products. The decline in vinyl sheet is driven by loss of market share to competitors as well as consumer trends that favor alternative products, including LVT. During 2020, we introduced the industry's first non-PVC vinyl sheet system, Medinpure™, for use in healthcare applications, which was recognized by many trade publications and industry organizations. 
Customers
We use our reputation, capabilities, service and brand recognition to develop long-standing relationships with our customers. We sell products through both independent wholesale flooring distributors, who re-sell our products to retailers, builders, contractors, installers and others as well as direct to specialty retailers. In the commercial sector, we also have important relationships with subcontractors’ alliances, large architectural firms, large design firms and major facility owners in our focus segments. In the North American retail channel, which sells to end-users in the residential and light commercial segments, we have important relationships with several national home centers and flooring retailers. Additionally, we also have important relationships with major home builders and retail buying groups in the North American residential sector. 
Approximately 69% of our consolidated net sales in 2021 were to distributors. Sales to large home centers accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated sales in 2021. Our remaining sales were primarily to other retailers, end-use customers and contractors. One customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated net sales in 2021. 
Approximately 75% of our consolidated net sales in 2020 were to distributors. Sales to large home centers accounted for approximately 16% of our consolidated sales in 2020. Our remaining sales were primarily to other retailers, end-use customers and contractors. One customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated net sales in 2020. 
The above changes in sales channels are attributable to our shift in go-to-market strategy, which aims to provide more service options for our customers. 
Competition
We face strong competition in all of our businesses. Principal attributes of competition include product performance, product styling, service and price. Competition in North America comes from both domestic and international manufacturers. Additionally, some of our products compete with alternative products or finishing solutions. Our resilient flooring products compete with carpet, stone, wood, ceramic products, rubber and stained or polished concrete. There is excess industry capacity for certain products in some geographies, which tends to increase price competition. The following companies (listed alphabetically) are our primary competitors: AHF LLC, Beaulieu International Group N.V., Creative Flooring Solution, Congoleum Corporation, Engineered Floors, LLC, Forbo Holding AG, Gerflor Group, HMTX Industries (including Metroflor Corporation), Interface, Inc. (including Nora Systems GmbH), LG Floors, Mannington Mills, Inc., Mohawk Industries, Inc., Shaw Industries, Inc. and Tarkett AG. We also compete with private label brokers.
Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business. The principal raw materials include: PVC resins and films, plasticizers, fiberglass and felt backings, limestone, pigments, inks, stabilizers and coatings. We also purchase significant amounts of packaging materials and consume substantial amounts of energy, such as electricity, natural gas and water.
In general, adequate supplies of raw materials are available. However, availability can change for a number of reasons, including environmental conditions, laws and regulations, shifts in demand by other industries competing for the same materials, transportation disruptions and/or business decisions made by, or events that affect, our suppliers. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy our requirements, we believe alternative supply arrangements would be available.
Prices for certain high usage raw materials can fluctuate dramatically. Cost increases for these materials can have a significant adverse impact on our manufacturing costs. During the fourth quarter of 2020 there was a resin shortage due to a hurricane and COVID-19. This caused a temporary increase in the price of resin, which is used to make PVC. Additionally, during 2021, the Company experienced supply chain disruptions and significant inflationary pressures related to critical raw materials. Certain raw materials, including PVC, plasticizer and CoPoly, have seen increases ranging from approximately 60% to 150% since January 2020. As a result, we instituted multiple price increases during 2021, the realization of which have lagged the increased input costs and have not been adequate to fully cover inflationary pressures. We will continue to monitor the larger macro-economic environment and will further adjust its pricing strategy as necessary. 
Sourced Products
Some of our products are sourced from third parties. Our primary sourced products include LVT, vinyl sheet, installation and maintenance materials and accessories. We purchase most of our sourced products from suppliers that are located outside of the U.S., primarily from Asia. Sales of sourced products represented approximately 43% of our total consolidated revenue in 2021. 
In general, adequate supplies of sourced products are available. However, availability can change for a number of reasons, including environmental conditions, laws and regulations including tariffs, production and transportation disruptions and/or business decisions made by, or events that affect, our suppliers. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy our requirements, we believe alternative supply arrangements would be available.
Shipping and Transportation
Recent trends in shipping continue to extend delivery times for certain products and materials, primarily from China and Vietnam. While we expect this to be temporary in nature, we cannot reasonably predict when the imbalance of global shipping capacity and demand will end. These global logistics and shipping challenges delayed a substantial number of anticipated order deliveries from the second and third quarter of 2021 until the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. 
In addition, increases in shipping costs have negatively impacted operating results. Certain shipping costs, including ocean freight, increased up to 350% since January 2020. As a result, we instituted multiple price increases during 2021, including the introduction of an ocean freight surcharge, the realization of which have lagged the increased input costs and have not been adequate to fully cover inflationary pressures. We will continue to monitor the larger macro-economic environment and will further adjust its pricing strategy as necessary. 
Tariffs
Tariffs impact the cost of products we import from China. The U.S. government announced a tariff of 10% on certain flooring products imported to the U.S. from China, effective on September 24, 2018 with an additional 15% effective on May 10, 2019. In order to partially offset the impact, we implemented price increases that went into effect in the fourth quarter of 2018, and additional price increases that went into effect in the second quarter of 2019 on select impacted products. On November 8, 2019, an exclusion on tariffs of certain flooring products was announced. The exclusion applied retroactively to September 24, 2018. Additional products were added to the exclusion in the second quarter of 2020, also retroactive to September 24, 2018. The exclusions expired in August 2020. We filed for tariff refunds on these products in 2020 and recorded refunds as a reduction of previously recorded expense once formal approval was received. Upon expiration of the exclusion in 2020, we implemented a price increase on select impacted products to offset the expense of the tariffs.
Seasonality
Generally, our sales in North America tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to more favorable weather conditions, customer business cycles and education renovations typical during the summer months. We see similar patterns with respect to our sales in the Pacific Rim, though the timing of the Chinese New Year can affect buying behaviors in the first fiscal quarter.
Patent and Intellectual Property Rights
Patent protection is important to our business. Our competitive position has been enhanced by U.S. and foreign patents on products and processes developed or perfected within AFI, including those before and after the Spin-off, or obtained through acquisitions and licenses. In addition, we benefit from our trade secrets for certain products and processes.
Patent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of a patent in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies. Although we consider that, in the aggregate, our patents, licenses and trade secrets constitute a valuable asset of material importance to our 
business, we do not regard any of our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent or trade secret or any group of related patents or trade secrets.
An example of patented technology includes Diamond 10® Technology, which is patented in the United States and certain other countries.
We own or have a license to use certain trademarks, including, but not limited to, without limitation, Armstrong®, Alterna®, BBT®, Diamond 10® Technology, Empower™, Excelon®, Imperial®, Initiator™, Inspiring Great Spaces®, Luxe Plank®, Medintech®, Empower™, Medinpure™, Memories™, Natural Creations®, NexProTM, NexproTM XMB, Rest & RefugeTM, Station Square™, StrataMax® and Vivero®, which are important to our business because of their significant brand name recognition. This includes the new Armstrong Flooring logos developed in 2020 to strengthen and differentiate the Armstrong Flooring brand. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as the mark is used and continues in other countries as long as the mark is registered. Registrations are generally for fixed, but renewable, terms.
Sustainability
We believe that a commitment to positive environmental and social practices strengthens our organization, increases our connection with our stakeholders and helps us better serve our customers and communities. Through these commitments which are embedded in our corporate strategy, we see additional ways to create value for our stockholders, our employees, our customers and the wider world. As part of this commitment, we focus on operating our global footprint with minimal impact on the environment and designing products with materials and processes that are safe for both people and the planet. As a company, we recover over 80% of our generated waste and operate a closed loop product take-back program which has recycled over 150 million pounds of post-consumer flooring (since program inception prior to the Spin-off). Solar installations at our China and Australia facilities have further reduced our carbon footprint. Water recirculation and rainwater harvesting projects have eliminated over 200 million gallons of water use since 2008. We provide our employees with ongoing support through education, training, development and leadership opportunities and we prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees, stakeholders and communities. We demonstrate our commitment to environmental and social matters in many ways. We published our first Sustainability Report in 2021, which can be found on our website at www.armstrongflooring.com.
There have been no, and we do not expect there to be in the near term, material impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations as a result of compliance with legislation or regulatory rules regarding climate change. Increased regulation and other climate change concerns, however, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, and we are not able to predict how such regulations or concerns would affect our business, operations or financial results.
Human Capital
Overview
We had 1,568 employees globally as of December 31, 2021. Our workforce spans 1,172 employees in the U.S. and the remainder in Canada, Australia, China, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam.
We are evolving our culture and our human capital strategies to best serve all these employees and align with our growth strategies and the changing social environments. Fostering a culture that is values-based, responsible, ethical and inclusive motivates and empowers our employees. This culture enables us to attract and retain the most talented people, engage them in meaningful and inspiring work and, as a result, fulfill our business goals and objectives. Our human capital philosophy is simple: Invest in people and they will return your investment in dividends. We grow together, encouraging one another to develop our own unique skills and celebrating each individual’s uniqueness, to find fulfillment, success and advancement.
Health and Safety
A key focus of our shared community is on the health, safety and well-being of our employees. We engage in continuous physical safety programs throughout our manufacturing facilities and provide mental and physical well-being programs to all employees. We have continued measures to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure employee health, safety and well-being. 
Talent Development
We recognize that in order to drive innovation and operational excellence, we must attract, develop, motivate and retain diverse, world-class talent. Through the execution of our people strategy and management succession plan, we are working to expand our talent pipeline and build a workforce with the skills necessary to thrive in the workplace of the future. Our workforce development efforts are focused on ensuring that we will maintain our leadership position in the industry and continue to provide our customers with innovative flooring solutions. We utilize digital recruiting tools to remove roadblocks typically faced by diverse candidates in applying to positions so that we can obtain a strong diverse candidate pool.
Through regular employee engagement surveys, semi-annual talent reviews, real-time discussions, available employee communication channels and a focus on our Values; we monitor the needs and expectations of our employees and respond to meet these evolving employee needs. We provide employees with ongoing opportunities to grow and develop through many different programs, including professional and leadership development, continuous performance management internal mobility. These programs and activities increased our employee engagement ratings and led to a workforce dedicated to creating value.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
We recognize DE&I as a business imperative. We believe that our business accomplishments are a result of the efforts of our employees around the world and that a diverse employee population will result in a better understanding of our customers’ needs. We respect the attributes that make each individual unique, including those that can be seen and those that are acquired or learned. Our DE&I purpose is to evolve the organization and our culture to reflect the customers and communities we serve, where employees can be their authentic selves and where differences in background, thought and experience are welcomed, valued and celebrated. We demonstrate purposeful actions and incorporate intentional practices to drive these inclusive behaviors in our daily work. One key example is through changes to our recruiting program, where we have digitally enabled our process to broaden the applicant pool to diverse groups that have traditionally had difficulty accessing job opportunities. This has increased the diversity of our candidate pool and our hires.
We are committed to continually reviewing our operational practices and aligning DE&I initiatives with business objectives. Our DE&I commitment is demonstrated by the establishment of our DE&I Council which considers all parts of our employee experience to ensure that DE&I principles are incorporated into our talent acquisition strategies, development offerings and employee services. The Council is comprised of, and led by, our employees, with executive sponsorship up to and including our CEO.
Competitive Pay and Employee Benefits
We provide market-competitive compensation and benefits to our employees. Our pay programs are designed to be performance-based so that employees are paid based on performance that they can control. Our benefits programs are reviewed each year to ensure that we are meeting current practices in providing benefits that meet the health and safety needs of our employees. When special circumstances occur, such as the recent pandemic, we adjust our benefits to meet our employees’ needs.
Regulatory Matters
Our manufacturing and research facilities are affected by various federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of materials and the protection of the environment. We make expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable environmental requirements at each of our operating facilities. These regulatory requirements continually change, therefore we cannot predict with certainty future expenditures associated with compliance with environmental requirements.
We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of conducting business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, distributors and competitors, employees and other matters. For example, we are currently a party to various litigation matters that involve product liability, tort liability and other claims under a wide range of allegations, including illness due to exposure to certain chemicals used in the workplace, or medical conditions arising from exposure to product ingredients or the presence of trace contaminants. In some cases, these allegations involve multiple defendants and relate to legacy products that we and other defendants purportedly manufactured or sold. We believe these claims and allegations to be without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. For these matters, we also may have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies. 
While complete assurance cannot be given to the outcome of these proceedings, we do not believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
We have not experienced a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures or competitive position as a result of environmental control, legislation and regulations. In addition, there were no material liabilities recorded at December 31, 2021 for potential environmental liabilities on a global basis that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the probable liability could be made. See Note 11, Litigation and Related Matters, in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements" and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for additional information.
