In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
 Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.
 Our consolidated financial statements are stated in United States dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
 In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to common shares refer to the common shares in our capital stock.
 As used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms we, us and our mean AFC Building Technologies Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada, and our former wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario. 
 Historical Overview
We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on May 10, 2011 under the name Auto Tool Technologies Inc. and have been engaged in the distribution of hand tools throughout Canada. Our fiscal year end is December 31. We had one subsidiary, DSL Products Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, which we acquired via a share exchange on December 30, 2011 in exchange for 240,000,000 pre-split shares of our common stock, and which operates our hand tool distribution business. Our business offices are currently located at 101 ½ Mary Street West, Whitby, Ontario, Canada, L1N 2R4. The address of agent for service in Nevada and registered corporate office is c/o National Registered Agents, Inc. of Nevada, 100 East William Street, Suite 204, Carson City, NV, 89701. Our telephone number is (905) 430-6433. 
 On December 19, 2013, our board of directors and a majority holder of our companys voting securities approved a change of name of our company to AFC Building Technologies Inc.
 In addition to the change of name, our board of directors and a majority holder of our company's voting securities approved a 1 old for 8 new forward split of our then issued and outstanding shares of common stock, pursuant to which our issued and outstanding shares increased from 4,345,001 shares of common stock to 34,760,008 shares of common stock, our authorized capital remains unchanged. All references to common stock have been retroactively re-stated.
 A Certificate of Amendment to effect the change of name was filed and became effective with the Nevada Secretary of State on January 10, 2014.
 These amendments were reviewed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and approved for filing with an effective date of January 14, 2014. The forward split and name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on January 14, 2014. Our trading symbol is AFCT. Our CUSIP number is 00108E 100.
 Prior to June 30, 2015, through our former wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited, we imported and marketed hand tools, automotive accessories, lawn and garden products, home products, accessories and attachments for power tools, plumbing products, consumer mechanics tools, cargo control systems and accessories and fasteners. These products were sold to professional end users, distributors, and consumers, and are primarily distributed through retailers (including auto parts stores, home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and retail lumber yards). Our products were sold throughout Canada, and we contracted the services of a national manufacturers agency to call on current and prospective customers. We also sold our products on a wholesale basis via our website at www.toolcachecanada.com, which had on-line ordering capability which is secure and individualized to the respective customer.

Our Current Business
On June 30, 2015, we decided that continuing the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited (DSL) would no longer be economically feasible. All of the shares of DSL held by us were returned to DSL for cancellation and as of June 30, 2015 we no longer held any interest in DSL. Concurrently with the discontinuation of the DSL operations, we entered into a license agreement to obtain an exclusive, 40 year, worldwide license to use and commercialize 15 domain names related to the automotive e-commerce business. In consideration for the granting of the license, we will pay to the licensor a royalty of 2.5% of gross sales for any revenue derived from the use of the licensed domains. Consistent with our historical operations in this area, we intend to continue to pursue automotive e-commerce opportunities.
 Our recent business plan has been to launch a retail consumer portal for the sale of auto parts and accessories. However, we are currently reviewing our business strategy with respect to launching a business to consumer website. Major competitors including eBay and Amazon have recently launched major initiatives to sell auto parts and accessories on-line. We are continuing to monitor these developments. In addition, we are also currently reviewing other potential business ventures, in an effort to capitalize on our logistics and distribution expertise. We have not been able to raise, sufficient capital to launch our e-commerce business, particularly given these developments in the industry.
 Other than as set out in this annual report, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business. 
 Competition
 We will encounter active competition in all of our businesses from both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses via e-commerce. We have a large number of competitors; however, aside from a small number of who market a range of products somewhat comparable to us, the majority of our competitors compete only with respect to one or more individual products or product lines in that segment. Certain large customers offer private label brands (house brands) that compete across a wider spectrum of our DIY segment product offerings.
Customers 
 We do not have any current customers. Until the discontinuation of our former subsidiary, DSL Products Limited, a significant portion of our products were sold to a wide variety of automotive parts stores and home centers in Canada. A consolidation of retailers both in Canada and abroad has occurred over time. While this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers has provided us with opportunities for growth, the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential sales volume loss.
Suppliers 
 We do not have any current suppliers. We formerly acquired our product for resale from established manufacturers and hand tool distributors. Almost all of our products were acquired as finished goods that were immediately ready for sale to our customers.

Intellectual Property
 On June 30, 2015, we acquired an exclusive worldwide license for 40 years to use 15 domain names related to the automotive e-commerce business. In consideration for the granting of the license, we will pay to the licensor a royalty of 2.5% of gross sales for any revenue derived from the use of the licensed domains. 
 With the exception of the above mentioned domain names, we do not own any intellectual property.
 Employees 
 We have no employees. Our sole director and officer, Cindy Kelly, provides management and administration services to our Company as a consultant on an as-needed basis. 
Distribution Methods 
 We do not currently maintain any distribution infrastructure. If we resume product distribution, we intend to engage the services of a thirdparty logistics provider to warehouse and distribute products.
Government Regulation 
 There are no governmental regulations that are material to our operations.
 Research and Development
We have not incurred any research or development expense over the last two fiscal years.
