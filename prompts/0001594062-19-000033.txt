ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
Willow Creek Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the state of Delaware on January 16, 2007, as an exploration company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties.
 
On August 28, 2007, we acquired a 100% undivided interest in a mineral claim known as the Lori/Mamquam Property (the "Lori/Mamquam Property") from Andrew Sostad pursuant to a purchase agreement for cash consideration of $6,000. The Lori/Mamquam Property claim is situated in the Vancouver Mining District, British Columbia, Canada.
 
On October 9, 2010, the Company entered into a Minerals Lease and Agreement (the "Dolly Varden Agreement") with MinQuest, Inc., a Nevada S Corporation ("MinQuest"). Pursuant to the Dolly Varden Agreement, the Company has the right to conduct mineral exploration activities on and in unpatented mining claims collectively known as Dolly Varden South (the "Dolly Varden Property"), situated in Elko County, Nevada for a term of twenty (20) years (the "Term"), with the right to renew. As consideration, the Company paid ten thousand dollars ($10,000) upon execution of the Dolly Varden Agreement, and shall pay ten thousand dollars ($10,000) annually for the remainder of the Term, and any extensions. Additionally, pursuant to the Dolly Varden Agreement, the Company shall be granted the subsequent right to participate in the development of minerals from the Dolly Varden Property subject to the terms and conditions of the Dolly Varden Agreement.
 
On November 17, 2010, the Company entered into a Minerals Lease and Agreement (the "Hercules Agreement") with MinQuest,whereby the Company acquired the right to conduct mineral exploration activities for a term of seven (7) years (the "Term") on various unpatented mining claims situated in Lyon County, Nevada collectively known as the Hercules Property (the "Hercules Property").As consideration for the leased mineral rights the Company shall pay an aggregate of $290,000 and provide $3,500,000 in work commitments over the Term. Additionally, MinQuest is entitled to receive a 3% royalty from all mineral production derived from the exploration and development of the Hercules Property.
 
On February 7, 2011, the Company entered into a Minerals Lease and Agreement (the "Gilman Agreement") with MinQuest, giving the Company the right to conduct mineral exploration activities on and in unpatented mining claims collectively known as the Gilman Gold Property (the "Gilman Property"), situated in Lander County, Nevada for a term of twenty (20) years (the "Term") with the right to renew. As consideration, the Company shall pay ten thousand ($10,000) (the "Base Rent") upon execution of the Gilman Agreement, and an annual payment of the Base Rent plus any applicable annual rent increases in accordance with all of the other terms and conditions of the Gilman Agreement, for the remainder of the Term.
 
On April 20, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended Minerals Lease and Agreement (the "Amended Hercules Agreement") with MinQuest to amend certain terms and conditions of the Hercules Agreement entered into on November 17, 2010 by and between the Company and Minquest, relating to the Hercules Property. Pursuant to the Amended Hercules Agreement, the following material provisions of the Hercules Agreement were amended: i) the Term was extended from seven (7) years to twenty (20) years; ii) the payment schedule as set forth in paragraph 3(a) was amended to include increases for inflation each year after the Seventh Year Anniversary; iii) the Area of Interest as set forth in paragraph 5 was increased to include a one mile radius surrounding the current boundaries of the Hercules Property; and iv) the list of Hercules Property mining claims as set forth in Schedule A thereto was amended to include an aggregate of 88 claims.
 
On April 20, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing that it has acquired an additional two (2) mining claims as part of its Hercules Property located in Lyon County, Nevada. 
 
During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2012 a total of $243,202 was impaired due to lack of ongoing exploration work and financing in determining a proven reserve.

Plan of Operation
 
Our plan of operation during fiscal 2012 remained unchanged and was to conduct mineral exploration activities on the Lori/Mamquam Property, Dolly Varden Property, Gilman Gold Property, and Hercules Property in order to assess whether they possess commercially exploitable mineral deposits. We are presently in the exploration stage of our business and we can provide no assurance that commercially viable mineral deposits exist on our mineral claims or that we will discover commercially exploitable levels of mineral resources on our properties, or if such deposits are discovered, that we will enter into further substantial exploration programs. Further exploration is required before a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility is required to determine whether our mineral claims possess commercially exploitable mineral deposits. We have not, nor has any predecessor, identified any commercially exploitable reserves of these minerals on our mineral claims.
 
We have completed Phase I of our exploration program of the Lori/Mamquam Property, Hercules Property and Dolly Varden Property and are now currently assessing the feasibility of moving into Phase II of our exploration programs. A decision regarding proceeding into Phase II of our explorations on the Lori/Mamquam Property, Hercules Property and Dolly Varden Property will be made by assessing whether the results of Phase I are sufficiently positive to enable us to obtain the financing that we will need to continue through additional stages of the exploration programs. This assessment will include an assessment of the market for financing of mineral exploration projects and an evaluation of our cash reserves after the completion of Phase I. The decision whether or not to proceed will be based on the recommendations of our geological consultant. The decision of the consultant whether or not to recommend proceeding with our exploration programs will be based on a number of factors, including his subjective judgment, and will depend primarily on the results of the immediately preceding stage. As of the date of filing this annual report, we have not yet commenced mineral exploration activities on the Gilman Gold Property. A summary of our first phase exploration activities on the Dolly Varden Property and Hercules Property is outlined below.
 
We announced on November 22, 2010, that Phase One of the exploration program at the Dolly Varden Property began and finished ahead of schedule and below budget. Sixteen (16) samples from this zone were collected and submitted to Chemex labs for assaying and analytical testing. The Company announced on January 4, 2011, that the results from the initial sampling and property examination on the Dolly Varden Property were completed. The geologists reported anomalous gold and copper throughout the property. Sixteen (16) samples were collected and assayed for a suite of elements. Nine (9) of the samples contained significant quantities of copper, silver and/or gold with some also having molybdenum, lead and zinc. Eight (8) of the sixteen (16) rock samples contained gold values that were anomalous to very anomalous (from 0.028 ppm to 1.51 ppm). Four (4) of the samples contained significant quantities of copper and one sample contained significant silver, lead, and zinc.
 
On August 25, 2011, the Company announced the completion of Phase One of its drill program at its Hercules Property. Phase One was comprised of a 20-hole drill program that totaled more than 6,000 feet of drilling of targeted areas on the Hercules Property. The Company had originally only planned to drill 12-14 holes but due to some encouraging initial drill cores, the Company decided to increase that number to 20.
 
We intend to rely heavily on outside consultants to provide all equipment and field work needed for the exploratory program we intend to conduct.
 
We do not have sufficient cash on hand to fund our operations for the next twelve months. We also require additional financing in order to commence the exploration of the Dolly Varden Property, Gilman Gold Property, and Hercules Property.  As a result of the delay in our exploration plans due to lack of capital, we wrote down the capitalized value of our mineral properties during fiscal 2012.
 
Insurance
 
We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party to a liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
Competition
 
We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for us to develop our mineral properties.

Research and Development Expenditures
 
We have not incurred any research expenditures since our incorporation.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark.
 
Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees
 
During fiscal 2012, Terry Fields, our chief executive officer and director devoted approximately 15-20 hours a week of his time to our operations. We currently have no other employees, other than Mr. Fields. We also frequently use third party consultants to assist in the completion of various projects. Third parties are instrumental to keep the development of projects on time and on budget.
Government Regulation
 
If we decide to continue with the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties, we will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals. All mineral exploration activities carried out on a mineral claim or mining lease must be done in compliance within the jurisdiction's Bureau of Mines. This applies to all mines during exploration, development, construction, production, closure, reclamation and abandonment. It outlines the powers of the Chief Inspector of Mines to inspect mines, the procedures for obtaining permits to commence work in, on or about a mine and other procedures to be observed at a mine.
 
Additionally, the provisions of the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for mines contain standards for employment, occupational health and safety, accident investigation, work place conditions, protective equipment, training programs, and site supervision. Also, the Mineral Exploration Code contains standards for exploration activities including construction and maintenance, site preparation, drilling, trenching and work in and about a water body.
 
Additional approvals and authorizations may be required from other government agencies, depending upon the nature and scope of the proposed exploration program. If the exploration activities require the falling of timber, then either a free use permit or a license to cut must be issued by the state. Items such as waste approvals may be required from the State if the proposed exploration activities are significantly large enough to warrant them. Waste approvals refer to the disposal of rock materials removed from the earth which must be reclaimed. An environmental impact statement may be required.
 
We will also have to sustain the cost of reclamation and environmental remediation for all exploration work undertaken. Both reclamation and environmental remediation refer to putting disturbed ground back as close to its original state as possible. Other potential pollution or damage must be cleaned-up and renewed along standard guidelines outlined in the usual permits. Reclamation is the process of bringing the land back to its natural state after completion of exploration activities. Environmental remediation refers to the physical activity of taking steps to remediate, or remedy, any environmental damage caused. The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the extent of the exploration program that will be undertaken beyond completion of the recommended work program. Because there is presently no information on the size, tenor, or quality of any resource or reserve at this time, it is impossible to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on earnings, our competitive position or on us in the event a potentially economic deposit is discovered.
 
If we anticipate disturbing ground during our mineral exploration activities, we may be required to make an application to the State for a permit. We do not anticipate any difficulties in obtaining a permit, if needed. Initial exploration activities (grid establishment, geological mapping, soil sampling, geophysical surveys) do not involve ground disturbance and as a result do not, at this time, require a work permit. Any follow-up trenching and/or drilling will require permits, applications for which will be submitted well in advance of the planned work.

If we enter the production phase, of which there is no assurance, the cost of complying with permit and regulatory environment laws will be greater because the impact on the project area is greater. Permits and regulations will control all aspects of the production program if the project continues to that stage. The regulatory requirements that we will have to meet will likely include:
 
 
i. | Ensuring that any water discharge meets drinking water standards;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | Dust generation will have to be minimal or otherwise remediated;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | Dumping of material on the surface will have to be re-contoured and re-vegetated with natural vegetation;
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iv.   All material to be left on the surface will need to be environmentally benign;
 Ground water will have to be monitored for any potential contaminants;
 vi.   The socio-economic impact of the project will have to be evaluated and if deemed negative, will have to be re-mediated; and
 vii.  There will have to be an impact report of the work on the local fauna and flora including a study of potentially endangered species.
