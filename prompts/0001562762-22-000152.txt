Item 1. Business
General Information

Mobivity Holdings Corp. (the “Company” or “we”) is in the business of developing and operating proprietary platforms over which brands and enterprises can conduct national and localized, data-driven marketing campaigns. 

Mobivity’s Recurrency platform enables multi-unit retailers to leverage the power of their own data to yield maximum customer spend, frequency and loyalty while achieving the highest Return on Marketing Spend (ROMS) possible. Mobivity’s customers use Recurrency to:

Transform messy point-of-sale (POS) data collected from thousands of points of sale into usable intelligence.
Measure, predict, and boost guest frequency and spend by channel.
Deploy and manage one-time use offer codes and attribute sales accurately across every channel, promotion and media program.
Deliver 1:1 promotions and offers with customized Mobile Messaging, Personalized Receipt Promotions and Integrated Loyalty programs.

Mobivity’s Recurrency, delivered as a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) platform, is used by leading brands including Subway, Sonic Drive-In, Chick-fil-A, Checkers/Rally’s and Circle K’s across more than 40,000 retail locations globally.

We’re living in a data-driven economy. In fact, by 2003 — when the concept of “big data” became common vernacular in marketing - as much data was being created every two days as had been created in all of time prior to 2003. Today, Big Data has grown at such a rate that 90% of the world’s data has been created in the past two years. Unfortunately, despite there being so much data accumulated, only one percent of data is being utilized today by most businesses.

The challenge for multi-unit retailers isn’t that they don’t have enough data; in fact, national retailers are collecting millions of detailed transactions daily from thousands of points of sale around the world. The challenge is being able to make sense of this transaction data, which is riddled with data entry errors, collected by multiple POS systems and complicated by a taxonomy compiled by thousands of different franchisee owners. To normalize such an overwhelming amount of data into usable intelligence and then leverage it to optimize media investment and promotion strategy requires numerous teams of data analysts and data scientists that many retailers and restaurant operators simply don’t have. Which is why so many technology and data companies, that can help solve these challenges, have been invested in and acquired by brands including, McDonald’s, Starbucks and Yum Brands.

Mobivity’s Recurrency platform fills this need with a self-service SaaS offering, enabling operators to intelligently optimize their promotions, media and marketing spend. Recurrency drives system-wide sales producing on average a 13% increase in guest spend and a 26% improvement in frequency, ultimately delivering an average Return on Marketing Spend of 10X. In other words, for every dollar invested in marketing, retailers using Recurrency to manage, optimize and deliver multi-channel consumer promotions generate an average of ten dollars in incremental revenue from their customers.

The Recurrency Platform
Mobivity's Recurrency™ platform unlocks valuable POS and mobile data to help transform customer transactions into actionable and attributable marketing insights. Our technology provides transactional data, in real-time, that uncovers market-basket information and attributes both online and traditional promotions. Recurrency is comprised of seven components. 
POS Data Capture 
Recurrency captures, normalizes, integrates, and stores transaction data and is compatible with most POS systems used by restaurants and retailers today. The result is a clean useful dataset upon which to predict and influence customers’ buying behavior and deliver basket-level insights.
Analytics Powered by Machine Learning
Recurrency uses Machine Learning (“ML”) to uncover patterns in the buying behaviors of consumers and leverages that data to suggest pricing optimizations, and guide marketing campaigns.
Offers and Promotions
Recurrency provides a digital wallet system for creating and managing dynamic offers and promotions, enabling accurate and complete closed-loop attribution across all channels, media and marketing efforts. Retailers can deploy one-time, limited-use and multi-use promotions across all online and offline marketing channels that are scannable at the POS or redeemable online, enabling fraud-free, controllable promotion delivery and attribution at scale. Marketing teams can use the comprehensive attribution analysis and insights to optimize media mix and spend for maximum Return on Marketing Spend (“ROMS”).
Predictive Offers
Recurrency leverages the normalized data captured at the POS and applies Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) to build profiles of both known and anonymous customers, analyzes pre and post-redemption behavior and then predicts offers that will drive the highest increases in customer spend and frequency at the lowest discount possible. The result is optimized, personalized promotions that produce the highest ROMS possible.
Personalized Receipt Promotions
Recurrency unlocks the power of transactional data to create relevant and timely customer messages printed on the receipts already being generated at the POS. Both clients and agencies are using Recurrency to drive better results and make decisions around offers, promotions, and customer engagement through the medium of the printed receipt. Software integrated with leading POS systems, such as Oracle, MICROS, or installed directly onto receipt printer platforms, such as Epson’s OmniLink product, dynamically controls what is printed on receipts including images, coupons, announcements, or other calls-to-action, such as invitations to participate in a survey. Recurrency offers a Web-based interface where users can design receipt content and implement business rules to dictate what receipt content is printed in particular situations. All receipt content is also transmitted to cloud-based Recurrency for storage and analysis. 
Customized Mobile Messaging 
Recurrency transforms standard short message service (“SMS”), multimedia messaging service (“MMS”), and rich communication services (“RCS”) into a data-driven marketing medium. Recurrency tracks and measures offer effectiveness at a more granular level than other solutions, allowing clients to create smarter offers and drive higher redemption rates. Our proprietary platform connects to all wireless carriers so that any consumer, on any wireless service (for example, Verizon), can join our customer’s SMS/MMS mobile marketing campaign. Our customers use Recurrency’s self-service interface to build, segment, target and optimize mobile messaging campaigns to drive increased guest frequency and spend. Recurrency is an industry leader in RCS messaging and has an industry leading broadcast reach.
Belly Loyalty
Mobivity’s Belly Loyalty solution drives increased customer engagement and frequency with a customer-facing digital rewards platform via an app and digital pad. Using Belly, customers can customize rewards and leverage pre-built email campaigns and triggers to encourage greater frequency as well as identify and reactivate lapsed customers.

Company Strategy

Our objective is to build an industry-leading Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) product that connects consumers to merchants and brands. The key elements to our strategy are:

Exploit the competitive advantages and operating leverage of our technology platform. The core of our business is our proprietary POS Data Capture technology. Several years of development went into designing POS Data Capture such that the process of intercepting POS data and performing actions, such as controlling the receipt printer with receipt is scalable, portable to a wide variety of POS platforms, and does not impact performance factors including the print speed of a typical receipt printer. Furthermore, we believe the transmission of POS data to Mobivity’s cloud-based data stores presents a very competitive and innovative method of enabling POS data access. Additionally, we believe that our Recurrency platform is more advanced than technologies offered by our competitors and provides us with a significant competitive advantage. With more than ten years of development, we believe that our platform operates SMS/MMS text messaging transactions at a “least cost” relative to competitors while also being capable of supporting SMS/MMS text messaging transactional volume necessary to support our goal of several thousand end users. Leveraging our Recurrency platform allows for full attribution of SMS/MMS offers, which we believe is a unique combination of both SMS/MMS text messaging and POS data.
Evolve our sales and customer support infrastructure to uniquely serve very large customer implementations such as franchise-based brands who operate a large number of locations. Over the past few years, we have focused our efforts on the development of our technology and solutions with the goal of selling and supporting small and medium-sized businesses. Going forward, we intend to increase significantly our investments in sales and customer support resources tailored to selling to customers that operate franchise brands. Today we support more than 30,000 merchant locations globally.
Acquire complementary businesses and technologies. We will continue to search and identify unique opportunities which we believe will enhance our product features and functionality, revenue goals, and technology. We intend to target companies with some or all of the following characteristics: (1) an established revenue base; (2) strong pipeline and growth prospects; (3) break-even or positive cash flow; (4) opportunities for substantial expense reductions through integration into our platform; (5) strong sales teams; and (6) technology and services that further build out and differentiate our platform. Our acquisitions have historically been consummated through the issuance of a combination of our common stock and cash.
Build our intellectual property portfolio. We currently have nine issued patents that we believe have significant potential application in the technology industry. We plan to continue our investment in building a strong intellectual property portfolio.

While these are the key elements of our current strategy, there can be no guarantees that our strategy will not change or that our strategy will be successful.

Industry Background

Traditionally only sophisticated e-commerce brands, such as Amazon, were capable of personalizing and targeting their marketing to consumers as they navigated online shopping experiences that tracked their every move, all the way to check out. But despite the scale and success of e-commerce, it still accounts for just around 10% of commerce conducted in the U.S. The other 90% of “offline” merchants struggle to leverage data to combine with digital marketing channels and replicate the same personalized marketing tactics employed by successful e-commerce operators. Particularly, merchants are challenged with connecting purchase data collected by traditional point-of-sale terminals and mapping those transactions back to consumers to ensure that follow on marketing messages are personalized to the consumers purchase history. 

Offline marketers will increasingly invest in technologies that leverage data to power personalized, digital consumer experiences and mimic how e-commerce marketers operate. This is a trend that has growing support from various industry analysts as well. McKinsey recently reported that “data activated marketing” can boost sales 15%-20% and significantly improve the ROI on marketing spend across marketing channels. While the upside of data driven marketing may seem obvious, marketers are also converging their digital and offline worldviews when it comes to thinking about how they allocate their marketing budgets. Gartner’s 2015–2016 Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Spend Survey reported that 98 percent of CMOs no longer make a clear distinction between marketing online and offline and say the disciplines are merging. We believe that these trends reveal a material insight into how the market is converging towards our value proposition and will further propel our growth; as the market increasingly convinces itself of the upside of targeting its marketing based off of consumer data, as suggested by the McKinsey study, and the Gartner study suggests that offline and digital marketing disciplines are merging, then our unique approach to merging offline point-of-sale data with digital channels.

Data driven marketing will also leverage the rapidly emerging field of “cognitive computing,” where computers are becoming intelligent – often referred to as “artificial intelligence”. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, has described how Google is shifting from a mobile first world, to an AI first world; and actions speak louder than words - Google has acquired more artificial intelligence startups than Facebook and Microsoft combined. A recent forecast by Tractica (a market intelligence firm that focuses on human interaction with technology) suggests that annual worldwide AI revenue will grow at a combined annual growth rate of more than 49% to $36.8 billion by 2025. One of the key drivers to progress in this field is called “machine learning,” which aims to give computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. This could open up entirely new possibilities where marketing becomes not just automated, but autonomous and entirely free of human intervention. Machine learning is powered by collecting massive amounts of data that can “train” machines to think on their own; an article in Fortune last year went as far as calling “data the new oil”. Jim Hare, research vice president at Gartner, proclaimed "As AI accelerates up the Hype Cycle, many software providers are looking to stake their claim in the biggest gold rush in recent years.”

The Mobivity Solution

Our Recurrency platform is designed to leverage point-of-sale data, along with cognitive computing, to increase visits, spend, and loyalty from consumers. We do this by capturing transaction detail, analyzing the data, and motivating customers and employees to take actions that improve business performance. 

Capture: Recall that more than 90% of our economy still functions “offline”. Our Recurrency solution plays an integral part in bringing brick and mortar businesses into the digital future by creating an extensible point of access to their POS data. Recapture is a lightweight software client that can be installed in just about any POS system and immediately enables applications to operate off of real-time POS data. 
Analyze. Often times marketers spend a large portion of their budget on marketing programs with little to no visibility into attributable sales. A 2016 IAB/Winterberry study reported cross-channel measurement and attribution would be the No. 1 tactic occupying respondents’ time last year, a whopping 63 percent year-over-year increase from the previous year. This is because understanding consumers’ offline behavior is mission-critical for brands and agencies looking to bridge the gap between the online and offline worlds. Our Recurrency solution allows for easy access to POS data enabling full attribution of our campaigns, along with potentially linking offline POS data to other forms of digital marketing such as social or search advertising. 
Motivating Consumers. We motivate consumers and employees to improve business performance through our Recurrency solution. This is where our ability to engage consumers through their mobile phone and track their behavior to any of these offline cash registers, combines with machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to dial-in targeted marketing engagements that cause consumers to spend more. Recurrency has engaged more than nine million consumers across more than 30,000 retail locations while examining billions of purchase transactions. In one study, we worked with the analytics and data team of one of our largest clients where we studied the behavior of consumers both before and after their enrollment in an SMS marketing program. Together, we took a universe of hundreds of thousands of consumers and examined their purchases for a period of time before they joined. We then tracked their purchases after they joined the program and learned that these consumers increased their overall spend by forty five percent. Restaurants fight tooth and nail for every 1% increase in spend, so this was an amazing result. Another brand challenged us to increase their customer frequency which had historically been an average of just one visit every 60 days. By leveraging our Recurrency platform, we were able to create a targeted offer program that printed coupons on consumers’ receipts. In some cases, consumers returned in eight days – far better than the historical average of 60 days. Within 90 days since launching the program, consumers were returning within days (instead of months) and the program is on pace to generate an ROI of more than 400%.

In the future, we intend to develop additional platform features with the goal of driving additional value by helping brick and mortar brands leverage POS data to drive business growth.

Marketing and Sales

We market and sell the services offered over our proprietary platform directly through our own sales force, via resellers, and in some cases through agents.

Direct Sales. Our direct sales force is predominantly comprised of a team of representatives employed by us to promote and sell our services both domestically and internationally.
Resellers. We sell our services via wholesale pricing of licensing and transactional fees to various resellers who market and sell the Mobivity services under their own brand.
Agents. We also engage independent agents to market and sell our services under the Mobivity brand in return for payment of a commission or revenue share for customers they introduce to us.
In addition to our direct and indirect sales channels, we also market our services online through our Website, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other online channels. We also participate in various trade and industry events to build awareness and promote exposure to our services and brand.

Our services are predominantly marketed and sold in the form of a recurring software licensing fee that is determined by desired features and the number of physical locations our customers would like to deploy the services in. For example, a customer who exclusively utilizes our SMS/MMS feature for one location will pay a much lower recurring licensing fee than a marketer who desires our full breadth of product features and needs to drive localized marketing campaigns across 500 locations in various cities or locales.

In addition to license fees, we also arrange for a transaction fee in special cases where our customers require greater bandwidth or throughput to process large volumes of mobile messaging transactions. For example, a customer may want to utilize our services for a major sporting event when there may be tens of thousands of fans who are expecting a “score alert” sent to their mobile phone via a SMS/MMS text message. In this case, the required resources to facilitate a large number of SMS/MMS messages in a short period of time is much higher and therefore we may charge an additional per-SMS/MMS text message fee to our customer.

Research and Development

We have developed an internal and external software development team with many years of experience in the mobile advertising and marketing industries. Our research and development activities are focused on enhancements to our platform, including extending our technology into payment processing, location-based services, application analytics, and other technical opportunities in the evolving mobile industry.

Our total engineering, research and development expenditures in 2021 and 2020 were $3,583,773 and $3,535,742, respectively.

Competition

Combining POS data, cognitive computing, and various marketing applications is relatively new. The majority of our competitors are start-ups or early stage growth companies helping to pioneer the technology necessary to extract POS data and integrate that data with technology channels such as mobile messaging, e-mail, social media, and others. Competitors in this arena include Punchh, Personica, Bridg, Sparkfly, Paytronix and PosIQ. 

We also believe that POS manufacturers could also pose a competitive threat by vertically integrating similar features and capabilities into their core products. Leading vendors in the POS space include Oracle/Micros, NCR, IBM, Square, First Data/Clover, and others.

We believe that the key competitive factors that differentiate us from our competitors include:

Intellectual Property. We currently own nine patents that cover various approaches to facilitating SMS/MMS text messaging solutions and manipulating receipt content.
Competitive pricing. We are unaware of any solution in the market that offers the ability to aggregate and analyze POS data, activate mobile messaging campaigns, convert print receipts into targeted marketing transactions, and shape employee performance in real-time all from a single platform (Recurrency). Our platform approach will allow for bundled pricing strategies, or a la carte tactics, that could create unfair pricing advantages.
Scalability. We believe that our platform is more scalable than most if not all of our competitors. We have scaled from around 1,000 POS integrations to more than 20,000 in just three years. Aside from the POS manufacturers themselves, we are unaware of any other solutions provider who is currently integrated with as many POS devices as we are.

Seasonality

Our business, as is typical of companies in our industry, is highly seasonal. This is primarily due to traditional marketing and advertising spending being heaviest during the holiday season while brands, advertising agencies, mobile operators and media companies often close out annual budgets towards the end of the calendar year. Seasonal trends have historically contributed to, and we anticipate, will continue to contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.
Intellectual Property- 

We regard the protection of our developed technologies and intellectual property rights as an important element of our business operations and crucial to our success. We rely primarily on a combination of patent laws, trademark laws, copyright laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except under specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements provide that all of the technology which is conceived by the individual during the course of employment is our exclusive property. The development of our technology and many of our processes are dependent upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel.

As of the date of this report we own eight patents. U.S. Patent numbers 7,991,388 B1 and 8,244,216 B1 were issued on August 2, 2011 and August 14, 2012, respectively. These patents cover a geo-bio-metric personal identification number, a service that authenticates a 
user from a feature phone or smart phone using a number of mobile attainable attributes: geolocation, facial image, accelerometer (which measures the physical orientation or movement of the device itself), and text messaging. The purpose of the geo-bio-metric PIN service is to authenticate a user while verifying the following: the user is currently using his or her other phone; the user is at the location that their phone is at; the user is not at another location and using their phone through a proxy; and an impostor is not using the phone.

In March 2011, we acquired US Patent number 6,788,769 B1 which covers a method and system for using telephone numbers as a key to address email and online content without the use of a look-up database. Using this system, a phone number is used to access a website or an email address in exactly the same way it is used to dial a telephone. The patent expires in March of 2021.

--


U.S. Patent numbers 8,463,306 and 8,818,434 were issued on June 11, 2013 and August 26, 2014, respectively. U.S. Patent 9,307,430 was issued on April 5, 2016. These patents cover a method and system for testing a SMS/MMS text messaging network. The method and system allows for real-time testing of the initiation and completion of SMS/MMS text messages and any delivery delays across the major American mobile phone carriers, and accurately measures the progress on SMS/MMS broadcasts and records when a broadcast has been completed.

U.S Patent number 9,495,671 was granted on November 15, 2016. U.S. Patent 9,727,853 was issued on August 8, 2017. These patents cover a system to generate value added messages on receipts printed by point-of-sale (POS) systems based on various rules determined by information conveyed on the purchase receipt such as location, time of day, or other purchase data. The patent application claims priority to a patent application filed in 2006.

U.S. Patent number 10,475,017 B2 was granted on November 12, 2019. This patent covers a point-of-sale terminal and a computer-readable storage medium that generates transaction information for a commercial transaction, the transaction information including customer information and purchase information. The point-of-sale terminal may generate nutritional information based on the purchase information. The point-of-sale terminal may send the customer information, the purchase information, and location information identifying a location of the POS terminal to an advertising server and may receive responsive advertising content from the advertising server. The point-of-sale terminal may print a receipt including the transaction information, the nutritional information, and the advertising content.

Our issued and any future patents that we may issue may not survive a legal challenge to their scope, validity or enforceability, or provide significant protection for us. The failure of our patents, or the failure of our copyright and trade secret laws to adequately protect our technology, might make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products or technologies. In addition, patents may not issue from any of our current or any future applications.

As of the date of this report we own trademarks for Boomtext, SmartReceipt, Livelenz, and several trademarks from the Belly acquisition. 

Government Regulation

The growth and development of the mobile messaging market and the market for electronic storage of personal information has resulted in a variety of stringent consumer protection laws, many of which impose significant burdens on companies that store personal information. Depending on the products and services that they offer, mobile data service providers may be subject to regulations and laws applicable to providers of mobile, Internet and VOIP services, including domestic and international laws and regulations relating to user privacy and data protection, defamation, pricing, advertising, taxation, gambling, sweepstakes, promotions, billing, real estate, consumer protection, accessibility, content regulation, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile, television and intellectual property ownership and infringement. We expect that the regulation of our industry generally will continue to increase and that we will be required to devote increasing amounts of legal and other resources to address this regulation. In addition, the application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection, marketing, advertising, consumer protection and mobile disclosures in many instances is unclear or unsettled.

In addition to its regulation of wireless telecommunications providers generally, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has examined, or is currently examining, how and when consumers enroll in mobile services, what types of disclosures consumers receive, what services consumers are purchasing and how much consumers are charged. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has been asked to regulate how mobile marketers can use consumers' personal information. Consumer advocates claim that many consumers do not know when their information is being collected from cell phones and how such information is retained, used and shared with other companies. Consumer groups have asked the FTC to identify practices that may compromise privacy and consumer welfare; examine opt-in procedures to ensure consumers are aware of what data is at issue and how it will be used; investigate marketing tactics that target children; and create policies to halt abusive practices. The FTC has expressed interest, in particular, in the mobile environment and services that collect sensitive data, such as location-based information.

The principal laws and regulations that pertain to us and our customers in connection with their utilization of our platform, include:

Deceptive Trade Practice Law in the U.S. The FTC and state attorneys general are given broad powers by legislatures to curb unfair and deceptive trade practices. These laws and regulations apply to mobile marketing campaigns and behavioral advertising. The general guideline is that all material terms and conditions of the offer must be "clearly and conspicuously" disclosed to the consumer prior to the buying decision. The balancing of the desire to capture a potential customer's attention, while providing adequate disclosure, can be challenging in the mobile context due to the lack of screen space available to provide required disclosures.
Behavioral Advertising. Behavioral advertising is a technique used by online publishers and advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns. Behavioral advertising uses information collected from an individual's web-browsing behavior, such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made, to select which advertisements to display to that individual. This data can be valuable for online marketers looking to personalize advertising initiatives or to provide geo-tags through mobile devices. Many businesses adhere to industry self-governing principles, including an opt-out regime whereby information may be collected until an individual indicates that he or she no longer agrees to have this information collected. The FTC and EU member states are considering regulations in this area, which may include implementation of a more rigorous opt-in regime. An opt-in policy would prohibit businesses from collecting and using information from individuals who have not voluntarily consented. Among other things, the implementation of an opt-in regime could require substantial technical support and negatively impact the market for our mobile advertising products and services. A few states have also introduced bills in recent years that would restrict behavioral advertising within the state. These bills would likely have the practical effect of regulating behavioral advertising nationwide because of the difficulties behind implementing state-specific policies or identifying the location of a particular consumer. There have also been a large number of class action suits filed against companies engaged in behavioral advertising.
Behavioral Advertising-Privacy Regulation. Our business is affected by U.S. federal and state, as well as EU member state and foreign country, laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. In recent years, regulation has focused on the collection, use, disclosure and security of information that may be used to identify or that actually identifies an individual, such as an Internet Protocol address or a name. Although the mobile and Internet advertising privacy practices are currently largely self-regulated in the U.S., the FTC has conducted numerous discussions on this subject and suggested that more rigorous privacy regulation is appropriate, including regulation of non-personally identifiable information which could, with other information, be used to identify an individual. Within the EU, member state data protection authorities typically regard IP addresses as personal information, and legislation adopted recently in the EU requires consent for the placement of a cookie on a user device. In addition, EU data protection authorities are following with interest the FTC's discussions regarding behavioral advertising and may follow suit by imposing additional privacy requirements for mobile advertising practices.
Marketing-Privacy Regulation. In addition, there are U.S. federal and state laws and EU member state and other country laws that govern SMS/MMS and telecommunications-based marketing, generally requiring senders to transmit messages (including those sent to mobile devices) only to recipients who have specifically consented to receiving such messages. U.S. federal, EU member state and other country laws also govern e-mail marketing, generally imposing an opt-out requirement for emails sent within an existing business relationship.
SMS/MMS and Location-Based Marketing Best Practices and Guidelines. We voluntarily comply with the guidelines of the Mobile Marketing Association, or MMA, a global association of 700 agencies, advertisers, mobile device manufacturers, wireless operators and service providers and others interested in the potential of marketing via the mobile channel. The MMA has published a code of conduct and best practices guidelines for use by those involved in mobile messaging activities. The guidelines were developed by a collaboration of the major carriers and they require adherence to them as a condition of service. We voluntarily comply with the MMA code of conduct, which generally require notice and user consent for delivery of location-based services. In addition, the Cellular Telephone Industry Association, or CTIA, has developed Best Practices and Guidelines to promote and protect user privacy regarding location-based services.
TCPA. The United States Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, prohibits unsolicited voice and text calls to cell phones through the use of an automatic telephone-dialing system (“ATDS”) unless the recipient has given prior consent. The statute also prohibits companies from initiating telephone solicitations to individuals on the national Do-Not-Call list, and restricts the hours when such messages may be sent. Violations of the TCPA can result in statutory damages of $500 per violation (i.e., for each individual text message). U.S. state laws impose additional regulations on voice and text calls. We believe that our platform does not employ an ATDS within the meaning of the TCPA based on case law construing that term.
CAN-SPAM. The U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, or CAN SPAM Act, prohibits all commercial e-mail messages, as defined in the law, to mobile phones unless the device owner has given "express prior authorization." Recipients of such messages must also be allowed to opt-out of receiving future messages the same way they opted-in. Senders have ten business days to honor opt-out requests. The FCC has compiled a list of domain names used by wireless service providers to which marketers may not send commercial e-mail messages. Senders have 30 days from the date the domain name is posted on the FCC site to stop sending unauthorized commercial e-mail to addresses containing the domain name. Violators are subject to fines of up to $6.0 million and up to one year in jail for some spamming activities. Carriers, the FTC, the FCC, and State Attorneys General may bring lawsuits to enforce alleged violations of the Act.

Communications Privacy Acts. Foreign and U.S. federal and state laws impose liability for intercepting communications while in transit or accessing the contents of communications while in storage. EU member state laws also require consent for our receiving this information, and if our carrier customers fail to obtain such consent we could be subjected to civil or even criminal penalties.
Security Breach Notification Requirements. EU member state laws require notice to the member state data protection authority of a data security breach involving personal data if the breach poses a risk to individuals. In addition, Germany enacted a broad requirement to notify individuals in the event of a data security breach that is likely to be followed by notification requirements to data subjects in other EU member states. In the U.S., various states have enacted data breach notification laws, which require notification of individuals and sometimes state regulatory bodies in the event of breaches involving certain defined categories of personal information. Japan and Uruguay have also enacted security breach notice requirements. This new trend suggests that breach notice statutes may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including by the U.S. at the federal level, as well.
Children. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act prohibit the knowing collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, and strictly regulate the transmission of requests for personal information to such children. Other countries do not recognize the ability of children to consent to the collection of personal information. In addition, it is likely that behavioral advertising regulations will impose special restrictions on use of information collected from minors for this purpose.
Data Privacy Acts. Individual states and countries have enacted or are moving forward with privacy compliance rules based on industry and types of data collected, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Nevada’s Senate Bill 220 and the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The acts provide residents the right to know what data is being collected about them and have access to it, whether that information is sold and the ability to refuse that data being sold, as well as the ability to opt out of it’s collection. Penalties for non-compliance vary by state and country, for instance the maximum penalty of the CCPA is $7,500 for intentional violations. The largest financial impact of CCPA on a business is the provisioning of the right of consumers to bring forward lawsuits. These situations may arise from instances where their “non-encrypted or non-redacted personal information” is breached, regardless of the harm done to the data. Under the CCPA, consumers can collect between $100 and $750 for each event. If the damages are greater than $750, then the consumer may receive even more.
