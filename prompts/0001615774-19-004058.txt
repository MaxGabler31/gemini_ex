Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
References in this report to “we,” “us” or “our company” refer to MTech Acquisition Corp. References in this report to our “public shares” are to shares of our Class A common stock sold as part of the units sold in our initial public offering (whether they were purchased in such offering or thereafter in the open market) and references to “public stockholders” refer to the holders of our public shares, including our sponsor (as defined below), officers and directors to the extent they purchase public shares, provided that their status as “public stockholders” shall only exist with respect to such public shares. References in this report to our “management” or our “management team” refer to our officers and directors, references to our “sponsor” refer to MTech Sponsor LLC. Our chairman, Steven Van Dyke, and our president and one of our directors, Scott Sozio, are the managing members of one of our sponsor’s managing members and each of our officers and directors is a member of our sponsor or owns, indirectly, membership interests in our sponsor through a managing member entity. 
 
General
 
We are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Our initial business combination and value creation strategy will be to acquire and, after our initial business combination, assist in the growth of a business ancillary to the cannabis industry, with a particular sector focus that includes compliance, business intelligence, brand development and media. However, we are not limited to this industry and, if the Merger (defined below) is not consummated, we may pursue a business combination opportunity in any business or industry we choose and we may pursue a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States.
 
Although the cannabis industry has evolved significantly and continues to mature, we believe the industry is still undercapitalized and companies operating across multiple verticals consistently have trouble accessing capital from traditional resources. Financing of businesses that operate within the legal cannabis industry in the U.S. has relied largely on private money — friends and family, high net-worth individuals and small-to-medium-sized private investment firms. Institutional investors have shied away from companies in the cannabis industry, especially those that are directly involved in the production, distribution and sale of cannabis (businesses that “touch the plant”), which we do not intend to target. Even businesses that do not “touch the plant” and instead provide ancillary services to the industry, for the most part, have found it extremely difficult to access capital. The federal prohibition on cannabis has led to a situation in which small investors and venture funds have become the industry’s financial backbone. As a result, we believe we have the opportunity to create a compelling structure that will enable the right target company to go public and access the capital it needs in order to accelerate its organic growth and also create additional stakeholder value as a well-capitalized acquirer in an industry defined by undercapitalized competition. We will not invest in an entity or assets which violate, or aid and abet the violation, of federal law.
 
On October 10, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among us, MTech Acquisition Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (“Pubco”), MTech Purchaser Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, MTech Company Merger Sub LLC, a Colorado limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, MTech Sponsor LLC, a Florida limited liability company, MJ Freeway LLC, a Colorado limited liability (“MJF”), and Harold Handelsman. 
 
Consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Merger) is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of the Merger by our stockholders in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the completion of a redemption offer whereby we will be providing our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of our common stock for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in our trust account.

For any risks associated with the Merger and MJF, see the Company’s preliminary proxy statement, as amended from time to time (the “Proxy Statement”) containing information about the Merger and MJF, as initially filed with the SEC on November 7, 2018.
 
The Merger Agreement and related agreements are further described in the Form 8-K filed by us on October 11, 2018. For additional information regarding MJF, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, see the Proxy Statement.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume that the closing of the Merger will occur.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our strategy is to invest in businesses that are ancillary to the production, distribution and sale of cannabis, with a particular focus on three segments of the industry:

● | Compliance: We believe the businesses that succeed in these early years of legal cannabis will be the ones that make compliance with state regulations an operational priority, driving decision-making at all levels of the company. We believe that investing in compliance services will be critical to the success of the industry in the long-term. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Business Intelligence: Cannabis is in the very early stages of discovery. Companies need tools to understand and analyze their business, in many cases without the ability to borrow from other industries. We believe cannabis presents a unique set of challenges, as a highly-regulated industry that operates within a network of conflicting federal and state laws. As a result, ancillary businesses that provide services to other industries, and would under normal circumstances make their products and technologies available to the cannabis industry, have instead stayed out of the market. The void is being filled by companies dedicated to the cannabis industry, in many cases designing custom-built technology. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Brands & Media: Cannabis is an industry defined by a lack of information and misinformation. We believe that brands and media will play a critical role in supplying consumers with the knowledge and confidence to patronize the category.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following criteria that we have used in evaluating business transaction opportunities and would continue to use in the event that we are unable to consummate the Merger. We expect that no individual criterion will entirely determine a decision to pursue a particular opportunity. Further, any particular business transaction opportunity which we ultimately determine to pursue may not meet one or more of these criteria. Notwithstanding anything below, we will not invest in an entity or assets which violate, or aid and abet the violation, of federal law. We have used these criteria in evaluating acquisition opportunities, including MJF, which meets all of these criteria, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with an alternative target business that may not meet the following criteria:

● | Ancillary: Does not touch the plant, allowing the business to be unconstrained by state borders.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Able to Build Infrastructure: Our management believes that technology-driven solutions to operational challenges in a nascent industry and complex regulatory environment have a unique window of opportunity to create infrastructure that will grow with the industry.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scalable: We believe the cannabis industry is in an explosive growth phase and our goal is to invest in the businesses that are built to scale faster than the competition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  6

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business transaction may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that the Merger is not consummated and we find an opportunity that is more compelling to us than the opportunities described above, we would pursue such opportunity. However, we have not established any particular parameters as to when we might turn our attention to opportunities that are not underperforming and/or not operating in an industry undergoing a period of dislocation. 
 
Direct Involvement Post-Transaction 
 
Because our management team knows what it is like to operate in the cannabis industry, we understand the everyday challenges confronting other management teams in this industry. Not only do we bring capital and resources to our investments, but we have the ability to anticipate their needs and equip them with solutions. After the initial business combination, our management team intends to apply a rigorous approach to enhancing shareholder value, including evaluating the experience and expertise of incumbent management and making changes when appropriate, examining opportunities for revenue enhancement, cost savings, operating efficiencies and strategic acquisitions and divestitures, and accessing the financial markets to optimize the company’s capital structure. We will pursue post-merger initiatives through participation on the board of directors, through direct involvement with company operations and/or calling upon a stable of former managers and advisors when necessary.

● | Corporate Governance and Oversight. Actively participating as board members can include many activities ranging from monthly or quarterly board meetings, chairing standing (compensation, audit or investment committees) or special committees, to replacing or supplementing company management teams when necessary, adding outside directors with industry expertise, providing guidance on strategic and operational issues including revenue enhancement opportunities, cost savings, operating efficiencies as well as reviewing and testing annual budgets, reviewing acquisitions and divestitures, and assisting in the accessing of capital markets to further optimize financing costs and fund expansion. As active members on the board of directors, our management team members intend to evaluate the suitability of the incumbent organization leaders.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct Operational Involvement. Our management team, through ongoing board service, intend to actively engage with company management to effect change in an organization. These activities may include: (i) establishing an agenda for management and instilling a sense of accountability and urgency; (ii) aligning the interest of management with growing shareholder value; (iii) providing strategic planning and management consulting assistance; (iv) establishing measurable key performance metrics and accretive internal processes; and (v) right-sizing costs. These skill sets will be integral to shareholder value creation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Access to Portfolio Company Managers and Advisors. When appropriate, we intend to bring in outside directors, managers or consultants to assist in corporate governance and operational turnaround activities. The use of supplemental advisors should provide additional resources to management to address time intensive issues that may be delaying an organization from realizing fully its potential shareholder returns.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Status as a public company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. However there is currently no market for our securities and a market for our securities may not develop. As a result, this purported benefit may not be realized.
 
While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company. These inherent limitations include limitations on our available financial resources, which may be inferior to those of other entities pursuing the acquisition of similar target businesses; the requirement that we seek stockholder approval of a business combination or conduct a tender offer in relation thereto, which may delay the consummation of a transaction; and the existence of our outstanding warrants, which may represent a source of future dilution.

Financial position
 
With funds in the trust account of $57,500,000 available to use for a business combination (assuming no stockholder seeks conversion of their shares or seeks to sell their shares to us in a tender offer in relation to such business combination), we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. 
 
Significant Activities Since Inception
 
On February 1, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering of 5,000,000 units, each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share and one warrant, each warrant exercisable for one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-221957). The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed the private placement of 225,000 units, issued to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $2,250,000.
 
On February 8, 2018, the underwriters of our initial public offering exercised their over-allotment option in full and purchased 750,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $7.5 million. On February 8, 2018, simultaneously with the sale of the over-allotment units, we completed a private placement with our sponsor for an additional 18,750 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $187,500.
 
Approximately $57.5 million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering (including the over-allotment) and the private placements with our sponsor were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders.  
 
Our units began trading on January 30, 2018 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MTECU. Commencing on February 21, 2018, the securities comprising the units began separate trading. The units, common stock and warrants are trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “MTECU,” “MTEC” and “MTECW,” respectively.
 
As discussed above, on October 10, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, we have agreed to acquire MJF. For additional information regarding the Merger, please see the Proxy Statement.
 
Effecting a Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business until the closing of our initial business combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of founders’ units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. In the event that we do not consummate the Merger, we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
  8

 
We will have until August 1, 2019 to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate the Merger or an alternative initial business combination within the applicable time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We have evaluated and, in the event that the Merger is not consummated, we expect to continue to evaluate, opportunities that are sourced through the relationship networks of our management team, which includes numerous entrepreneurs, management teams, intermediaries and venture capital funds.
 
Our management team has considerable expertise in the evaluation of cannabis investments, with the benefit of further diligence support from our senior advisor.
 
We believe based on our management team’s business knowledge and past experience that there are numerous alternative acquisition candidates, in the event that the Merger is not consummated. We expect that our principal means of identifying potential target businesses, if the Merger is not consummated, will be through the extensive contacts and relationships of our management team. While our officers and directors are not required to commit any specific amount of time in identifying or performing due diligence on potential target businesses, our officers and directors believe that the relationships they have developed over their careers and their access to their contacts and resources will continue to generate a number of potential business combination opportunities that will warrant further investigation, if needed. We also anticipate that target business candidates may continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. They must present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income accrued in the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations. We may engage these firms or other individuals in the future in connection with the Merger or an alternative business combination, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will our sponsor, officers, directors or their respective affiliates be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than the $10,000 per month administrative services fee, the repayment of any loans from our sponsor, officers and directors for working capital purposes and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses. Our audit committee reviews and must approve all reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval. We have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsor. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (i) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and (ii) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
 
Subject to our officers’ and directors’ pre-existing fiduciary duties and the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described above in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in selecting a prospective target business. Except for the general criteria and guidelines set forth above under the caption “Acquisition Criteria,” we have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses, except that we will not invest in an entity or assets which violate, or aid and abet the violation, of federal law.
  9

 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate an alternative target business and to structure and complete the Merger or an alternative business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the Merger, if not consummated, or the identification and evaluation of an alternative prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed, will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
The target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance.
 
We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, such as in connection with the Merger. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. The fair market value of any target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
 
We are not required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. We are not required to obtain, and have not obtained, a fairness opinion in connection with the Merger.
 
10

 

Lack of Business Diversification
 
In the event that the Merger is not consummated, we may seek to effect a business combination with more than one target business, and there is no required minimum valuation standard for any target at the time of such acquisition. We expect to complete only a single business combination, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.
 
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management
 
Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. In the event the Merger is consummated, Messrs. Kane, Rehmatullah and Rothschild will serve as directors of the surviving corporation following the Merger.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
 
The Merger requires the approval of our stockholders. However, in the event that the Merger is not consummated, in connection with any alternative proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender any or all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. In connection with the Merger, we have announced that we intend to hold a special meeting of stockholders. If the Merger is not consummated, in connection with an alternative business combination, we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait until August 1, 2019 in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
 
Our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, including the founders’ shares and the shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, we would need only 2,034,376, or 35.4%, of the 5,750,000 public shares to be voted in favor of a transaction in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all shares were present and entitled to vote at the meeting).
 
If we hold a meeting to approve the Merger or an alternative proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, sponsor or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of Class A common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
 
Conversion Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, such as in connection with the Merger, public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid (which taxes may be paid only from the interest earned on the funds in the trust account). Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our Class A common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.
 
We may also require public stockholders seeking conversion, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 
Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements, such as in connection with the Merger. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “We may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures historically used by some blank check companies. Traditionally, in order to perfect conversion rights in connection with a blank check company’s business combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his conversion rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the conversion rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a “continuing” right surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert his shares is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share of Class A common stock delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the proposed business combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.

Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only until August 1, 2019 to complete an initial business combination. If we have not completed an initial business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable and up to $15,000 of any remaining interest for dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
Our sponsor, executive officers, and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination until August 1, 2019 or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer or director, or any other person. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time.
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable and up to $15,000 of any remaining interest for dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following August 1, 2019, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
  14

 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
 
We are required to use our reasonable best efforts to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you of this fact as there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriters of our initial public offering and our auditor are the only third parties we are currently aware of that may not execute a waiver. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Mr. Van Dyke has agreed that he will be personally liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that he will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if he is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement Mr. Van Dyke entered into specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity he has given: he will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have not independently verified whether Mr. Van Dyke has sufficient funds to satisfy his indemnity obligations. We have not asked Mr. Van Dyke to reserve for such indemnification obligations. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable and up to $15,000 of any remaining interest for dissolution expenses.
 
We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the founders’ shares and the shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to such founders’ shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account and the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that we are permitted to withdraw to pay such expenses.
 
In the event that we do not consummate the Merger, and if we are unable to complete an alternative initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
  15

 

Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 1, 2019 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination by August 1, 2019, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
 
The holders of the founders’ shares or shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units will not participate in any redemption distribution from our trust account with respect to such founders’ shares. Additionally, any loans made by our officers, directors, sponsors or their affiliates for working capital needs will be forgiven and not repaid if we are unable to complete an initial business combination.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after August 1, 2019, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would stop our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by August 1, 2019, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, or director, or any other person. Our sponsor, officers and directors, and other holders of our founders’ units have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any founders’ shares, shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

● | we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  16

 

● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated by August 1, 2019, then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided herein;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | upon the consummation of our initial public offering, $57.5 million was placed into the trust account;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the Class A common stock sold in our initial public offering on any matter.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
In the event we do not consummate the Merger, we may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours in identifying, evaluating and selecting an alternative target business. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of Class A common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our Class B stock converting into shares of Class A common stock as described herein; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting the Merger or an alternative business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
  17

 
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Our executive officers devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of the Merger or an alternative business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We have filed audited financial statements of MJF to be included as part of the proxy solicitation materials to be sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing MJF, and, in the event that the Merger is not consummated, we will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of another prospective target company as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer material to be sent to stockholders. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
 
We may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
