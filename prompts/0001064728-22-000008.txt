Coal Supply Agreements
Customers. Peabody’s coal supply agreements are primarily with electricity generators, industrial facilities and steel manufacturers. Most of the Company’s sales from its mining operations are made under long-term coal supply agreements (those with initial terms of one year or longer and which often include price reopener and/or extension provisions). A smaller portion of the Company’s sales from its mining operations are made under contracts with terms of less than one year, including sales made on a spot basis. Sales under long-term coal supply agreements comprised approximately 84%, 89% and 88% of the Company’s worldwide sales from its mining operations (by volume) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Peabody derived 26% of its revenues from coal supply agreements from its five largest customers. Those five customers were supplied primarily from 17 coal supply agreements (excluding trading and brokerage transactions) expiring at various times from 2022 to 2026. Peabody’s largest customer in 2021 contributed revenue of approximately $258 million, or approximately 8% of Peabody’s total revenues from coal supply agreements, and has contracts expiring at various times from 2022 to 2025. 
Backlog. Peabody’s sales backlog, which includes coal supply agreements subject to price reopener and/or extension provisions, was approximately 283 million and 264 million tons of coal as of January 1, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contracts in backlog have remaining terms ranging from one to nine years and represent approximately two years of production based on the Company’s 2021 production volume of 126.9 million tons. Approximately 57% of its backlog is expected to be filled beyond 2022. 
Seaborne Mining Operations. Revenues from Peabody’s Seaborne Thermal Mining and Seaborne Metallurgical Mining segments represented approximately 50%, 42% and 45% of its total revenues from coal supply agreements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, during which periods the coal mining activities of those segments contributed respective amounts of 18%, 19% and 17% of its sales volumes from mining operations. The Company’s production is primarily sold into the seaborne thermal and metallurgical markets, with a majority of those sales executed through annual and multi-year international coal supply agreements that contain provisions requiring both parties to renegotiate pricing periodically. Industry commercial practice, and Peabody’s typical practice, is to negotiate pricing for seaborne thermal coal contracts on an annual, spot or index basis and seaborne metallurgical coal contracts on a bi-annual, quarterly, spot or index basis. For its seaborne mining operations, the portion of sales volume under contracts with a duration of less than one year represented 45% in 2021.
U.S. Thermal Mining Operations. Revenues from Peabody’s Powder River Basin Mining and Other U.S. Thermal Mining segments, in aggregate, represented approximately 50%, 58% and 55% of its revenues from coal supply agreements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, during which periods the coal mining activities of those segments contributed respective aggregate amounts of approximately 82%, 81% and 83% of its sales volumes from mining operations. The Company expects to continue selling a significant portion of coal production from its U.S. thermal mining segments under existing long-term supply agreements. Certain customers utilize long-term sales agreements in recognition of the importance of reliability, service and predictable coal prices to their operations. The terms of coal supply agreements result from competitive bidding and extensive negotiations with customers. Consequently, the terms of those agreements may vary significantly in many respects, including price adjustment features, price reopener terms, coal quality requirements, quantity parameters, permitted sources of supply, treatment of environmental constraints, extension options, force majeure and termination and assignment provisions. Peabody’s approach is to selectively renew, or enter into new, long-term supply agreements when it can do so at prices and terms and conditions it believes are favorable. However, recent trends indicate that customers may be less likely to enter into long-term supply agreements prospectively, driven by the reduced utilization of plants and plant retirements, fluidity of natural gas pricing and the increased use of renewable energy sources.
Transportation
Methods of Distribution. Coal consumed in the U.S. is usually sold at the mine with transportation costs borne by the purchaser. Peabody’s U.S. mine sites are typically adjacent to a rail loop; however, in limited circumstances coal may be trucked to a barge site or directly to customers. Title predominately passes to the purchaser at the rail or barge, as applicable. Peabody’s U.S. and Australian export coal is usually sold at the loading port, with purchasers paying ocean freight. In each case, the Company usually pays transportation costs from the mine to the port, including any demurrage costs (fees paid to third-party shipping companies for loading time that exceeded the stipulated time). 
The Company believes it has good relationships with U.S. and Australian rail carriers and port and barge companies due, in part, to its modern coal-loading facilities and the experience of its transportation coordinators. Refer to the table in the foregoing “Mining Locations” section for a summary of transportation methods by mine.

Export Facilities. Peabody has generally secured its ability to transport coal in Australia through rail and port contracts and access to five east coast coal export terminals that are primarily funded through take-or-pay arrangements (refer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information on its take-or-pay obligations). In Queensland, seaborne thermal and metallurgical coal from the Company’s mines is exported through the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal, in addition to the Abbot Point Coal Terminal used by its joint venture Middlemount Mine. In New South Wales, the Company’s primary ports for exporting thermal and metallurgical coal are at Port Kembla and Newcastle, which includes both the Port Waratah Coal Services terminal and the terminal operated by Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group. Peabody has secured its ability to transport coal from its Shoal Creek Mine under barge and port contracts; the primary port is the McDuffie Terminal in Mobile, Alabama, which the Company utilizes without a take-or-pay arrangement.
Peabody’s U.S. thermal mining operations exported less than 1% of its annual tons sold during both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019. No tons were exported during the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary ports used for U.S. thermal exports are the United Bulk Terminal near New Orleans, Louisiana, the St. James Stevedoring Anchorages terminal in Convent, Louisiana and the Kinder Morgan terminal near Houston, Texas. 
Suppliers
Mining Supplies and Equipment. The principal goods Peabody purchases in support of its mining activities are mining equipment and replacement parts, diesel fuel, ammonium-nitrate and emulsion-based explosives, off-the-road tires, steel-related products (including roof control materials), lubricants and electricity. Peabody has many well-established, strategic relationships with its key suppliers of goods and does not believe that it is overly dependent on any of its individual suppliers.
In situations where Peabody has elected to concentrate a large portion of its purchases with one supplier, it has been to take advantage of cost savings from larger volumes of purchases, benefit from long-term pricing for parts and ensure security of supply. Supplier concentration related to the Company’s mining equipment also allows it to benefit from fleet standardization, which in turn improves asset utilization by facilitating the development of common maintenance practices across its global platform, enhancing its flexibility to move equipment between mines and reduce working capital through inventory optimization. 
Surface and underground mining equipment demand and lead times have increased in recent periods. Peabody consistently uses its global leverage with major suppliers and comprehensive planning processes to ensure security of supply to meet the requirements of its active mines. 
Services. Peabody also purchases services at its mine sites, including services related to maintenance for mining equipment, construction, temporary labor, use of explosives and various other requirements. Peabody does not believe that it has undue operational or financial risk associated with its dependence on any individual service providers.
Competition
Demand for coal and the prices that the Company will be able to obtain for its coal are highly competitive and influenced by factors beyond the Company’s control, including but not limited to global economic conditions; the demand for electricity and steel; the cost of alternative sources; the impact of weather on heating and cooling demand; taxes and environmental regulations imposed by the U.S. and foreign governments.
Thermal Coal. Demand for Peabody’s thermal coal products is impacted by economic conditions; demand for electricity, which is impacted by energy efficient products; and the cost of electricity generation from coal and alternative forms of generation. Regulatory policies and environmental, social and governance considerations can also have an impact on generation choices and coal consumption. The Company’s products compete with producers of other forms of electricity generation, including natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar and biomass, that provide an alternative to coal use. The use and price of thermal coal is heavily influenced by the availability and relative cost of alternative fuel sources and the generation of electricity utilizing alternative fuels, with customers focused on securing the lowest cost fuel supply in order to coordinate the most efficient utilization of generating resources in the economic dispatch of the power grid at the most competitive price. 
In the U.S., natural gas is highly competitive (along with other alternative fuel sources) with thermal coal for electricity generation. The competitiveness of natural gas has been strengthened by accelerated growth in domestic natural gas production and new natural gas combined cycle generation capacity. The Henry Hub Natural Gas Prompt Price averaged $3.72 per mmBtu in 2021, versus $2.13 and $2.53 per mmBtu in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, the competitiveness of other alternative fuel sources for electricity generation has been strengthened by the growth of government subsidized renewable energy generation. These pressures, coupled with increasing regulatory burdens, have contributed to a significant number of coal plant retirements. During 2021, approximately 8 gigawatts of U.S. coal power capacity was retired, and since 2010, U.S. coal power capacity has fallen by approximately thirty-two percent.

Internationally, thermal coal also competes with alternative forms of electricity generation. The competitiveness and availability of natural gas, liquefied natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar and biomass varies by country and region. Seaborne thermal coal consumption is also impacted by the competitiveness of delivered seaborne thermal coal supply from key exporting countries such as Indonesia, Australia, Russia, Colombia, the U.S. and South Africa, among others. In addition, seaborne thermal coal import demand can be significantly impacted by the availability of domestic coal production, particularly in the two leading coal import countries, China and India, among others. 
In addition to its alternative fuel source competitors, Peabody’s principal U.S. direct coal supply competitors (listed alphabetically) are other large coal producers, including Alliance Resource Partners; American Consolidated Natural Resources, Inc.; Arch Resources, Inc.; CONSOL Energy; Eagle Specialty Materials LLC; Foresight Energy; Hallador Energy; Kiewit; and Navajo Transitional Energy Company LLC, among others. Major international direct coal supply competitors (listed alphabetically) include Adaro Energy; Anglo American plc; BHP; Bumi Resources; China Shenhua Energy; Coal India Limited; Drummond Company; Glencore; South32; SUEK; Whitehaven Coal Limited; and Yancoal Australia Ltd, among others.
Metallurgical Coal. Demand for Peabody’s metallurgical coal products is impacted by economic conditions; government policies; demand for steel; and competing technologies used to make steel, some of which do not use coal as a manufacturing input, such as electric arc furnaces. The Company competes on the basis of coal quality and characteristics, delivered energy cost (including transportation costs), customer service and support and reliability of supply.
Seaborne metallurgical coal import demand can be significantly impacted by the availability of domestic coal production, particularly in leading metallurgical coal import countries such as China, among others, and the competitiveness of seaborne metallurgical coal supply from leading metallurgical coal exporting countries of Australia, the U.S., Russia, Canada, Mongolia and Mozambique, among others.
Major international direct competitors (listed alphabetically) include Anglo American; Arch Resources, Inc.; BHP; Foxleigh; Glencore; Jellinbah; KRU; Teck Resources; Warrior Met Coal; Whitehaven Coal Limited; and Yancoal Australia Ltd, among others.
Cybersecurity Risk Management
Peabody uses digital technology to conduct its business operations and engage with its customers, vendors and partners. As the Company implements newer technologies such as cloud, analytics, automation and “internet of things,” the threats to its business operations from cyber intrusions, denial of service attacks, manipulation and other cyber misconduct affecting both the Company and its partners’ technologies increase. To address the risk, the Company continues to evolve its risk management approach in an effort to continually assess and improve its cybersecurity risk detection, deterrence and recovery capabilities. Peabody’s cybersecurity strategy emphasizes reduction of cyber risk exposure and continuous improvement of its cyber defense and resilience capabilities. These include: (i) proactive management of cyber risk to ensure compliance with contractual, legal and regulatory requirements, (ii) performing due diligence on third parties to ensure they have sound cybersecurity practices in place, (iii) ensuring essential business services remain available during a business disruption, (iv) implementing data policies and standards to protect sensitive company information and (v) exercising cyber incident response plans and risk mitigation strategies to address potential incidents should they occur. 
During 2021, a software vendor that provides cloud services to the Company for its payroll function suffered a significant ransomware attack. The Company’s mitigation actions were adequate to avoid significant operational disruptions or material financial losses.
Human Capital 
Peabody had approximately 4,900 employees as of December 31, 2021, including approximately 3,900 hourly employees. Additional information on its employees and related labor relations matters is contained in Note 21. “Management — Labor Relations” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Peabody endeavors to engage with its organized workforce and foster strong relationships with those organizations built on trust and communication, which was evidenced in 2021 by successful labor negotiations at its Shoal Creek, Wambo and Metropolitan Mines.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 3,300 of Peabody’s employees are located in the U.S., with the remainder primarily located in Australia. About 94% of its team members work for mine operations in the U.S. and Australia, while the remaining are employed at its global headquarters in St. Louis or other business offices.

Under the U.S. Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981, each U.S. coal mine operator who was the last to employ a claimant for a cumulative year of employment, with the last day worked for the operator after July 1, 1973, must pay federal black lung benefits and medical expenses to claimants whose claims for benefits are allowed. Coal mine operators must also make payments to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to July 1, 1973. Historically, very few of the miners who sought federal black lung benefits were awarded these benefits; however, the approval rate has increased following implementation of black lung provisions contained in the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act included significant changes to the federal black lung program including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and establishes a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition.
The trust fund has been funded by an excise tax on U.S. production. As a result of legislation enacted in December of 2020, the excise tax rates were set at 4.4% of the gross sales price not to exceed $1.10 per ton of underground coal and $0.55 per ton of surface coal for the year ending December 31, 2021. This enacted legislation expired on December 31, 2021 and the excise tax rates reverted back to 2% of the gross sales price not to exceed $0.50 per ton of underground coal and $0.25 per ton of surface coal. On December 2, 2021 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report titled “Black Lung Benefits Program: Continued Inaction on Coal Operator Self-Insurance Increases Financial Risk to Trust Fund.” This report notes that the Department of Labor (DOL) took some steps to improve its oversight of self-insured coal mine operators, but these efforts were complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The GAO states in the report that the DOL has not taken necessary action to prevent additional benefit liabilities from being transferred to the trust fund and recommends that the DOL act on recommendations made in 2020. Subsequently, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) indicated that it plans to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the upcoming months to update its regulations authorizing coal producers to self-insure and for determining appropriate security amounts, and that it plans to solicit public comments for that proposal. A change in requirements for security posted to self-insure black lung liabilities could result in the Company being required to post additional security for its obligations. OWCP recently requested the Company to refile its application for self-insurance.
Peabody recognized expense related to the tax of $51.5 million, $53.3 million and $31.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
Peabody is subject to various federal, state, local and tribal environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations place substantial requirements on its coal mining operations, and require regular inspection and monitoring of its mines and other facilities to ensure compliance. The Company is also affected by various other federal, state, local and tribal environmental laws and regulations that impact its customers.
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. In the U.S., the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), which is administered by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), established mining, environmental protection and reclamation standards for surface mining and underground mining. Mine operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals for mining operations from the OSMRE or from the respective state regulatory authority. Where state regulatory agencies have adopted federal mining programs under SMCRA, the state becomes the primary regulatory authority, with oversight from OSMRE. States in which Peabody has active mining operations have achieved primacy control of enforcement through federal authorization. In Arizona, where Peabody will be performing reclamation work on tribal lands, the Company is regulated by the OSMRE because the tribes do not have SMCRA authorization.

SMCRA provides for three categories of bonds: surety bonds, collateral bonds and self-bonds. A surety bond is an indemnity agreement in a sum certain payable to the regulatory authority, executed by the permittee as principal and which is supported by the performance guarantee of a surety corporation. A collateral bond can take several forms, including cash, letters of credit, first lien security interest in property or other qualifying investment securities. A self-bond is an indemnity agreement in a sum certain executed by the permittee or by the permittee and any corporate guarantor made payable to the regulatory authority.
The Company’s total reclamation bonding requirements in the U.S. were $1,054.5 million as of December 31, 2021. The bond requirements for a mine represent the calculated cost to reclaim the current operations of a mine if it ceased to operate in the current period. The cost calculation for each bond must be completed according to the regulatory authority of each state or OSMRE. The Company’s asset retirement obligations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for its U.S. operations were $518.6 million as of December 31, 2021. The bond requirement amount for the Company’s U.S. operations significantly exceeds the financial liability for final mine reclamation because the asset retirement obligation liability is discounted from the end of the mine’s economic life to the balance sheet date in recognition that the final reclamation cash outlay is projected to be a number of years away. The bond amount, in contrast with the asset retirement obligation, presumes reclamation begins immediately, as well as different assumptions related to the cost of equipment and services utilized in the reclamation process.
After a permit application is prepared and submitted to the regulatory agency, it goes through a completeness and technical review. Public notice of the proposed permit is given for a comment period before a permit can be issued. Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance and the public has the right to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including public hearings and through intervention in the courts. Before a SMCRA permit is issued, a mine operator must submit a bond or other form of financial security to guarantee the performance of reclamation bonding requirements.
In situations where the Company’s coal resources are federally owned, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management oversees a substantive exploration and leasing process. If surface land is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, that agency serves as the cooperating agency during the federal coal leasing process. Federal coal leases also require an approved federal mining permit under the signature of the Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior.
The SMCRA Abandoned Mine Land Fund requires a fee on all coal produced in the U.S. The proceeds are used to rehabilitate lands mined and left unreclaimed prior to August 3, 1977 and to pay health care benefit costs of orphan beneficiaries of the Combined Fund created by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. The fee amount can change periodically based on changes in federal legislation. Pursuant to the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, from October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2021, the fee was $0.28 and $0.12 per ton of surface-mined and underground-mined coal, respectively. As a result of the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Amendments of 2021, which Congress enacted on November 15, 2021 as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2034, the fee is $0.224 and $0.096 per ton of surface-mined and underground-mine coal, respectively. The Company recognized expense related to the fees of $27.0 million, $28.4 million and $36.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Clean Air Act (CAA). The CAA, enacted in 1970, and comparable state and tribal laws that regulate air emissions affect the Company’s U.S. coal mining operations both directly and indirectly.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The CAA requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review national ambient air quality standards every five years to determine whether revision to current standards are appropriate. As part of this recurring review process, the EPA in 2020 proposed to retain the ozone standards promulgated in 2015, including current secondary standards, and subsequently promulgated final standards to this effect. Fifteen states and other petitioners have filed a petition for review of the rule in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit). The litigation is currently in abeyance following a motion filed by the EPA to allow for review of the standards. 
The EPA also proposed in 2020 to retain the particulate matter (PM) standards last revised in 2012. On December 18, 2020, the EPA issued a final rule to retain both the primary annual and 24-hour PM standards for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and the primary 24-hour standard for coarse particulate matter (PM10) and secondary PM10 standards. This rule has also been challenged in the D.C. Circuit by several states and environmental organizations. The case is currently in abeyance following a motion filed by the EPA to allow for review of the standards.
More stringent PM or ozone standards would require new state implementation plans to be developed and filed with the EPA and may trigger additional control technology for mining equipment or result in additional challenges to permitting and expansion efforts. This could also be the case with respect to other NAAQS for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), although these standards are not subject to a statutorily-required review until 2023 for NO2 and 2024 for SO2.

Final NSPS for Fossil Fuel-Fired Electricity Utility Generating Units (EGUs). The EPA promulgated a final rule to limit carbon dioxide (CO2) from new, modified and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired EGUs under Section 111(b) of the CAA on August 3, 2015, and published it in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015.
This rule requires that newly-constructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units achieve an emission standard for carbon dioxide of 1,400 lb carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour gross output (CO2/MWh-gross). The standard (known as the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER)) is based on the performance of a supercritical pulverized coal boiler implementing partial carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). Modified and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units must implement the most efficient generation achievable through a combination of best operating practices and equipment upgrades, to meet an emission standard consistent with best historical performance. Reconstructed units must implement the most efficient generating technology based on the size of the unit (supercritical steam conditions for larger units, to meet a standard of 1,800 lb CO2/MWh-gross, and subcritical conditions for smaller units to meet a standard of 2,000 lb CO2/MWh-gross).
Numerous legal challenges to the final rule were filed in the D.C. Circuit. Sixteen separate petitions for review were filed, and the challengers include 25 states, utilities, mining companies (including Peabody), labor unions, trade organizations and other groups. The cases were consolidated under the case filed by North Dakota (D.C. Cir. No. 15-1381). Four additional cases were filed seeking review of the EPA’s denial of reconsideration petitions in a final action published in the May 6, 2016 Federal Register entitled “Reconsideration of Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Generating Units; Notice of final action denying petitions for reconsideration.” Pursuant to an order of the court, these cases remain in abeyance, subject to requirements for the EPA to file 90-day status reports. 
On December 20, 2018, the EPA proposed to revise the 2015 NSPS to modify the minimum requirements for newly constructed coal-fired units from partial carbon capture and storage to efficiency-based standards. (83 Fed. Reg. 65,424 (Dec. 20, 2018)). In contrast to the 2015 rule, the proposed rule defined BSER as the most efficient demonstrated steam cycle in combination with the best operating practices. The EPA indicated that the primary reason for revising BSER was the high cost and limited geographic availability of carbon capture and storage technology. Status reports filed with the D.C. Circuit in North Dakota v. EPA indicate that litigation on the 2015 rule should remain in abeyance pending the EPA’s action on the 2018 proposed rule. 
EPA Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired EGUs. On October 23, 2015, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register regulating greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generation units (EGUs) under Section 111(d) of the CAA (80 Fed. Reg. 64,662 (Oct. 23, 2015)). The rule (known as the Clean Power Plan or CPP) established emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs. The CPP required that the states individually or collectively create systems that would reduce carbon emissions from any EGU located within their borders by 28% in 2025 and 32% in 2030 (compared with a 2005 baseline).
The EPA subsequently proposed to repeal the CPP and in August 2018 issued a proposed rule to replace the CPP, with the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule. In June 2019, the EPA issued a combined package that finalized the CPP repeal rule as well as the replacement rule, ACE. The ACE rule sets emissions guidelines for greenhouse gas emissions from existing EGUs based on a determination that efficiency heat rate improvements constitute the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER). The EPA’s final rule also revises certain regulations to give the states greater flexibility on the content and timing of their state plans.
Based on the EPA’s final rules repealing and replacing the CPP, petitioners in the D.C. Circuit matter seeking review of CPP, including the Company, filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted in September 2019.
Numerous petitions for review challenging the ACE Rule were filed in the D.C. Circuit and subsequently consolidated. In January 2021, a 3-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE Rule to the EPA, including its repeal of the CPP and amendments to the implementing regulations that extended the compliance timeline.
On October 29, 2021, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in four matters seeking review of the D.C. Circuit’s opinion vacating the ACE rule and invalidating the repeal of the CPP. In granting certiorari, the Supreme Court consolidated the cases to consider the breadth of the EPA’s scope pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 7411(d) of the CAA, specifically, issues pertaining to whether the EPA is limited to issuing standards for existing sources achievable through demonstrated technology and methods applied to such sources, or whether the EPA may also issue nationwide “performance standards” that can apply to the electric generation sector (such as cap and trade) which could effectively restructure the nation’s energy system. The Company will continue to monitor the consolidated matters.

EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Permitting Regulations for Major Emission Sources. In May 2010, the EPA published final rules requiring permitting and control technology requirements for greenhouse gases under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V permitting programs that apply to stationary sources of air pollution. The EPA determined that these requirements were “triggered” by the EPA’s prior regulation of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles. These rules were subsequently upheld by the D.C. Circuit on June 26, 2012. On June 23, 2014, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA could not require PSD and Title V permitting for greenhouse gases emitted from stationary sources if those sources were not otherwise considered to be “major sources” of conventional pollutants for purposes of PSD and Title V (known as Step 2 sources). In accordance with that decision, the D.C. Circuit vacated the federal regulations that implemented Step 2 of the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule in 2015. Subsequently, the EPA removed the vacated elements from its rules to ensure that neither the PSD nor Title V rules require a source to obtain a permit solely because the source emits or has the potential to emit greenhouse gases above the applicable thresholds. The EPA therefore no longer has the authority to conduct PSD permitting for Step 2 sources, nor can the EPA approve provisions submitted by a state for inclusion in its state implementation plan providing this authority.
Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and CSAPR Update Rule. In 2011, the EPA finalized the CSAPR, which requires the District of Columbia and 27 states from Texas eastward (not including the New England states or Delaware) to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and significantly contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. In 2016, the EPA published the final CSAPR Update Rule which imposed additional reductions in nitrogen oxides (NOx) beginning in 2017 in 22 states subject to CSAPR.
In October 2020, the EPA proposed a rule to address a previous D.C. Circuit remand of the CSAPR Update Rule and in April 2021, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register which imposed further reductions of NOx emissions in 12 states that were subject to the original 2016 rule.
In the same rule, the EPA determined that 9 states did not significantly contribute to downwind nonattainment and/or maintenance issues and therefore did not require additional emission reductions. In order to implement reductions in the 12 identified states, the EPA issued Federal Implementation Plans to lower state ozone season NOx budgets in 2021 to 2024, although limited emission trading can be used for compliance and states have the ability to replace federal plans with revised state plans that are no less stringent. A petition for review challenging the 2021 rule has been filed in the D.C. Circuit and briefing in this litigation commenced in November 2021, but this does not stay the effectiveness of the rule.
Mercury and Air Toxic Standards (MATS). The EPA published the final MATS rule in the Federal Register in 2012. The MATS rule revised the new source performance standards (NSPS) for NOx, SO2 and PM for new and modified coal-fueled electricity generating plants, and imposed maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limits on hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from new and existing coal-fueled and oil-fueled electric generating plants. MACT standards limit emissions of mercury, acid gas HAPs, non-mercury HAP metals and organic HAPs.
In 2020, the EPA issued a final rule reversing a prior finding and determined that it is not “appropriate and necessary” under the CAA to regulate HAP emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants. This rule also finalized residual risk and technology review standards for the coal- and oil-fired EGU source category. Both actions were challenged in the D.C. Circuit but this litigation was placed in abeyance. In 2021 EPA sent a draft rule to the Office of Management and Budget for review regarding reconsideration of the “appropriate and necessary” finding as well as residual risk and technology review standards for coal- and oil-fired EGUs.
Regional Haze. The Clean Air Act contains a national visibility goal for the “prevention of any future, and the remedying of any existing, impairment of visibility in Class I areas which impairment results from manmade air pollution.” The EPA promulgated comprehensive regulations in 1999 requiring all states to submit plans to address regional haze that could affect 156 national parks and wilderness areas, including requirements for certain sources to install the best available retrofit technology and for states to demonstrate “reasonable progress” towards meeting the national visibility goal. States are required to revise plans every 10 years. 
Federal Coal Leasing Moratorium. The Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth (EI Order), signed on March 28, 2017, lifted the Department of Interior’s federal coal leasing moratorium and rescinded guidance on the inclusion of social cost of carbon in federal rulemaking. Following the EI Order, the Interior Secretary issued Order 3349 ending the federal coal leasing moratorium. Environmental groups took the issue to court (District of Montana) and in April 2019, the Court held the lifting of the moratorium triggered National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review. On May 22, 2020, the Court held that the Department of the Interior’s issuance of an Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) remedied the prior NEPA violations. Environmental groups have since amended their complaint to challenge the Environmental Assessment and FONSI, and the litigation remains pending.

Clean Water Act (CWA). The CWA of 1972 directly impacts U.S. coal mining operations by requiring effluent limitations and treatment standards for wastewater discharge from mines through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Regular monitoring, reporting and performance standards are requirements of NPDES permits that govern the discharge of water from mine-related point sources into receiving waters. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates certain activities affecting navigable waters and waters of the U.S., including wetlands. Section 404 of the CWA requires mining companies to obtain permits from the Corps to place material in or mine through jurisdictional waters of the U.S.
States are empowered to develop and apply water quality standards. These standards are subject to change and must be approved by the EPA. Discharges must either meet state water quality standards or be authorized through available regulatory processes such as alternate standards or variances. Standards vary from state to state. Additionally, through the CWA Section 401 certification program, state and tribal regulators have approval authority over federal permits or licenses that might result in a discharge to their waters. State and tribal regulators consider whether the activity will comply with their water quality standards and other applicable requirements in deciding whether or not to certify the activity. Although the EPA issued a final rule in 2020 that effectively could have in effect limited state and tribal regulators’ authority by allowing the EPA to certify projects over state or tribal regulator objections in some circumstances, as a result of litigation developments this year, the 1971 certification rule is currently back in effect. The EPA plans to issue another proposal in 2022 to update the 1971 rule.
New Source Review (NSR). The Clean Air Act imposes permitting requirements when a new source undergoes construction or when an existing source is reconstructed or undergoes a major modification. These requirements are contained in the Clean Air Act’s prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) and Nonattainment New Source Review (NNSR) programs, generally referred to as NSR. On August 4, 2020, the EPA released a guidance memorandum concerning implementation of plantwide applicability limitations (PALs) (Guidance on Plantwide Applicability Limitation Provisions Under the New Source Review Regulations). PALs allow sources to make physical and operational changes under a plantwide emission limit without “triggering” NSR.
The EPA has also taken action on a number of different rules and guidance affecting the interpretation and application of NSR. In a final rule (83 Fed. Reg. 57,324 (Nov. 15, 2018)), the EPA completed reconsideration of a 2009 petition to clarify when certain actions must be “aggregated” for purposes of determining whether these actions are part of a single project to which NSR applies. The EPA has additionally published guidance on the definition of “ambient air” (Revised Policy on Exclusions from “Ambient Air,” Dec. 2, 2019) and guidance concerning when multiple air pollution-emitting activities may be considered to be “adjacent” so that they should be considered to be a single source (Interpreting “Adjacent” for New Source Review and Title V Source Determinations in All Industries Other Than Oil and Gas, Nov. 26, 2019). Additional memorandum and applicability determinations have also been made that address other NSR issues. These rules, guidance and memorandum may therefore affect the construction, reconstruction and modification of sources and the level of pollution control requirements that will be necessary on a case-by-case basis.
CWA Definition of “Waters of the United States”. In January 2020 the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) finalized the Navigable Waters Protection Rule to revise the definition of “Waters of the United States” and thereby establish the scope of federal regulatory authority under the CWA. On August 30, 2021, a federal court in Arizona vacated the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, and on September 3, 2021, the EPA and the Corps announced that they had “halted implementation” of the rule nationwide and that they are interpreting “Waters of the United States” consistent with the pre-2015 regulatory framework. On December 7, 2021, the agencies published the first of two rulemaking proceedings to formally repeal the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, codify the pre-2015 regulatory framework, and then build upon that framework. The agencies plan to issue the second proposal in 2022, but the exact timing is unclear. 
Effluent Limitations Guidelines for the Steam Electric Power Generating Industry. On September 30, 2015, the EPA published a final rule setting new or additional requirements for various wastewater discharges from steam electric power plants. The rule set zero discharge requirements for some waste streams, as well as new, more stringent limits for arsenic, mercury, selenium and nitrogen applicable to certain other waste streams. On October 13, 2020, the EPA issued a final rule revising the technology-based effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the steam electric power generating point source category applicable to flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash transport water. However, on August 3, 2021, the EPA announced it is undertaking a supplemental rulemaking to “strengthen certain discharge limits” applicable to steam electric power plants. As finalized, the revised effluent limitations guidelines could significantly increase costs for many coal-fired steam electric power plants.

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA, signed into law in 1970, requires federal agencies to review the environmental impacts of their decisions and issue either an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. Peabody must provide information to agencies when it proposes actions that will be under the authority of the federal government. The NEPA process involves public participation and can involve lengthy timeframes. The White House Council on Environmental Quality issued a final rule comprehensively updating and modernizing its longstanding NEPA regulations on July 16, 2020. That final rule sought to reduce unnecessary paperwork, burdens and delays, promote better coordination among agency decision makers, and clarify scope of NEPA reviews, among other things. States and environmental groups have filed several lawsuits challenging the final rule. On October 7, 2021, however, CEQ published a proposed rule announcing a two-phase rulemaking process to generally restore the pre-2020 NEPA regulations before more broadly revisiting the 2020 rule.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA, which was enacted in 1976, affects U.S. coal mining operations by establishing “cradle to grave” requirements for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. Typically, the only hazardous wastes generated at a mine site are those from products used in vehicles and for machinery maintenance. Coal mine wastes, such as overburden and coal cleaning wastes, are not considered hazardous wastes under RCRA.
Subtitle C of RCRA exempted fossil fuel combustion wastes from hazardous waste regulation until the EPA completed a report to Congress and made a determination on whether the wastes should be regulated as hazardous. On December 19, 2014, the EPA announced the final rule on coal combustion residuals (CCR or coal ash). As finalized, the rule continues the exemption of CCR from regulation as a hazardous waste, but does impose new requirements at existing CCR surface impoundments and landfills that will need to be implemented over a number of different time-frames in the coming months and years, as well as at new surface impoundments and landfills. Generally, EPA-imposed requirements will increase the cost of CCR management, but not as much as if the rule had regulated CCR as hazardous.
Proposed Rule for Disposal of CCR from Electric Utilities; Federal CCR Permit Program and Revisions to Closure Requirements. On February 20, 2020, as required by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, the EPA proposed a federal permitting program for the disposal of CCR in surface impoundments and landfills. Under the proposal, the EPA would directly implement the permit program in Indian Country, and at CCR units located in states that have not submitted their own CCR permit program for approval. The proposal includes requirements for federal CCR permit applications, content and modification, as well as procedural requirements. The comment period for the EPA’s proposal ended on April 20, 2020. Although EPA had planned to finalize this rule in 2021, the EPA now expects to issue a final rule around October 2022. Separately, on August 28, 2020, the EPA finalized certain amendments to its 2015 CCR rule to partially address the D.C. Circuit’s 2018 decision holding that certain provisions of that rule were not sufficiently protective. The EPA is still deciding how to further revise the 2015 rule to address the remainder of the court decision. Initially the EPA had planned to issue a proposal in mid-2021, but the EPA now expects to issue the proposal rule in September 2022. Generally, EPA-imposed requirements will increase the cost of CCR management, but not as much as if the rule had regulated CCR as hazardous.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Although generally not a prominent environmental law in the coal mining sector, CERCLA, which was enacted in 1980, nonetheless may affect U.S. coal mining operations by creating liability for investigation and remediation in response to releases of hazardous substances into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Under CERCLA, joint and several liabilities may be imposed on waste generators, site owners or operators and others, regardless of fault.
Toxic Release Inventory. Arising out of the passage of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act in 1986 and the Pollution Prevention Act passed in 1990, the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory program requires companies to report the use, manufacture or processing of listed toxic materials that exceed established thresholds, including chemicals used in equipment maintenance, reclamation, water treatment and ash received for mine placement from power generation customers.
Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA of 1973 and counterpart state legislation is intended to protect species whose populations allow for categorization as either endangered or threatened. Changes in listings or requirements under these regulations could have a material adverse effect on Peabody’s costs or its ability to mine some of its properties in accordance with its current mining plans. During the Trump Administration, the Departments of the Interior and Commerce issued finalized five rules aiming to streamline and update the ESA. But in June 2021, agencies announced their plan to revise, rescind, or reinstate the rules that were finalized (or withdrawn) during the Trump Administration that conflict with the Biden Administration’s objectives.

Use of Explosives. Peabody’s surface mining operations are subject to numerous regulations relating to blasting activities. Pursuant to these regulations, it incurs costs to design and implement blast schedules and to conduct pre-blast surveys and blast monitoring. The storage of explosives is subject to strict federal regulatory requirements. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) regulates the use of explosive blasting materials. In addition to ATF regulation, the Department of Homeland Security is expected to finalize an ammonium nitrate security program rule. On July 30, 2019, the OSMRE officially withdrew its decision to initiate rulemaking related to emissions generated from blasting at coal mining operations. The decision cited its lack of statutory authority and the sufficiency of the existing regulatory framework.
Federal Report on Climate Change. On November 23, 2018, the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a working group comprised of 13 U.S. governmental departments and agencies, issued the Fourth National Climate Assessment. The report lists the observed effects of “increasing greenhouse gas concentrations on Earth’s climate” and enumerates the impacts of those observed effects. The report also discusses the alternatives for reducing the impacts of climate-related risks, including through mitigation and adaptation. While there are no explicit regulatory actions that flow from the issuance of the report, both the legislative and executive branches of government may rely on its conclusions to shape and justify policies and actions going forward. A Fifth National Climate Assessment is currently in development with an anticipated publication date in 2023.
Regulatory Matters — Australia 
The Australian mining industry is regulated by Australian federal, state and local governments with respect to environmental issues such as land reclamation, water quality, air quality, dust control, noise, planning issues (such as approvals to expand existing mines or to develop new mines) and health and safety issues. The Australian federal government retains control over the level of foreign investment and export approvals. Industrial relations are regulated under both federal and state laws. Australian state governments also require coal companies to post deposits or give other security against land which is being used for mining, with those deposits being returned or security released after satisfactory reclamation is completed.
Mining Tenements and Environmental. In Queensland and New South Wales, the development of a mine requires both the grant of a right to extract the resource and an approval which authorizes the environmental impact. These approvals are obtained under separate legislation from separate government authorities. However, the application processes run concurrently and are also concurrent with any native title or cultural heritage process that is required. The environmental impacts of mining projects are regulated by state and federal governments. Federal regulation will only apply if the particular project will significantly impact a matter of national environmental significance (for example, a water resource, an endangered species or particular protected places). Environmental approvals processes involve complex issues that, on occasion, require lengthy studies and documentation. 
In February 2019, the New South Wales (NSW) Land and Environment Court (LEC) upheld the government’s denial of a planning approval for a non-Peabody coal mining project (Gloucester Resources Limited v. Minister for Planning). Although the approval was refused for other reasons, the judge in that case discussed ‘Scope 3’ greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the consumption of coal to be mined under the proposed project. Such emissions are often raised as a ground of objection to Australian mining projects, including Peabody’s mining projects. For example, in a subsequent LEC decision (Australian Coal Alliance Incorporated v. Wyong Coal Pty Ltd), the approval of a coal mining project was confirmed after such emissions had been considered by the relevant authority. In August 2019, Peabody and Glencore received approval from the NSW Independent Planning Commission (IPC) for the United Wambo project, subject to conditions (Export Conditions) requiring the joint venture to prepare an Export Management Plan setting out protocols for using all reasonable and feasible measures to ensure that any coal extracted from the mine that is to be exported from Australia is only exported to countries that are parties to the Paris Agreement (as defined below) or countries that the NSW Planning Secretary considers to have similar policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The IPC subsequently approved another non-Peabody coal mining project (Rix’s Creek) without any Export Conditions. In October 2019, the NSW government introduced into Parliament proposed amendments to legislation and policy that would, if passed, have the effect of invalidating Export Conditions imposed on future NSW planning approvals, as well as no longer requiring consent authorities to consider ‘downstream emissions’ when assessing developments for the purposes of mining, petroleum production or extractive industry. The NSW government has announced changes to the IPC and planning system process which aims to improve timeframes and efficiencies for project approvals and providing more clarity on the IPC’s role in determining applications including seeking guidance on government policy. In June 2020, the NSW Government released its Strategic Statement on Coal Exploration and Mining in NSW which provides a high level framework for the government's policy approach to the future of the coal sector, as well as details of a streamlined strategic release process. The strategy identifies some potential areas for possible new coal exploration, areas that are ruled out for coal mining and areas where new coal exploration can only occur adjacent to an existing coal title via the Operational Allocation process. In December 2020, the NSW Government finalized and published the Guideline for the Competitive Allocation of Coal, which details the process for considering areas for coal exploration and allocating them by public tender.

In Queensland, laws and regulations related to mining include, but are not limited to, the Mineral Resources Act 1989, Environmental Protection Act 1994 (EP Act), Environmental Protection Regulation 2008, Planning Act 2016, Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999, Minerals and Energy Resources (Common Provisions) Act 2014, Explosives Act 1999, Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003, Water Act 2000, State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971, Queensland Heritage Act 1992, Transport Infrastructure Act 1994, Nature Conservation Act 1992, Vegetation Management Act 1999, Biosecurity Act 2014, Land Act 1994, Regional Planning Interests Act 2014, Fisheries Act 1994 and Forestry Act 1959. Under the EP Act, policies have been developed to achieve the objectives of the law and provide guidance on specific areas of the environment, including air, noise, water and waste management. State planning policies address matters of Queensland state interest, and must be adhered to during mining project approvals. The Mineral Resources Act 1989 was amended effective September 27, 2016 to include significant changes to the management of overlapping coal and coal seam gas tenements, and the coordination of activities and access to private and public land. In November 2016, amendments to the EP Act and the Water Act 2000 became effective that facilitate regulatory scrutiny of the environmental impacts of underground water extraction during the operational phase of resource projects for all tenements yet to commence mineral extraction. The ‘chain of responsibility’ provisions of the EP Act, which became effective in April 2016, allow the regulator to issue an environmental protection order (EPO) to a related person of a company in two circumstances: (a) if an EPO has been issued to the company, an EPO can also be issued to a related person of the company (at the same time or later); or (b) if the company is a high risk company (as defined in the EP Act), an EPO can be issued to a related person of the company (whether or not an EPO has also been issued to the company). A guideline has been issued that provides more certainty to the industry on the circumstances in which an EPO may be issued.
In New South Wales, laws and regulations related to mining include, but are not limited to, the Mining Act 1992, Work Health and Safety (Mines) Act 2013, Coal Mine Subsidence Compensation Act 2017, Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (EPA Act), Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulations 2000, Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997, Contaminated Land Management Act 1997, Explosives Act 2003, Water Management Act 2000, Water Act 1912, Radiation Control Act 1990, Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (BC Act), Heritage Act 1977, Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983, Crown Land Management Act 2016, Dangerous Goods (Road and Rail Transport) Act 2008, Fisheries Management Act 1994, Forestry Act 2012, Native Title (New South Wales) Act 1994, Biosecurity Act 2015, Roads Act 1993 and National Parks & Wildlife Act 1974. 
Under the EPA Act, environmental planning instruments must be considered when approving a mining project development application. Decision makers review the significance of a resource and the state and regional economic benefits of a proposed coal mine when considering a development application on the basis that it is an element of the “public interest” consideration contained in the relevant legislation. Effective from March 1, 2018, the EPA Act was amended to introduce a number of changes to planning laws in New South Wales. The EPA Act was further amended in June 2018 to revoke a process for modifying development approvals under the former Section 75W of the EPA Act. As a result, new development approvals will need to be obtained unless the proposed project will be substantially the same development as it was when the development approval was last modified under Section 75W, in which case the existing development approval can be modified. If a new development approval is required then this could take additional time to achieve.
On August 25, 2017, the BC Act commenced in New South Wales and imposes a revised framework for the assessment of potential impacts on biodiversity that may be caused by a development, such as a proposed mining project. The BC Act requires these potential impacts on biodiversity to be offset in perpetuity, by one or more of the following means: securing land based offsets and retiring biodiversity credits, making a payment into a biodiversity conservation fund or in some cases through mine site ecological rehabilitation. The data collected from the biodiversity impact assessment process is inputted into a new offsets payment calculator in order to determine the amount payable by the proponent to offset the impacts. The proposed development can only proceed once the biodiversity offset obligations have been satisfied.
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standards and Assurance) Bill 2021. On February 25, 2021 the Commonwealth Government introduced the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standards and Assurance) Bill 2021 into Parliament, which proposes amendments to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) following the release of the Final Report of the Independent Review of the Act undertaken by Professor Graeme Samuel (the Samuel Review) that made 38 recommendations for short and long-term reforms, and ultimately calls for a complete overhaul of the existing legislative framework by 2022, to be undertaken in several tranches, with a strong focus on the setting of National Environmental Standards, assurance and compliance, data availability and management, and indigenous engagement. The bill responds to some of the recommendations for immediate reform made in the Samuel Review, and seeks to: establish a framework for the making, varying, revoking and application of National Environmental Standards; apply the National Environmental Standards to bilateral agreements with States and Territories; and establish an Environment Assurance Commissioner to monitor and audit bilateral agreements and other processes under the EPBC Act. The bill passed the Australian Parliament’s House of Representatives in June 2021 and is now under consideration by the Australian Senate.

Mining Rehabilitation (Reclamation). Mine reclamation is regulated by state-specific legislation. As a condition of approval for mining operations, companies are required to progressively reclaim mined land and provide appropriate bonding, or, in certain circumstances (see below in relation to the Mineral and Energy Resources (Financial Provisioning) Act 2018), make alternative financial contributions to the relevant state government as a safeguard to cover the costs of reclamation in circumstances where mine operators are unable to do so. Self-bonding is not permitted. Peabody’s mines provide financial assurance to the relevant authorities which is calculated in accordance with current regulatory requirements. This financial assurance is in the form of cash, surety bonds or bank guarantees which are supported by a combination of cash collateral, deeds of indemnity and guarantee and letters of credit issued under the Company’s credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program. The Company operates in both the Queensland and New South Wales state jurisdictions. 
Peabody’s reclamation bonding requirements in Australia were $240.2 million as of December 31, 2021. The bond requirements represent the states’ calculated cost to reclaim the current operations of a mine if it ceases to operate in the current period less any discounts agreed with the state. The cost calculation for each bond must be completed according to the regulatory authority of each state. The costs associated with the Company’s Australian asset retirement obligations are calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and were $201.2 million as of December 31, 2021. The total bonding requirements for the Company’s Australian operations differ from the calculated costs associated with the asset retirement obligations because the costs associated with asset retirement obligations are discounted from the end of the mine’s economic life to the balance sheet date in recognition of the economic reality that reclamation is conducted progressively and final reclamation is projected to be a number of years away, whereas the bonding amount represents the states’ calculated cost of reclamation if a mine ceases to operate immediately as well as different costs assumptions.
New South Wales Reclamation. The Mining Act 1992 (Mining Act) is administered by the Department of Planning and Environment and the New South Wales Resources Regulator, and authorizes the holder of a mining tenement to extract a mineral subject to obtaining consent under the EPA Act and other auxiliary approvals and licenses.
Through the Mining Act, environmental protection and reclamation are regulated by conditions in all mining leases including requirements for the submission of a mining operations plan (MOP) prior to the commencement of operations. All mining operations must be carried out in accordance with the MOP which describes site activities and the progress toward environmental and reclamation outcomes and are updated on a regular basis or if mine plans change. The mines publicly report their reclamation performance on an annual basis.
In support of the MOP process, a reclamation cost estimate is calculated periodically to determine the amount of bond support required to cover the cost of reclamation based on the extent of disturbance during the MOP period.
Under significant reforms proposed by the NSW Resources Regulator in October 2020, all new and existing mines in NSW will be regulated by new standard rehabilitation conditions. The conditions will apply to all new and existing mining leases and focus on transparently requiring progressive mine site rehabilitation throughout the life of the mine. The draft Mining Amendment (Standard Conditions of Mining Leases - Rehabilitation) Regulation 2020 has been released for consultation. The new conditions would apply to all new mining leases and would be introduced into existing mining leases over a 12 to 24 month transition period. The conditions require (amongst other things) that the leaseholder must rehabilitate land and water in the mining area that is disturbed by activities under the mining lease as soon as reasonably practicable after the disturbance occurs. The proposed rehabilitation management plan for the mining area which must be prepared for large mines is intended to replace the current approach of preparing a mining operation plan.
Queensland Reclamation. The EP Act is administered by the Department of Environment and Science, which authorizes environmentally relevant activities such as mining activities relating to a mining lease through an Environmental Authority (EA). Environmental protection and reclamation activities are regulated by conditions in the EA. All mining operations must be carried out in a manner so as to ensure compliance with the conditions in the EA. The mines submit an annual return reporting on their EA compliance.
In November 2018, the Queensland government passed the Mineral and Energy Resources (Financial Provisioning) Act 2018 providing for a new financial assurance (FA) framework and new progressive rehabilitation requirements. The new FA framework creates a pooled fund covering most mines and most of the total industry liability, plus other options for providing FA if not part of the pooled fund (for example, allowing insurance bonds or cash). The percentage rate of the total rehabilitation cost payable into the pooled fund will take into account the financial strength of the holder of the EA for the mine and the project strength of the mine. The total rehabilitation cost is determined using an updated rehabilitation cost calculator, which no longer provides for discounting. The commencement date for the new FA framework was April 1, 2019 and there is a transitional period during which Peabody will move each of its mines in Queensland into the new FA framework.

Table of Contents

The new progressive rehabilitation requirements commenced on November 1, 2019 and require each mine, within a three-year transitional period, to establish a schedule of rehabilitation milestones covering the life of the mine, and any significant changes to the timing of rehabilitation will require regulatory approval. If there is to remain an area within the mine that does not have a post-mining land use (referred to as a non-use management area or NUMA) then each such NUMA will need to pass a public interest evaluation test as part of the approval process. An example of a NUMA is the void that remains after open-cut mining activities have been completed. Under the legislation, each current mine is exempt from the requirement to justify its NUMAs to the extent that its current approvals provide for such areas. The Company is of the view that there will not be a need to seek any further regulatory approvals for any of the NUMAs at any of its Queensland mines.
Residual Risks. On August 20, 2020, the Environmental Protection and Other Legislation Amendment Act (Queensland) 2020 (EPOLA Act) became law amending the residual risk framework that aims to ensure that any remaining risks on former resource sites are appropriately identified, costed and managed. On completion of all mining activities, the holder of the EA for the mine can apply to surrender the EA once all conditions, requirements and rehabilitation obligations have been met. When approving the surrender, the government can request a residual risk payment from the holder of the EA for the mine to cover potential rehabilitation or maintenance costs incurred after the surrender has been accepted. It contemplates two approaches for determining residual risk payments. Depending on the level of risk of a particular site, a cost calculator tool might be used or a panel of appropriately qualified experts might undertake a qualitative and quantitative risk assessment. 
Federal Reclamation. In February 2017, the Australian Senate established a Committee of Inquiry into the rehabilitation of mining and resources projects as it relates to Commonwealth responsibilities, for example, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The Committee released their report in March 2019. The Committee was unable to reach unanimous agreement on a set of recommendations. It is unclear the extent to which the report will impact policy reform at a federal government level.
Native Title and Cultural Heritage. Since 1992, the Australian courts have recognized that native title to lands and water, as recognized under the laws and customs of the Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, may have survived the process of European settlement. These developments are supported by the federal Native Title Act which recognizes and protects native title, and under which a national register of native title claims has been established. Native title rights do not extend to minerals; however, native title rights can be affected by mining activities unless those rights have previously been extinguished, thereby requiring negotiation with the traditional owners (and potentially the payment of compensation) prior to the grant of certain mining tenements. There is also federal and state legislation to prevent damage to Aboriginal cultural heritage and archaeological sites.
Following the May 2020 destruction of caves at the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia by an iron ore mining operation, the Federal Government established a Senate Inquiry. The Inquiry’s terms of reference included reviewing the effectiveness and adequacy of state and federal laws in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural heritage in each of the Australian jurisdictions; and how these cultural heritage laws might be improved to guarantee the protection of culturally and historically significant sites. Following an interim report released on December 9, 2020, the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia released its final report on October 18, 2021. The final report sets out three key findings and eight recommendations, including that a new framework for cultural heritage protection be implemented at a national level by way of new legislated national minimum standards for State and Territory laws. The recommendations also include that a review of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) be undertaken to address inequalities in the negotiating position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the future act regime, including the ‘right to negotiate’ process which is associated with the grant of certain mining tenements. Any legislation passed as a result of the recommendations in the final report could potentially impact the Company’s current and future mining tenements and operations.
Occupational Health and Safety. State legislation requires Peabody to provide and maintain a safe workplace by providing safe systems of work, safety equipment and appropriate information, instruction, training and supervision. In recognition of the specialized nature of mining and mining activities, specific occupational health and safety obligations have been mandated under state legislation specific to the coal mining industry. There are some differences in the application and detail of the laws, and mining operators, directors, officers and certain other employees are all subject to the obligations under this legislation.

In September 2020, Safe Work Australia (SWA) published its revised Workplace Exposure Standards (WES) for coal dust and silica based on toxicological information and other monitoring data. SWA have recommended exposure limits of 1.5 mg/m3 for coal dust (to apply from October 2022) and 0.05 mg/m3 for silica (to apply as soon as possible). In Queensland, a new workplace exposure standard for respirable crystalline silica (eight hour time-weighted average airborne concentration of 0.05 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3)) took effect from July 1, 2020. In New South Wales, the new respirable crystalline silica workplace exposure standard of 0.05 mg/m3 commenced on July 1, 2020. The respirable coal dust workplace exposure standard of 2.5 mg/m3 was reduced to 1.5 mg/m3 on February 1, 2021 and mines need to report exceedances of the new exposure standard to the NSW Resources Regulator from this date. NSW is the first mining jurisdiction in Australia to implement an exposure standard for diesel particulate matter with the exposure standard of 0.1 mg/m3 which became enforceable on February 1, 2021.
In addition, as part of a broader review of workplace exposure standards, SWA is currently considering a proposal to reduce the time weighted average (TWA) Workplace Exposure Standard (WES) for carbon dioxide (CO2) in Australian coal mines from 12,500 ppm to 5,000 ppm. Currently there is a separate TWA for CO2 in coal mines however SWA proposes to remove this to align with a general industry standard. If implemented, the change has the potential to affect underground mines operating in CO2 rich coal seams, including the primary coal seam of the Company’s Metropolitan Mine. Importantly, a minimum three-year transition period applies for any change to standards.
On July 1, 2020, the Resources Safety and Health Queensland Act 2020 became effective. It establishes Resources Safety and Health Queensland (RSHQ) as a statutory body designed to ensure independence of the mining safety and health regulator. RSHQ includes inspectorates for coal mines, mineral mines and quarries, explosives and petroleum and gas. The new law seeks to enhance the role of advisory committees to identify, quantify and prioritize safety and health issues in the mining and quarrying industries. It also provides for an independent Work Health and Safety Prosecutor to prosecute serious offenses under resources safety legislation.
On May 20, 2020, the Queensland Parliament passed a bill into law that introduces the criminal offense of ‘industrial manslaughter’ for executive officers, individuals who are “senior officers” and companies in the mining industry. Individuals now face a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and companies could be fined up to approximately $13 million Australian dollars. This new law became effective July 1, 2020. The bill also introduced the requirement for statutory role holders to be employees of the coal mine operator entity with an 18-month transition period ending November 25, 2022.
Industrial Relations. A national industrial relations system, the Fair Work Act and National Employment Standards, administered by the federal government applies to all employers and employees. The matters regulated under the national system include general employment conditions, unfair dismissal, enterprise bargaining, bullying claims, industrial action and resolution of workplace disputes. Most of the hourly workers employed in the Company’s mines are also covered by the Black Coal Mining Industry Award and company specific enterprise agreements approved under the national system.
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER Act). The NGER Act imposes requirements for corporations meeting a certain threshold to register and report greenhouse gas emissions and abatement actions, as well as energy production and consumption as part of a single, national reporting system. The Clean Energy Regulator administers the NGER Act. The federal Department of Environment and Energy is responsible for NGER Act-related policy developments and review.
On July 1, 2016, amendments to the NGER Act implemented the Emissions Reduction Fund Safeguard Mechanism. From that date, large designated facilities such as coal mines were issued with a baseline for their covered emissions and must take steps to keep their emissions at or below the baseline or face penalties.
The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Safeguard Mechanism) Rule 2015 outlines key elements of a responsible emitter’s duty to avoid an excess emissions situation and provides detail on how it can meet that requirement. The Rule was amended between 2019 and 2021 to transition responsible emitters to new baseline setting arrangements. From the start of the 2020-21 compliance year, baselines must use prescribed production variables (an example being run of mine coal) and default emissions intensity values (being values set by the Government to represent the industry average emissions intensity of production over five years) unless specific exemptions apply (such as a facility having site-specific values set).
Queensland Royalty. As part of the Queensland Government’s 2019-20 Budget, the Government committed to freeze royalty rates on coal and minerals for three years, provided companies voluntarily contribute to a Resource Community Infrastructure Fund (the Fund) over this three-year period. The Government contributes $30 million Australian dollars towards the Fund, with companies voluntarily contributing $70 million Australian dollars. Peabody’s contribution to the Fund was approximately $522,000 Australian dollars for the 2020-21 financial year and $713,000 Australian dollars for the 2019-20 financial year. Peabody’s contribution is expected to further decrease in year three based on an expected reduction in production at its Queensland mines.

New South Wales Royalty. In New South Wales, the royalty applicable to coal is charged as a percentage of the value of production (total revenue less allowable deductions). This is equal to 6.2% for deep underground mines (coal extracted at depths greater than 400 meters below ground surface), 7.2% for underground mines and 8.2% for open-cut mines.
Sydney Water Catchment Areas. In November 2017, the New South Wales government established an independent expert panel (Panel) to advise the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) on the impact of underground mining activities in Sydney’s water catchment areas, including at the Company’s Metropolitan Mine. The Panel issued its final report in October 2019. The final report makes findings and recommendations concerning mining activities and effects across the catchment as a whole.
The DPIE considered the recommendations in the Panel’s final report and in April 2020 announced that it had accepted all 50 recommendations in the Panel’s report, and that it has established an interagency taskforce to implement a detailed action plan during 2020. The action plan includes: ensuring there is a net gain for the metropolitan water supply by requiring more offsetting from mining companies; establishing a new independent expert panel to advise on future mining applications in the catchment; strengthening surface and groundwater monitoring; improving access to and transparency of environmental data; adopting a more stringent approach to the assessment and conditioning of future mining proposals to minimize subsidence impacts; reviewing and updating current and potential future water losses from mining in line with the best available science; introducing a licensing regime to properly account for any water losses; and undertaking further research into mine closure planning to reduce potential long-term impacts.
Risks Related to Global Climate Change
Peabody recognizes that climate change is occurring and that human activity, including the use of fossil fuels, contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Company’s largest contribution to GHG emissions occurs indirectly, through the coal used by its customers in the generation of electricity and the production of steel (Scope 3). To a lesser extent, the Company directly and indirectly contributes to GHG emissions from various aspects of its mining operations, including from the use of electrical power and combustible fuels, as well as from the fugitive methane emissions associated with coal mines and stockpiles (Scopes 1 and 2).
Peabody’s board of directors and management believe that coal is essential to affordable, reliable energy and will continue to play a significant role in the global energy mix for the foreseeable future. Peabody views technology as vital to advancing global climate change solutions, and the company supports advanced coal technologies to drive continuous improvement toward the ultimate goal of net-zero emissions from coal.
The board of directors has ultimate oversight for climate-related risk and opportunity assessments, and has delegated certain aspects of these assessments to subject matter committees of the board. In addition, the board and its committees are provided regular updates on major risks and changes, including climate-related matters. The senior management team champions the strategic objectives set forth by the board of directors and Peabody’s global workforce turns those objectives into meaningful actions.
Management believes that the Company’s external communications, including environmental regulatory filings and public notices, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, its annual Environmental, Social and Governance Report, its website and various other stakeholder-focused publications provide a comprehensive picture of the Company’s material risks and progress. All such communications are subject to oversight and review protocols established by Peabody’s board of directors and executive leadership team.
The Company faces risks from both the global transition to a net-zero emissions economy and the potential physical impacts of climate change. Such risks may involve financial, policy, legal, technological, reputational and other impacts as the Company meets various mitigation and adaptation requirements.

The transition to a net-zero emissions economy is driven by many factors, including, but not limited to, legislative and regulatory rulemaking processes, campaigns undertaken by non-governmental organizations to minimize or eliminate the use of coal as a source of electricity generation, and the ESG-related policies of financial institutions and other private companies. The Company has experienced, or may in the future experience, negative effects on its results of operations due to the following specific risks as a result of such factors:
•Reduced utilization or closure of existing coal-fired electricity generating plants;
•Electricity generators switching from coal to alternative fuels, when feasible;
•Increased costs associated with regulatory compliance;
•Unfavorable impact of regulatory compliance on supply and demand fundamentals, such as limitations on financing or construction of new coal-fueled power stations;
•Uncertainty and inconsistency in rulemaking processes related to periodic governmental administrative and policy changes;
•Unfavorable costs of capital and access to financial markets and products due to the policies of financial institutions;
•Disruption to operations or markets due to anti-coal activism and litigation; and
•Reputational damage associated with involvement in GHG emissions.
With respect to the potential or actual physical impacts of climate change, the Company has identified the following specific risks:
•Disruption to water supplies vital to mining operations;
•Disruption to transportation and other supply chain activities;
•Damage to the Company’s, customers’ or suppliers’ plant and equipment, or third-party infrastructure, resulting from weather events or changes in environmental trends and conditions; and
•Electrical grid failures and power outages.
While the Company faces numerous risks associated with the transition to a net-zero emissions economy and the physical impacts of climate change, certain opportunities may also emerge, such as:
•Heightened emphasis among multiple stakeholders to develop high-efficiency, low-emissions (HELE) technologies and carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) technologies;
•Increased steel demand related to construction and other infrastructure projects related to climate change concerns; and
•The relative expense and reliability of renewable energy sources compared to coal may encourage support for balanced-source energy policies and regulations.
Global climate issues continue to attract public and scientific attention. Numerous reports, such as the Fourth and the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have also engendered concern about the impacts of human activity, especially fossil fuel combustion, on global climate issues. In turn, increasing government attention is being paid to global climate issues and to GHG emissions, including emissions of carbon dioxide from coal combustion by power plants. There have been significant developments in federal and state legislation and regulation and international accords regarding climate change. Such developments are described below in the section “Regulations Related to Global Climate Change” within this Item 1.
The enactment of future laws or the passage of regulations regarding emissions from the use of coal by the U.S., some of its states or other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. Further, policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power stations could adversely impact the global demand for coal in the future. The potential financial impact on Peabody of such future laws, regulations or other policies will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws, regulations or other policies, the time periods over which those laws, regulations or other policies would be phased in, the state of development and deployment of CCUS technologies as well as acceptance of CCUS technologies to meet regulations and the alternative uses for coal. Higher-efficiency coal-fired power plants may also be an option for meeting laws or regulations related to emissions from coal use. Several countries, including major coal users such as China, India and Japan, included using higher-efficiency coal-fueled power plants in their plans under the Paris Agreement. The Company believes HELE and CCUS technologies should be part of the solution to achieve substantial reductions in GHG emissions and should be broadly supported and encouraged, including through eligibility for public funding from national and international sources. In addition, CCUS merits targeted deployment incentives, like those provided to other low-emission sources of energy.

From time to time, the Company’s board of directors and management attempt to analyze the potential impact on the Company of as-yet-unadopted, potential laws, regulations and policies. Such analyses require significant assumptions as to the specific provisions of such potential laws, regulations and policies which sometimes show that if implemented in the manner assumed by the analyses, the potential laws, regulations and policies could result in material adverse impacts on the Company’s operations, financial condition or cash flows. Such analyses cannot be relied upon to reasonably predict the quantitative impact that future laws, regulations or other policies may have on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Regulations Related to Global Climate Change
In the U.S., Congress has considered legislation addressing global climate issues and greenhouse gas emissions, but to date, no such legislation has been signed into law. While it is possible that the U.S. will adopt legislation in the future, the timing and specific requirements of any such legislation are uncertain. In the absence of new U.S. federal legislation, the EPA has taken steps to regulate greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to the CAA. In response to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA, the EPA commenced several rulemaking projects as described under “Regulatory Matters - U.S.” In particular, in 2015, the EPA announced final rules (known as the CPP) for regulating carbon dioxide emissions from existing and new fossil fuel-fired EGUs. Twenty-seven states and governmental entities, as well as utilities, industry groups, trade associations, coal companies (including Peabody), and other entities, challenged the CPP in federal court. Implementation of the CPP was stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court pending resolution of its legal challenges. In October 2017, the EPA proposed to change its legal interpretation of section 111(d) of the CAA, the authority that the agency relied on for the original CPP. The EPA relied on the proposed reinterpretation until August 2018, when it proposed the Affordable Clean Energy Rule (the ACE Rule) to replace the CPP with a system where states would develop emissions reduction plans using BSER measures (essentially efficiency heat rate improvements), and the EPA would approve the state plans if they use EPA-approved candidate technologies. Changes in the NSR program were also proposed to allow efficiency improvements to be made without triggering NSR requirements. In September 2019, the ACE Rule, which provides states with the flexibility to regulate on a plant-by-plant basis with a focus on coal-fired EGUs, became effective and the CPP was repealed. Proposed revisions to the regulations under the NSR program that were part of the ACE proposal were separated and the EPA indicated that it intends to take final action on the proposed NSR program reforms at a later date. Following the effectiveness of the ACE Rule, the case challenging the CPP in federal court was dismissed as being moot. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the ACE Rule and its repeal of the CPP were to be vacated and remanded to the EPA. It also vacated amendments to the implementing regulations that extended the compliance timeline.
At the same time, a number of states in the U.S. have adopted programs to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. For example, 10 northeastern states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont) entered into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in 2005, and Pennsylvania is expected to join in 2022. RGGI is a mandatory cap-and-trade program to cap regional carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Six mid-western states (Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin) and one Canadian province have entered into the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (MGGRA) to establish voluntary regional greenhouse gas reduction targets and develop a voluntary multi-sector cap-and-trade system to help meet the targets. It has been reported that, while the MGGRA has not been formally suspended, the participating states are no longer pursuing it. Seven western states (Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington) and four Canadian provinces entered into the Western Climate Initiative (WCI) in 2008 to establish a voluntary regional greenhouse gas reduction goal and develop market-based strategies to achieve emissions reductions. However, in November 2011, the WCI announced that six states had withdrawn from the WCI, leaving California and four Canadian provinces as the remaining members. Of those five jurisdictions, only California and Quebec have adopted greenhouse gas cap-and-trade regulations to date and both programs have begun operating. Many of the states and provinces that left WCI, RGGI and MGGRA, along with many that continue to participate, have joined the new North America 2050 initiative, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create economic opportunities in ways not limited to cap-and-trade programs.
Several other U.S. states have enacted legislation establishing greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals or requirements. In addition, several states have enacted legislation or have in effect regulations requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power or that provide financial incentives to electricity suppliers for using renewable energy sources. Some states have initiated public utility proceedings that may establish values for carbon emissions.
Increasingly, both foreign and domestic banks, insurance companies and large investors are curtailing or ending their financial relationships with fossil fuel-related companies. This has had adverse impacts on the liquidity and operations of coal producers.

Peabody participated in the Department of Energy’s Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program until its suspension in May 2011, and the Company regularly discloses information regarding its production-related emissions in its annual Environmental, Social and Governance Report. The vast majority of the Company’s emissions are generated by the operation of heavy machinery to extract and transport material at its mines and fugitive emissions from the extraction of coal.
The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in December 1997 by the signatories to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), established a binding set of greenhouse gas emission targets for developed nations. The U.S. signed the Kyoto Protocol but it has never been ratified by the U.S. Senate. Australia ratified the Kyoto Protocol in December 2007 and became a full member in March 2008. There were discussions to develop a treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol after the expiration of its commitment period in 2012, including at the UNFCCC conferences in Cancun (2010), Durban (2011), Doha (2012) and Paris (2015). At the Durban conference, an ad hoc working group was established to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the UNFCCC, applicable to all parties. At the Doha meeting, an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, which included new commitments for certain parties in a second commitment period, from 2013 to 2020. In December 2012, Australia signed on to the second commitment period. During the UNFCCC conference in Paris, France in late 2015, an agreement was adopted calling for voluntary emissions reductions contributions after the second commitment period ends in 2020 (the Paris Agreement). The agreement was entered into force on November 4, 2016 after ratification and execution by more than 55 countries, including Australia, that account for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions. On January 20, 2021, the U.S. reentered the Paris Agreement by accepting the agreement and all of its articles and clauses, after having announced its withdrawal from the agreement in November 2019.
In October 2017, the Australian Federal Government released a plan aimed at delivering an affordable and reliable energy system that meets Australia’s international commitments to emissions reduction. The plan was referred to as the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) and was aimed at changing the National Electricity Market and associated legislative framework. The NEG was abandoned by the Australian government in September 2018. Following the outcome of the federal election in May 2019, the federal government confirmed it will not revive the former NEG policy. Instead, the government will pursue a new energy and climate change policy, which includes a $2 billion Australian dollars investment in projects to bring down Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. The Climate Solutions Fund is an extension of the former Emissions Reduction Fund. The government has confirmed that it remains committed to meeting Australia’s Paris Agreement targets but that the focus of energy policy will be on driving down electricity prices.
