Overview
 We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T cell engagers that harness the power of the body’s immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases. T cell engagers are engineered proteins that direct a patient’s own T cells to kill target cells that express specific proteins, or antigens, carried by the target cells. Using our proprietary Tri-specific T cell Activating Construct, or TriTAC, platform, we are developing a pipeline of novel T cell engagers, or TriTACs, initially focused on the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Since commencing operations in 2015, we have created four TriTAC product candidates, each of which we expect to be in clinical development by the end of 2020. Our lead TriTAC product candidate, HPN424, is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC. In January 2019, we announced preliminary data from this trial that supports the proposed mechanism of action of HPN424. Our second TriTAC product candidate, HPN536, is expected to enter clinical development in the first half of 2019 for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other MSLN-expressing solid tumors. 
 In January 2019, we announced preliminary data from seven patients who had been enrolled in our Phase 1 clinical trial of HPN424, as of December 31, 2018. Safety and tolerability are the primary objectives of the trial and as of December 31, 2018, all seven patients remained on the study, receiving weekly treatments of HPN424 with no dose limiting toxicities. Our secondary objectives include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, as well as preliminary anti-tumor activity. The clinical trial results to date include measurement of HPN424 serum exposure that supports weekly dosing and changes in cell and serum biomarkers consistent with T cell activation. 
 Our TriTACs are designed to advance the therapeutic potential of T cell engagers, an established and meaningful mechanism of action. The first bi-specific T cell engager, or BiTE, to be approved by the FDA was, Amgen’s Blincyto. Blincyto was approved in 2014 as a monotherapy for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Since then, other BiTEs have shown promising therapeutic potential in clinical trials. We developed our proprietary TriTAC platform to incorporate the strengths of BiTEs and improve upon their critical shortcomings, such as a short half life. We believe our TriTAC platform offers the following features for the discovery and development of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of a wide array of diseases, including cancer: 
  
• | Active at Low Levels of Target Expression. We designed TriTACs to be active at low levels of antigen expression where other treatment modalities lose efficacy. In our preclinical studies, TriTACs did not require high levels of target antigen expression to engage T cells to kill disease cells. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MHC Independence. We designed TriTACs to specifically direct T cells to kill target cells independent of MHC expression. Tumor cells frequently acquire mutations that change the MHC molecule or reduce the level of MHC expressed on their surfaces, thus making the tumor cells less susceptible to being killed by either endogenous T cells or engineered T cells that require MHC recognition. We believe that because TriTACs do not require a T cell clone with specific T cell receptor or MHC recognition to kill tumor cells, they will be able to generate greater and more durable therapeutic responses than MHC dependent approaches. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extended Half-Life and Stability. We designed TriTACs to be stable in the bloodstream and to have a long-serum half-life in order to achieve efficacy without requiring the continuous IV administration that is a limiting requirement of other T cell engagers, such as BiTEs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Small Size and Tissue Penetration. TriTACs are small in size, and we believe this is critical for their efficient penetration of, and diffusion within, solid tumors. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Modularity. The TriTAC structure is modular and its antigen binding domain can easily be switched out to enable the rapid discovery and development of new TriTAC product candidates across a wide variety of targets. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety Design Elements. We designed TriTACs to enable T cell engagement while minimizing off-target toxicity and the potential for CRS, which is a potentially lethal reaction of the body to the hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conventional Manufacturing. TriTACs are “off-the-shelf” therapies, the manufacturing of which is significantly less complex than that of personalized or cell-based therapies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our lead TriTAC product candidate, HPN424, is in clinical development for the treatment of prostate cancer. Nearly all prostate cancer-specific deaths occur after patients develop mCRPC, which kills an estimated 29,000 patients in the United States each year. We have designed HPN424 to target PSMA, which is present in 80-95% of patients with mCRPC tumor lesions. In April 2018, data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Conference demonstrated encouraging clinical responses of Amgen’s BiTE targeting PSMA in mCRPC patients. However, this product candidate, AMG212, requires continuous IV infusion, which could limit its adoption and accessibility. In contrast, we designed our TriTACs to benefit from extended serum half-life to enable more convenient dosing, and HPN424 is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of mCRPC with once-weekly IV dosing. In January 2019, we announced preliminary data from seven patients who had been enrolled in this clinical trial as of December 31, 2018. The clinical trial results to date include measurement of HPN424 serum exposure that supports weekly dosing. We expect to provide additional preliminary data from this clinical trial at a medical conference in the second half of 2019. 
 Our second TriTAC product candidate, HPN536, is in development for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other MSLN-expressing tumors. MSLN, a clinically validated target, is expressed on malignant cells of mesothelioma, ovarian carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, NSCLC and TNBC, among others. In our preclinical studies, we have observed HPN536’s promising in vitro and in vivo activity in MSLN-expressing cancers. Our IND for HPN536 took effect in January 2019, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in the first half of 2019.  
 We also have two TriTAC product candidates in preclinical development targeting tumor-associated antigens for the treatment of multiple myeloma and SCLC, for which we expect to file INDs in 2019 and 2020, respectively. 
 To further expand the universe of addressable targets and indications, we are actively developing our proprietary ProTriTAC platform, which applies a prodrug concept that creates a therapeutic T cell engager that is designed to remain inactive until it reaches the tumor. We are in the discovery phase with respect to several ProTriTAC product candidates and expect to advance our first ProTriTAC product candidate into IND-enabling studies in 2019. 
 We aim to selectively collaborate with leading biopharmaceutical companies to leverage our platform. For example, in October 2017 we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with AbbVie, pursuant to which we granted to AbbVie worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products that incorporate our proprietary TriTAC technology together with soluble TCRs provided by AbbVie that bind to targets accepted by the parties. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, AbbVie is allowed to designate up to two targets, subject to confirmation of target availability. In addition to an upfront payment of $17 million, AbbVie will be required to make further payments to us of up to $600 million in the aggregate, for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sale milestones for licensed products indicated for human therapeutic or prophylactic use, if such licensed products are successfully progressed against all included targets and indications. We will also receive tiered royalties on net sales by AbbVie, its affiliates and sublicensees of licensed products at percentages in the mid-single digits, subject to specified offsets and reductions. 
 Our company is led by a strong management team with deep experience in immunotherapy, redirected T cell therapies, biologics drug discovery and development and protein engineering. Our management team has experience at leading biopharmaceutical companies such as Aduro BioTech Inc., Amgen Inc., Dyax Corp., Nektar Therapeutics, Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc., Pfizer Inc., Seattle Genetics, Inc. and Tularik Inc. This team brings a strong history of research and development innovation and a proven track record at other companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of oncology therapeutics including Adcetris, Blincyto, Cometriq, Kyprolis, Sorafenib and Sutent.

Our Pipeline 
 We are leveraging our proprietary TriTAC and ProTriTAC platforms to discover and develop product candidates to treat cancer and other diseases. The following table summarizes key information about our product candidates to date, all of which were developed using our TriTAC platform. We own the intellectual property rights to both our TriTAC and ProTriTAC platforms and the underlying critical components of our product candidates. We currently hold worldwide rights to all of our product candidates. 
Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to harness innovations in immunotherapy and protein engineering to rapidly advance our novel TriTAC product candidates through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization, with an initial focus on cancer. This strategy encompasses the following key elements: 

• | Rapidly advance our TriTAC product candidates, HPN424 and HPN536, which target clinically validated tumor-associated antigens through clinical development and regulatory approval. We are developing our lead TriTAC product candidate, HPN424, to target PSMA for the treatment of prostate cancer. HPN424 is in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of mCRPC, and in January 2019 we announced preliminary data that supports the proposed mechanism of action of HPN424. We are developing our second TriTAC product candidate, HPN536, to target MSLN for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma and other MSLN-expressing solid tumors. Our IND for HPN536 took effect in January 2019, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in the first half of 2019. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly advance our other TriTAC product candidates into and through clinical development. Our TriTAC platform enables us to rapidly identify and develop pipeline product candidates. Our earlier stage TriTAC product candidates include HPN217, which targets BCMA for the treatment of multiple myeloma, and HPN328, which targets DLL3-for the treatment of SCLC. We expect to advance rapidly these programs into clinical development and to file INDs for these TriTAC product candidates in 2019 and 2020, respectively. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our novel TriTAC and ProTriTAC platforms to expand our pipeline of immunotherapy product candidates to target a broad range of disease associated antigens. Through our TriTAC and ProTriTAC platforms, we intend to address numerous targets that are difficult to treat with traditional therapeutic modalities due to safety and efficacy challenges. Current T cell engagers have had limited success in certain indications, but we believe we are transforming this modality into one that will address large unmet medical needs, initially by designing a class of therapeutics focused on solid tumors. We believe our proprietary TriTAC and ProTriTAC platforms enable us to rapidly move additional potential pipeline therapeutics into the clinic. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Selectively collaborate with leading biopharmaceutical companies to leverage our platform, advance our product candidates and maximize their commercial potential. We intend to retain significant ownership of our current pipeline product candidates and to partner and collaborate with leading biopharmaceutical companies on select programs such that we retain significant economic and commercial rights to our portfolio in the United States and certain other geographies. Through strategic collaborations, we believe we can broaden the reach of our TriTAC and ProTriTAC platforms to other novel targets in oncology or other areas that are not a focus for our company. For example, we entered into a collaboration with AbbVie in October 2017 that expands the utility for our TriTAC platform by developing candidates against novel soluble TCR targets.

Our TriTAC Platform 
 Our proprietary TriTAC platform offers the potential to develop drugs that could dramatically change the way in which we combat a variety of diseases. It is well accepted that the immune system can be harnessed to eradicate and prevent the proliferation of cancer cells. Recent successes using immunologic approaches have revealed methods of modulating a cancer patient’s immune system to battle the growth and spread of tumors. In most cases, T cells have been central to this approach, and the pathways to unleash the tumor-killing properties of T cells have resulted in multiple recent drug approvals. 
 We believe our TriTACs represent the evolution of a validated cancer-killing modality that engages T cells to kill tumors. The first approved T cell engager, a BiTE developed by Amgen and marketed as Blincyto, was approved in 2014 for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In April 2018, data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Conference demonstrated encouraging clinical responses with Amgen’s PSMA-targeting product candidate in mCRPC patients. More recently, data presented at the Myeloma 2018 and American Society of Hematology 2018 conferences demonstrated encouraging clinical responses to a BiTE targeting BCMA in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. With our TriTAC platform, we set out to design a T cell engager that incorporates the strengths of BiTEs (including small size and activity at low levels of antigen expression) and improves upon their critical shortcomings (including short half-life and limited stability). 
 We designed our TriTAC product candidates with three primary components: a CD3 binding domain for T cell engagement, a proprietary half-life extension domain and an antigen-bonding domain. TriTACs consist of a single-chain polypeptide designed to bind to a cancer surface antigen, human serum albumin and the CD3 epsilon subunit of the TCR. Tumor-targeting and albumin-binding are achieved by single domain antibodies, or sdAbs, while CD3 is bound by a single-chain variable fragment, or scFv. When TriTACs simultaneously bind cell surface antigens and T cells, they induce the formation of a cytolytic synapse that mimics the natural interaction between TCRs and MHCs. This interaction activates T cells to kill target cells, as demonstrated in the figure below.

We believe our TriTAC platform offers the following features for the discovery and development of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of a wide array of diseases, including cancer: 
  
• | Active at Low Levels of Target Expression. We designed TriTACs to be active at low levels of antigen expression where other treatment modalities lose efficacy. Tumors often utilize an escape mechanism involving the downregulation of target antigen expression to avoid immuno-surveillance. In our preclinical studies, TriTACs did not require high levels of target antigen expression to engage T cells to kill disease cells. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MHC Independence. We designed TriTACs to specifically direct T cells to kill target cells independent of MHC expression. T cells recognize target cells naturally through binding to an antigen-derived peptide complexed with MHC on the target cell. The reduction of MHC expression is a frequent mechanism by which cancer cells escape T cell recognition. We believe that because TriTACs do not require a T cell clone with specific T cell receptor or MHC recognition to kill tumor cells, they will be able to generate greater and more durable therapeutic responses than MHC dependent approaches. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extended Half-Life and Stability. We designed TriTACs to have a long-serum half-life in order to achieve efficacy without requiring continuous IV administration, which is a limiting requirement of other T cell engagers such as BiTEs. Our TriTACs utilize noncovalent binding to serum albumin, which has been validated as an effective way to extend the serum half-life of other proteins for up to several weeks. We also designed TriTACs as single-chain polypeptides that incorporate antibody fragments called sdAbs to improve their stability under physiological conditions. The stability of the molecule is critical to how long it can circulate within the body and remain effective. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Small Size and Tissue Penetration. We believe the small size of our TriTACs enables effective solid tumor penetration. Despite having three binding domains, a TriTAC is only about one third of the size of a monoclonal antibody and similar in size to BiTEs, which have recently shown clinical promise in the treatment of solid tumors. We believe this small size allows for faster diffusion into human tumor tissues than is possible with full-length antibodies given the high interstitial pressure and dense extracellular matrix in solid tumors. To achieve the same level of tumor penetration, larger modalities require higher concentrations on the periphery, which can lead to increased off-target toxicity and a limited therapeutic window. We believe TriTACs’ small size is critical for their penetration of tumors and, ultimately, for clinical efficacy. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Modularity. We designed the TriTAC construct to be able to easily switch out target antigen binding domains. We believe this modularity will allow us to rapidly expand into new indications in oncology and other therapeutic areas upon the successful generation of binders for disease-specific target antigens. We expect to have four TriTAC product candidates in clinical development by the end of 2020. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety Design Elements. We designed TriTACs to enable T cell engagement while minimizing off-target toxicity and the potential for CRS. Safety design elements of our TriTACs include the following: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | No Fc Domain. TriTACs do not use the Fc domain of an antibody for half-life extension, as compared to other half-life extended T cell engagers. Fc receptor binding can lead to unintended target activation of T cells and off-target toxicity. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | sdAb Fragments. TriTACs utilize sdAb fragments, which are very stable domains, for target binding and half-life extension. In contrast, other T cell engagers rely more heavily on scFv antibody fragments, which are prone to aggregate and activate T cells non-specifically, potentially leading to off-target toxicity. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Monovalent for CD3. Because TriTACs have a single anti-CD3 domain, TriTACs are monovalent for CD3. As a result, TriTACs cannot cluster CD3 and activate T cells non-specifically in the absence of target engagement, reducing the likelihood of unintended T cell activation and off-target toxicity. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conventional Manufacturing. We designed TriTACs as highly potent and stable yet flexible single-chain polypeptides engineered to use conventional antibody manufacturing approaches. TriTACs are “off-the-shelf” therapies, the manufacturing of which is significantly less complex than that of personalized or cell-based therapies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical Validation of our TriTAC Platform 
 In validation of our TriTAC platform, we have demonstrated that our TriTACs can induce T cells to kill tumor cells in both cell-based and animal models.

The figure below shows data from a cell-based experiment in which resting T cells from a healthy human donor were incubated together with the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. In this experiment, we compared our PSMA-targeting TriTAC with a PSMA-targeting BiTE molecule that we manufactured internally based on protein sequences published by Amgen. We observed our PSMA-targeting TriTAC to be more potent than the comparative molecule. 
 


Our TriTACs have also demonstrated high potency in animals. The figure below shows data from a xenograft experiment in which mice bearing human colon cancer tumors derived from the HCT116 cell line were dosed with epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, targeting TriTACs. We observed that EGFR-targeting TriTACs controlled tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner.

To demonstrate that our TriTAC design can extend the half-life of our product candidates as compared to BiTEs, we performed pharmacokinetic studies in animals. As shown in the figure below, when administered by short IV bolus infusion of 0.1 mg/kg, TriTACs were observed to have a terminal half-life of over 80 hours, compared to less than two hours reported in the literature for Blincyto. We believe we can administer once-weekly dosing and overcome one of the major limitations of BiTEs, which is the requirement of continuous IV infusion. 
 

Overall, we believe our preclinical data demonstrate that TriTACs are a novel modality that is well-suited for development as potential treatments for solid tumors. 
 Our TriTAC Product Candidates 
 HPN424: PSMA-targeting TriTAC 
 We are developing our lead TriTAC product candidate, HPN424, for the treatment of prostate cancer. Our IND for HPN424 took effect in July 2018 and we treated the first patient in our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of HPN424 for the treatment of mCRPC in August 2018. HPN424 targets PSMA, a protein for which expression is largely restricted to both normal and malignant prostate-derived cells. HPN424 provides a differentiated mechanism of action compared to the current standard of care, as this targeted approach is designed to safely engage and direct T cells to kill cancer cells. In April 2018, data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Conference demonstrated the encouraging clinical responses of Amgen’s BiTE targeting PSMA in mCRPC patients. However, this product candidate, AMG212, requires continuous IV infusion, which could limit its adoption and accessibility. We believe HPN424 has the potential to move into earlier lines of therapy for prostate cancer. 
 In January 2019, we announced preliminary data from seven patients who had been enrolled in our Phase 1 clinical trial of HPN424, our lead TriTAC product candidate, as of December 31, 2018, which preliminary data supports the proposed mechanism of action of HPN424. Safety and tolerability are the primary objectives of the trial, and as of December 31, 2018, all seven patients remained on the study with weekly treatments of HPN424 with no dose limiting toxicities have been observed. Our secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as preliminary potential anti-tumor activity and biomarker data. The clinical trial results to date indicate that HPN424 serum exposure supports weekly dosing, and we observed changes in blood-derived tumor cell and serum biomarkers consistent with T cell activation. We expect to provide additional preliminary data from this clinical trial at a medical conference in the second half of 2019. 
 Market Opportunity 
 The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute, or SEER, estimates that there will be over 164,000 new diagnoses and over 29,000 deaths as a result of prostate cancer in the United States in 2018. Prostate cancer is expected to have the second highest incidence rate in 2018 and the third highest mortality rate in 2018, and is the second leading cause of male cancer death in the United States.

While the five-year survival rate of local and regional prostate cancer is nearly 100%, more aggressive forms of the disease, of which approximately 23% are initially diagnosed, have a five-year survival rate of approximately 30%. While these more aggressive forms of prostate cancer can initially be treated, nearly all of these patients experience a recurrence in tumor growth that results in the subsequent development of mCRPC. Nearly all prostate cancer-specific deaths occur after patients develop mCRPC, for which the median overall survival period is only 13 months. Later-generation anti-androgen drugs such as Johnson & Johnson’s Zytiga and Pfizer’s/Astellas’ Xtandi have widely become the standard of care and generated combined global sales of over $5 billion in 2017. There is a significant need for treatments that offer a novel mechanism of action with the potential to modify or cure the disease. 
 Preclinical Data 
 To demonstrate the potency and specificity of HPN424, a T cell-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or TDCC, assay was used to evaluate its in vitro potency in a panel of PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cell lines. The specificity was observed by the lack of killing in a control (non-PSMA binding) TriTAC on PSMA-positive cell lines and HPN424 on PSMA-negative cell lines. The figure below shows a representative TDCC assay result where HPN424, but not the control TriTAC, mediated the killing of the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. 
 

11


The in vivo antitumor activity of HPN424 was evaluated using a subcutaneous xenograft tumor model in an immuno-deficient mouse co-implanted with the 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs. As depicted in the figure below, HPN424 completely suppressed the growth of the prostate cancer cells at doses of 2 µg/kg/day and higher. 
 

Clinical Development Plan 
 In August 2018, we initiated a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label dose escalation and dose expansion trial of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of HPN424 in mCRPC patients. Eligible patients must have mCRPC, have received at least two prior treatment regiments for mCRPC and have evidence of disease progression on the most recent systemic treatment regimen. We expect to enroll approximately 40 patients in the trial, with approximately 20 patients in each of the dose escalation and dose expansion phases. The dose escalation phase began with single patient cohorts but, as a result of the grade 3 adverse event described below, is now proceeding per protocol using a 3+3 design with dose cohorts that enroll three to six patients per cohort, starting with the fourth cohort. The dose escalation phase is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and a recommended Phase 2 dose. Once a recommended Phase 2 dose is determined, we will initiate the dose expansion phase. As of December 31, 2018, we had enrolled seven patients in the trial. Our primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability at increasing dose levels. Our secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as preliminary potential anti-tumor activity and biomarker data. 
Phase 1 Preliminary Results 
 As of December 31, 2018, we made the following preliminary Phase 1 trial observations: 
 Patient Treatment and Tolerability: Seven patients have been treated in the dose escalation portion of the trial at doses ranging from 1.3 to 24 ng/kg. All seven patients were treated previously with a second-generation anti-androgen therapy. All seven patients remain on study treatment, with the time on treatment ranging from one to more than 20 weeks, and the number of doses received ranging from one to 22 weekly treatments. Adverse events were consistent with the expected mechanism of action, with three patients reporting grade 2 rigors or fevers that were manageable. One patient from the fourth cohort experienced a grade 3 CRS event (rigors and hypotension), which resolved within eight hours of dosing. This patient was re-administered HPN424 consistent with protocol guidelines. The patient experienced no further reactions and continues to be enrolled in the study. All patients experiencing adverse events were successfully re-treated (the patient who had reported a grade 3 CRS event was given Dexamethasone prior to being re-treated) after one week without further complications. No dose limiting toxicities have been observed, with four dose levels tested. 
 12


Serum Drug Exposure: Preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis supports weekly dosing. We created a simulated model using the pharmacokinetic parameters from the patient treated with a dose of 12 ng/kg, including apparent volume of distribution, clearance rate and half-life. As depicted in the figure below, actual measurements of serum concentration of HPN424 in the trial closely correlated with the simulated model, and maximum serum concentration of HPN424 was found to be proportional to the dose. The volume of distribution and clearance rates appear to be similar among different dose levels suggesting linear pharmacokinetic properties. 
 

T Cell Engagement: Transient and dose-dependent increases in peripheral cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10) and chemokines (macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1-beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) were observed, consistent with the expected mechanism of action related to T cell activation. 
 Tumor Assessments: Radiographic assessment of disease burden is performed at nine-week intervals. For the first three patients in the trial, radiographic and PSA data have shown stable disease for two patients and one patient exhibited unconfirmed progressive disease. The other four patients are early in their treatment and not yet evaluable. The table below shows circulating tumor cell, or CTC, levels of patients treated with different doses of HPN424 over the course of the trial. As depicted in the table, whole blood samples from three of four patients with measurable baseline CTC levels showed a reduction in CTC following treatment with HPN424. 
 

HPN536: MSLN-Targeting TriTAC 
 We are developing HPN536 for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other MSLN-expressing tumors, which include mesothelioma, pancreatic carcinoma, NSCLC and TNBC, among others. HPN536 targets MSLN, a cell-surface protein whose normal expression is largely restricted to mesothelial cell layers lining certain organs. MSLN is an attractive drug target for target-based therapeutics because it is expressed on a wide variety of tumor cells but has limited expression in normal tissue. Early signs of clinical efficacy generated by other treatment modalities have validated MSLN as an attractive tumor target, but therapies with improved efficacy are required to treat MSLN-expressing tumors. In 2018, we completed an IND-enabling, multi-dose GLP toxicology study in animals. HPN536, which has been observed to bind to cynomolgus monkey MSLN with comparable affinities as human MSLN, delivered clear histological evidence of target engagement. Our IND for HPN536 took effect in January 2019, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in the first half of 2019.

Market Opportunity 
 MSLN-expressing tumors include ovarian cancer, NSCLC, pancreatic carcinoma, mesothelioma and TNBC, among others. While MSLN is found in approximately 30% of all cancers, these specific cancers have particularly high levels of MSLN expression. The following table shows the MSLN expression level of, and the number of patients diagnosed in the United States in 2018 with, each of these cancers: 

Cancer Type | New Patients Diagnosed in the United States | | | MSLN Expression Level (%)
------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+---------+----+--------------------------
Ovarian Cancer | | 22,000 | | | 60-65 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer | | 199,000 | | | 60-65 *
Pancreatic Carcinoma | | 55,000 | | | 80-85 
Mesothelioma | | 2,600 | | | 85-90 
Triple Negative Breast Cancer | | 40,000 | ** | | 34-42 


* | Represents MSLN expression levels across all lung cancer types.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


** | Calculated as 15% of SEER-estimated breast cancer incidence.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------

 Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the United States and is the deadliest of gynecologic cancers with more than 70% of patients diagnosed with an advanced stage and over 14,000 patients dying from the disease each year. According to SEER, the five-year survival rate for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer is approximately 47%. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, estimated to comprise 80-85% of all lung cancer diagnoses. The five-year survival rate for late-stage NSCLC is about 10%. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most fatal cancers in the world. In 2016, the seven major markets (the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan) saw 149,780 new cases of pancreatic cancer and in 2018, there were approximately 55,440 new cases in the United States. SEER estimates that fewer than 9% of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survive five years. Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer that affects the lining or membrane that covers and protects certain organs in the body. Effective treatment options for patients with mesothelioma are very limited. TNBC is referred to as “triple-negative” because it is ER-, PR- and HER2-, and is unlikely respond to hormonal or HER2-targeted therapies. TNBC accounts for 10-20% of all breast cancers and is more aggressive and likely to recur compared to receptor-positive breast cancers. The five-year survival rate for TNBC is 77% as compared to 93% for other types of breast cancers. 
 Preclinical Data 
 To demonstrate the in vitro potency and specificity of HPN536, we used TDCC assays in a panel of MSLN-expressing ovarian cancer cell lines. The specificity was observed by the lack of killing by the control TriTAC on MSLN-positive cell lines and by the lack of killing by HPN536 on MSLN-negative cell lines. The figure below shows a representative TDCC assay result where HPN536, but not the control TriTAC, mediated killing of the ovarian cancer cell line (Caov-3).

A subcutaneous xenograft tumor model with the H292 cell line was used to evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity of HPN536 in MSLN-expressing lung cancer cell lines co-implanted with human PBMCs. The mice were dosed once-daily beginning on day six for ten days. As depicted in the figure below, HPN536 had a significant effect on tumor growth at doses of 0.1 mg/kg and higher. 
 


Clinical Development Plan 
 We submitted our IND in December 2018, which took effect in January 2019. We intend to initiate a Phase 1/2a open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary clinical activity of HPN536, initially recruiting patients with ovarian cancer who have failed standard available therapy. We expect to enroll approximately 20 platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer patients in the dose escalation phase, which is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and a recommended Phase 2 dose. Once a recommended Phase 2 dose is determined, we expect to initiate the dose expansion phase with three parallel 20-patient cohorts, conducted according to a Simon 2-stage design. The cohorts will be indication-specific, and we expect to enroll patients with ovarian cancer, mesothelioma and pancreatic carcinoma. 
 HPN217: BCMA-Targeting TriTAC 
 We are developing HPN217 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. HPN217 targets BCMA, a clinically validated target. BCMA is a tumor necrosis factor receptor super family member and is a receptor protein expressed on nearly all multiple myeloma cells. Early data from CAR-T and ADC have clinically validated the target. Recently, data presented at the ASH 2018 Annual Meeting demonstrated encouraging clinical responses to a BiTE targeting BCMA in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. A complete response or stringent complete response was observed in seven patients with a response duration up to eight cycles (48 weeks). Of these seven patients, six were treated with the dose level ³100 µg/d. Further, five of the seven patients achieved a stringent complete response and were negative for minimal residual disease. We believe this demonstrates early promise of BCMA-targeting T cell engagers to overcome the limitations of other modalities to achieve superior efficacy and safety. We are currently conducting IND-enabling studies and expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of HPN217 in the second half of 2019. 
 Market Opportunity 
 Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer formed by the accumulation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow, crowding out normal plasma cells that play an important role in the immune system. Multiple myeloma is the second most prevalent blood cancer after Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. There are approximately 229,000 people living with myeloma worldwide, with 114,000 new cases diagnosed and 87,000 deaths each year. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 30,700 new cases will be diagnosed and approximately 12,770 deaths are expected to occur from multiple myeloma in the United States in 2018. Despite advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma over the past decade, we believe there remains a significant unmet need as the five-year survival rate is only approximately 50%. 
 15


Preclinical Data 
 To demonstrate the in vitro potency and specificity of HPN217, we used TDCC assays in a panel of BCMA-expressing cell lines derived from multiple myeloma or lymphoma patients. The specificity was observed by the lack of killing by the control TriTAC on BCMA-positive cell lines and by the lack of killing by HPN217 on BCMA-negative cell lines. The figure below shows a representative TDCC assay result where HPN217, but not the control TriTAC, mediated killing of the NCI-H929 multiple myeloma cell line. 


Subcutaneous xenograft tumor models (RPMI8226) involving BCMA-expressing multiple myeloma or lymphoma cell lines co-implanted with human PBMCs were used to evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity of HPN217. The mice were dosed once daily beginning seven days after tumor implantation. As depicted in the figure below, HPN217 had a significant effect on tumor growth at doses of 0.05 mg/kg and higher. At 0.5 mg/kg, HPN217 induced complete tumor regression and suppression of tumor growth. 
 

HPN328: DLL3-Targeting TriTAC
 We are developing HPN328 for the treatment of SCLC. DLL3 is a protein highly expressed in a majority of SCLC tumors and cancer stem cells, but not expressed in normal tissue. This selective expression makes DLL3 an attractive drug target for T cell engagers. We are currently conducting IND-enabling studies and expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of HPN328 in 2020.
 16


Market Opportunity 
 Approximately 30,000 patients are diagnosed with SCLC annually in the United States, representing 10-15% of lung cancer diagnoses. The five-year relative survival rate for patients with Stage I, II, III and IV SCLC is approximately 31%, 19%, 8% and 2%, respectively. The recent approval of Opdivo, a T cell-targeting checkpoint inhibitor developed by BMS, supports immunotherapy as a new treatment alternative for SCLC. We believe there is still a significant unmet need remains for new therapies for these patients. 
 ProTriTAC—An Expansion of TriTAC’s Capabilities 
 In order to expand the universe of addressable targets and indications, we are actively developing our proprietary ProTriTAC platform. Our ProTriTAC platform applies a prodrug concept to create a therapeutic T cell engager that remains inactive until it reaches the tumor. ProTriTACs therefore have the potential for additional tumor specificity and enhanced safety profiles because they are designed to have limited interaction with their molecular targets in healthy tissue, allowing us to target tumor-associated antigens that may be more broadly expressed. When a ProTriTAC penetrates a tumor, tumor-associated proteases cleave off the blocking domain of the ProTriTAC, thereby enabling the engagement of T cells to subsequently kill tumor cells. This activation process also diminishes the half-life of the resulting T cell engager so active molecules that leave the tumor are rapidly eliminated from circulation without causing off-tissue side effects. 
 


License and Collaboration Agreements 
 Collaboration Agreement with AbbVie Biotechnology 
 On October 10, 2017, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with AbbVie. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we granted to AbbVie worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products that incorporate our proprietary TriTAC technology together with soluble TCRs provided by AbbVie that bind to targets accepted by the parties. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, AbbVie is allowed to designate up to two targets, subject to confirmation of target availability. During a period of up to four years following the date of AbbVie’s designation of each target for the products, and confirmation of target availability, we and AbbVie will conduct certain research and discovery activities under a mutually agreed discovery and research plan in connection with the creation and evaluation of constructs comprising our proprietary TriTAC technology in conjunction with the soluble TCR sequences directed at the agreed upon targets of interest. We may not, by ourselves or through any third party, develop or commercialize any competing product that binds to any of the included targets. Following the discovery phase, AbbVie will be solely responsible, at its cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of the products that arise from the activities under the discovery plan. AbbVie is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one such product directed to each target for which the discovery activities were completed, in the United States and specified European markets. 
 In addition to an upfront payment of $17.0 million, AbbVie will be required to make further payments to us of up to $600.0 million in the aggregate, for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sale milestones for licensed products indicated for human therapeutic or prophylactic use, if such licensed products are successfully progressed against all included targets and indications. We will also receive tiered royalties on net sales by AbbVie, its affiliates and sublicensees of licensed products at percentages in the mid-single digits, subject to specified offsets and reductions. If licensed products are developed and commercialized for diagnostic or veterinary use, or certain screening or monitoring uses, the parties have agreed to negotiate an appropriate reduction in the economic terms applicable to such non-therapeutic and prophylactic applications. 
 17


The Collaboration Agreement will terminate upon the date of the expiration of all AbbVie’s royalty payment obligations in all countries. The Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by either party immediately for the insolvency of the other party or on 90 days’ written notice for an uncured material breach of the Collaboration Agreement by the other party. In the case of a material breach with respect to commercialization diligence with respect to any major market, or with respect to only one of the included targets, we may terminate the Collaboration Agreement solely with respect to the affected major markets, or target, as applicable. AbbVie may also terminate the Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a target-by-target or country-by-country basis for any reason on 30 days’ written notice to us. In addition, AbbVie may terminate the Collaboration Agreement immediately in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis if AbbVie considers in good faith that there has been a failure of the discovery or development efforts with respect to such target, or that further development or commercialization of products directed to such target is not advisable as a result of a serious safety issue. 
 Asset Transfer Agreement with Maverick Therapeutics, Inc. 
 In December 2016, we entered into an asset transfer agreement, or the Asset Transfer Agreement, with Maverick Therapeutics, Inc., or Maverick. Under the Asset Transfer Agreement, we transferred one provisional patent application (and any subsequently filed patent applications that claim priority to the provisional patent application) and certain know-how to Maverick solely for use in connection with a specific type of conditionally active T cell engagers having an activation mechanism that we believe is not used by the T cell engagers that are incorporated in the products that we are developing (such permitted use by Maverick, the Maverick Field), and Maverick assumed liabilities from us relating to this transferred intellectual property and other transferred assets. Maverick granted back to us a royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicenseable license under this transferred intellectual property for use in all fields outside of the Maverick Field, which include all fields in which we are developing products. We further granted Maverick royalty-free, exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to certain other patents that we own, in all cases solely for use in the Maverick Field. In consideration for our transfer and license of such intellectual property, Maverick issued a promissory note to us in the amount of $6.8 million, which we collected in full in January 2017, and all of its outstanding capital stock to us and this stock was distributed to our stockholders (such distribution, the “Distribution”). The Asset Transfer Agreement includes a covenant not to compete, which provides that we will not directly or indirectly research, develop, manufacture or commercialize products in the Maverick Field for four years after the Distribution. The Asset Transfer Agreement is not terminable and all rights transferred or licensed by a party to the other party under the Asset Transfer Agreement are irrevocable. For more information about the distribution of Maverick, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations—Asset Transfer Agreement with Maverick Therapeutics, Inc.” 
 On November 25, 2018, we received a letter from Maverick’s counsel alleging that our ProTriTAC program, as described in a poster we presented at a recent conference, is in the Maverick Field and, accordingly, is subject to the non-compete provision of the Asset Transfer Agreement. The letter demands that we assign to Maverick any patent applications we filed on our ProTriTAC technology, to the extent any such applications are related exclusively to the Maverick Field, and that we immediately cease any and all work on any molecules within the Maverick Field. On January 3, 2019, Maverick filed a complaint against us in the Delaware Court of Chancery and a motion for a temporary restraining order seeking to prohibit us from further developing our ProTriTAC platform. The complaint alleges various claims, including for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets, and seeks as relief, among other things, a declaration that our ProTriTAC technology impermissibly competes in the Maverick Field, a preliminary and permanent injunction and unspecified damages. On January 18, 2019, the Court denied Maverick’s motion for a temporary restraining order. We believe that the mechanism of action employed by our ProTriTAC platform falls outside the Maverick Field. We will vigorously defend the claims asserted against us. 
 Agreements with AGC Biologics, Inc. 
 In October 2015, we entered into the AGC License Agreement with AGC, pursuant to which AGC granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license under its proprietary Chinese hamster EF-1 protein expression technology, or the CHEF1 Technology, which is used in connection with the manufacturing process for HPN424, HPN536 and our other current preclinical product candidates, or collectively, the Products, for use in connection with our development of the Products, including our clinical trials. Subsequently, in July 2016, we entered into a development and manufacturing services agreement with AGC, or the Manufacturing Agreement, under which AGC conducts cGMP manufacturing of the Products utilizing the CHEF1 Technology. Under the terms of the AGC License Agreement, we have an option, exercisable for each Product, to be granted a non-exclusive license to use the CHEF1 Technology in connection with the commercialization of such Product for human therapeutics or diagnostics. If we exercise such option during a specified period, we will make a one-time upfront payment in the mid tens of thousands of dollars to AGC (solely in connection with the first Product) for such commercial license for the first Product, or if we exercise such commercial option after the expiration of such period, our commercial license will be subject to the payment of a higher option exercise fee. 
 18


We retain the right, at any time, to manufacture the Products using the CHEF1 Technology ourselves, or through an affiliate or third party manufacturer for development purposes, and subject to exercising our commercial option, for commercialization purposes. 
 Under the terms of our agreements with AGC, so long as AGC is the exclusive manufacturer of our Products, we will not owe AGC any milestone or royalty payments to AGC under the AGC License Agreement for the use of the CHEF1 Technology. However, if AGC is no longer our exclusive manufacturer for the Products, and we still use the CHEF1 Technology, we will owe AGC specified development and regulatory milestones of up to $350,000 per Product, and a royalty on net sales of Products of less than 1%, payable for the longer of ten years from first commercial sale of such Product, or the expiration of the patent rights in the CHEF1 Technology covering such Product in the relevant country, subject to a reduction in the event of no patent coverage. If we are not using AGC as our exclusive manufacturer of a given Product, such that we owe a royalty to AGC, we have an option, exercisable at any time prior to the end of the first royalty period in which a royalty is due for such Product, to buy out our royalty obligations in lieu of an ongoing royalty payment, by making a one-time payment to AGC in a dollar amount in the mid-single digit millions. 
 The Manufacturing Agreement can be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, or in the event of insolvency. We have the right to terminate the Manufacturing Agreement or any portion of the services at any time on 60 business days’ notice, and AGC has the right to terminate the agreement on 60 business days’ notice if it reasonably concludes that the services are not scientifically or technically feasible despite its commercially reasonable efforts and after we and AGC attempt to resolve the scientific or technical problem in good faith. The AGC License Agreement expires on the later of the expiration of all licensed patents or our use of trade secrets relating to the CHEF1 Technology or manufacture of Products. The AGC License Agreement terminates immediately in the event of either party’s insolvency, and AGC may terminate the AGC License Agreement for our material breach on 30 days’ notice to us. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any GMP manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, our commercial products. We believe this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of new product candidates. 
 To date, we have obtained bulk drug substance, or BDS, for HPN424 and HPN536 from a single-source third-party contract manufacturer, AGC. While any reduction or halt in supply of BDS from this contract manufacturer could limit our ability to develop our product candidates until a replacement contract manufacturer is found and qualified, we believe that we have sufficient BDS to support our current clinical trial programs. We have obtained final drug product for these product candidates from one of two engaged third-party contract manufacturers. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our product candidates and intend to put in place agreements under which our third-party contract manufacturers will generally provide us with necessary quantities of BDS and drug product on a project-by-project basis based on our development and commercial supply needs. 
 All of our TriTACs and ProTriTACs are manufactured from a vial of a master cell bank of that antibody’s production cell line. We have or intend to have one master cell bank for each TriTAC and ProTriTAC that was or will be produced and tested in accordance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, and applicable regulations. Each master cell bank is or will be stored in two independent locations, and we intend to produce working cell banks for each product candidate later in product development. It is possible that we could lose multiple cell banks from multiple locations and have our manufacturing severely impacted by the need to replace the cell banks. However, we believe we have adequate backup should any particular cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event. 
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with new immunotherapies that may become available in the future. 
 19


We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop immuno-oncology treatments. There are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche/Genentech. 
 We face significant competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that target specific tumor-associated antigens using immune cells or other cytotoxic modalities. These generally include immune cell redirecting therapeutics (e.g., T cell engagers), adoptive cellular therapies (e.g., CAR-Ts), antibody drug conjugates, targeted radiopharmaceuticals, targeted immunotoxin and targeted cancer vaccines. 
 With respect to our lead TriTAC product candidate, HPN424, we are aware of other competing PSMA-targeting clinical stage therapeutics, which include, but are not limited to: T cell engagers from Amgen Inc.; CAR-Ts from Poseida Therapeutics, Inc., Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. and Tmunity Therapeutics, Inc.; antibody drug conjugates from MedImmune LLC; and radiopharmaceuticals from Endocyte Inc./Novartis AG. 
 With respect to our second TriTAC product candidate, HPN536, we are aware of other competing MSLN-targeting clinical stage therapeutics, which include, but are not limited to: CAR-T from Novartis AG; antibody drug conjugates from Bayer AG and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; and other modalities from AbbVie Inc., Bayer AG and Selecta Biosciences Inc. 
 With respect to our earlier stage pipeline BCMA-targeting TriTAC product candidate HPN217, we are aware of other competing BCMA-targeting clinical stage therapeutics, which include, but are not limited to: T cell engagers from Amgen Inc., Pfizer Inc., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Celgene Corp. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; CAR-Ts from Autolus Therapeutics PLC, bluebird bio, Juno Therapeutics Inc./Celgene Corp., Gilead Sciences Inc., Legend Biotech/Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Novartis AG; antibody drug conjugates from GlaxoSmithKline PLC and AstraZeneca/MedImmune LLC; and other modalities from Affimed N.V. and Unum Therapeutics Inc./Seattle Genetics Inc. 
 With respect to our earlier stage pipeline DLL3-targeting TriTAC product candidate, HPN328 we are aware of other competing DLL3-targeting clinical stage therapeutics. These include, but are not limited to: T cell engagers from Amgen Inc.; CAR-T from Amgen Inc.; and antibody-drug conjugates from AbbVie Inc. 
 We are also currently developing a pipeline of ProTriTACs and other protease-activated therapeutics that face increasing competition from other biologic prodrug developers, which include, but are not limited to, Akrevia Therapeutics Inc., Amunix Operating Inc., Bayer AG, BioAtla, LLC, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., CytomX Therapeutics, Inc., Genentech, Inc., Nektar Therapeutics, Pandion Therapeutics, Inc., Revitope Oncology, Inc., Roche Holding AG and Seattle Genetics Inc. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, if required, the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Intellectual Property 
 The proprietary nature and protection of our platforms, product candidates and discovery programs, as well as our processes and know-how, are important to our business. We have sought patent protection in the United States and internationally for our TriTAC platform, binding domains and related TriTAC product candidates, as well as the proprietary technology in our ProTriTAC platform and any other inventions to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. For our product candidates, we generally pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of use and manufacture. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights in strategic areas, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We may also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. 
 20


To date, we have spent considerable effort securing intellectual property rights, including rights related to our TriTAC and ProTriTAC platforms, binding domains and specific targets pertaining to our product candidates. Below is a summary of how we view our protections and ongoing prosecution efforts. 
 TriTAC Platform 
 For our TriTAC platform, as of December 31, 2018 we own one patent family directed to composition-of-matter coverage and method of use of our core TriTAC platform technology. This family includes one issued U.S. patent, one U.S. non-provisional patent application and over ten foreign application counterparts. The issued patent in this family is projected to expire in 2036, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. 
 In addition to patent protection on our core TriTAC platform technology, as of December 31, 2018, we owned two patent families that relate to the CD3 and albumin binding domains of the TriTAC platform. Specifically, these two families are directed to composition-of-matter, method of use and sequence coverage to our anti-CD3 single-variable fragment, scFv, and anti-albumin single domain antibody, sdAb, binding domains. These patent families include three issued U.S. patents and over twenty foreign application counterparts. The issued patents in these two patent families are projected to expire in 2037, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. 
 HPN424 
 For our lead TriTAC product candidate, HPN424, as of December 31, 2018, we owned three patent families directed to composition-of-matter coverage of HPN424, its PSMA binding domain and related molecules, as well as methods of use for prostate cancer. These patent families include one non-expired U.S. provisional application, two U.S. non-provisional patent applications and two PCT international applications. Any patents issuing from these three patent families are projected to expire in 2037 and 2039, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. In addition to these three patent families, our patents on our core TriTAC platform technology and our anti-CD3 and albumin binding domains, provide additional patent coverage on HPN424. 
 HPN536 
 For our second TriTAC product candidate, HPN536, as of December 31, 2018, we owned two patent families directed to composition-of-matter coverage of HPN536, its MSLN-binding domain and related molecules, as well as methods of use for cancers. These patent families include two U.S. non-provisional patent applications and two PCT international applications. Any patents issuing from these two patent families are projected to expire in 2038, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. In addition to these two patent families, our patents on our core TriTAC platform technology and our anti-CD3 and albumin binding domains provide additional patent coverage on HPN536. 
 HPN217 
 For our pipeline BCMA-Targeting TriTAC product candidate HPN217, as of December 31, 2018, we owned two patent families directed to composition-of-matter coverage of HPN217, its BCMA binding domain and related molecules, as well as methods of use for cancers. These patent families include two U.S. non-provisional patent applications and two PCT international applications. Any patents issuing from these two patent families are projected to expire in 2038, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. In addition to these two patent families, our patents on our anti-CD3 and albumin binding domains provide additional patent coverage on HPN217. 
 HPN328 
 For our pipeline DLL3-targeting TriTAC, HPN328, as of December 31, 2018, we owned two patent families directed to composition-of-matter coverage of this TriTAC, its DLL3 binding domain and related molecules, as well as methods of use for cancers. These patent families include two non-expired U.S. provisional patent applications. Any patents issuing from these two patent families are projected to expire in 2039, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions. In addition to these two patent families, our patents on our anti-CD3 and albumin binding domains provide additional patent coverage on this TriTAC. 
 ProTriTAC Platform 
 Our patent portfolio for our ProTriTAC platform is at an early stage, with no issued patents as of December 31, 2018, and includes six patent families directed to composition-of-matter coverage of the ProTriTAC binding moieties, applications in various protein and cellular therapy formats and methods of use thereof. These patent families include eight non-expired U.S. provisional patent applications. Any patents issuing from these six patent families are projected to expire in 2039, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions.

On November 25, 2018, we received a letter from Maverick’s counsel alleging that our ProTriTAC program is subject to the non-compete provision of the Asset Transfer Agreement. The letter demands that we assign to Maverick any patent applications we filed on our ProTriTAC technology, to the extent any such applications are related exclusively to the Maverick Field, and that we immediately cease any and all work on any molecules within the Maverick Field (as defined in the Asset Transfer Agreement). On January 3, 2019, Maverick filed a complaint against us in the Delaware Court of Chancery and a motion for a temporary restraining order seeking to prohibit us from further developing our ProTriTAC platform. The complaint alleges various claims, including for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets and seeks as relief, among other things, a declaration that our ProTriTAC technology impermissibly competes in the Maverick Field, a preliminary and permanent injunction and unspecified damages. On January 18, 2019, the Court denied Maverick’s motion for a temporary restraining order. We believe that the mechanism of action employed by our ProTriTAC platform falls outside the Maverick Field. See “Business—License and Collaboration Agreements—Asset Transfer Agreement with Maverick Therapeutics, Inc.” We will vigorously defend the claims asserted against us. 
 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against any third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. While we plan to seek patent term extensions on any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted and, if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. We may therefore not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. 
 The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development, commercial strategies, drugs or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

Government Regulation 
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. 
U.S. Biologics Regulation 
 The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 In addition to the IND submission process, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules had historically been subject to review by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, Office of Biotechnology Activities, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. On August 17, 2018, the NIH issued a notice in the Federal Register and issued a public statement proposing changes to the oversight framework for gene therapy trials, including changes to the applicable NIH Guidelines to modify the roles and responsibilities of the RAC with respect to human clinical trials of gene therapy products, and requesting public comment on its proposed modifications. During the public comment period, which closes October 16, 2018, the NIH has announced that it will no longer accept new human gene transfer protocols for review as a part of the protocol registration process or convene the RAC to review individual clinical protocols. These trials will remain subject to the FDA’s oversight and other clinical trial regulations, and oversight at the local level will continue as set forth in the NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. 
 23


Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries. 
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
  
• | Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 BLA Submission and Review 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 24


After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
 A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. 
 Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review). 
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 25


In 2017, the FDA established a new regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. The RMAT designation program is intended to fulfill the 21st Century Cures Act requirement that the FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (i) the drug qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (ii) the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (iii) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Like breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. Once approved, when appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through: the submission of clinical evidence, preclinical studies, clinical trials, patient registries or other sources of real world evidence such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory datasets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval. 
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 26


The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Regulation of Diagnostic Tests 
 We expect that our drug candidates may require use of a diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations for our product candidates. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are medical devices, often in vitro devices, which provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for our drug candidates will utilize the PMA pathway. 
 PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 27


On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel drugs such as our drug candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. 
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity 
 The ACA includes a subtitle called the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, HIPAA and similar foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse, transparency and privacy laws. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including stock options. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration, such as consulting agreements, that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. 
 28


Civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. 
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearing houses and health plans, and individuals and entities that provide services on their behalf that involves individually identifiable health information, known as business associates, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
 The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product, if approved, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
 For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. 
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. No regulatory authority has granted approval for a personalized cancer immunotherapy based on a vaccine approach, and there is no model for reimbursement of this type of product.

Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. 
 The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, the Tax Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with ACA’s requirement to carry health insurance, known as the “individual mandate”, effective January 1, 2019. Since the enactment of the Tax Act, there have been additional amendments to certain provisions of the ACA. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional action is taken by Congress. 
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has already started the process of soliciting feedback on certain of these measures and, additionally, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. Although a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Additionally, the Right to Try Act, which was enacted on May 30, 2018, provides a federal framework for certain patients with life-threatening diseases to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
