Item 1. Description of Business
 
Historically we were previously an exploration stage mining company which transitioned into a bio-tech company in 2014. We currently have an IP Licensing Agreement in Germany, and the USA, with minimal monthly revenues to date. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully license our technology or that said licensing agreements will be commercially viable.
 
Our Address corporate address is #3 Bethesda Metro Center, Suite 700, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814; Telephone (877) 424-2429.
 
The company was previously engaged in the oil and gas exploration business. On April 29th, 2014, the company began a new direction and the majority of the Shareholders of the company elected the current Board of Directors and renamed the Company Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. The Directors formed a US based company founded in 2012 by a group of renowned researchers from the fields of molecular biology, cancer research and pharmacology. R&D is conducted in Government licensed labs in Israel with the focus of development of novel and sophisticated cannabinoid-based therapies, medications and administration routes for various diseases. 
History
 
Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. was incorporated on September 15, 2004, under the laws of the State of Nevada, as Thrust Energy Corp., for the purpose of acquiring undivided working interests in small oil and gas exploration properties and non-operating interests in both producing and exploration projects throughout the United States and Canada.
 
On September 30, 2010, we increased our authorized capital to 900 million shares of common stock (par value $0.0001) and 100 million shares of preferred stock (par value $0.0001), and effected a 20-for-1 reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse split, our issued and outstanding common stock was reduced from 13,604,000 shares to 680,202 shares and 5,000,000 preferred shares.
 
Due to our inability to earn any meaningful revenue from oil and gas exploration, our management determined in April 2011 that we should change our business plan to include toll milling and refining.
 
On May 5th, 2011, we effected a change of name to American Mining Corp. by completing a short form merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
On April 25th, 2014, Cannabics Inc., a Delaware Corporation, purchased 20,500,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company, thus acquiring control of the company.
 
On April 29th, 2014, Mr. Andrew Grundman resigned his official position as Director of the Corporation. On April 29th, 2014, the shareholders of the Corporation voted Dr. Zohar Koren, Dr. Eyal Ballan and Itamar Borochov as the new Directors of the Company.
 
Dr. Zohar Koren resigned his official position as director of the corporation on January 2015.
 
On June 3rd, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-to-one forward stock split of all outstanding shares of common stock. The stock split was approved by FINRA on June 19th, 2014. The effect of the stock split increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from 40,880,203 to 81,760,406. All common share and per common share data in these financial statements and related notes hereto have been retroactively adjusted to account for the effect of the stock split for all periods presented prior to June 3rd, 2014. The total number of authorized common shares and the par value thereof was not changed by the split.

Company’s Perspective -
 
Cannabics is a pioneer in the constellation of cannabis cancer and diagnostics. Our vision is to reveal and personalize the potential of cannabis medicine to treat cancer itself, as well as side effects. We develop cancer diagnostics in conjunction with cannabinoid medicine, utilizing novel bio-technological tools, striving to prevent cancer onset in healthy adults and progression in patients. Personalization of cannabinoid-based treatments is the main scope of the company, addressing the rapidly growing yet unmet need of cancer patients who are prescribed with cannabis. The multifactorial benefits of cannabis create an arising need that may unravel a new attitude to cancer treatment and prevention. The palliative aspects of cannabis such as reducing pain and nausea, propel the market to create OTC and pharma grade cannabis products to cancer patients. With minor side effects and no toxicity, the only barrier to millions of cancer patients is worldwide regulation. The legalization of cannabis worldwide is being generated both by medical and financial processes exposing and legitimizing cannabis consumption as a medical treatment. The number of cancer patients, caregivers and doctors that are exposed to cannabis is growing rapidly as new countries i.e. Germany, Canada, Australia and others adopt new regulations and introduce natural cannabis products to the health system. Since the palliative properties of cannabis as pain and nausea reduction are widely accepted by physicians, along with a growing body of clinical proof, and patient advocating these benefits; we believe that in next decade a large percentage of cancer patients worldwide will be treated with cannabis in varied medications both pharmaceutical and as nutraceutical. It is already scientifically proven that cannabinoids impact cell cycle though partially known biological mechanisms and impact many aspects of human biology and health. This unique situation in which a highly active compounds (i.e. THC, CBD) consumed by large portions of the population creates an unmet need to decipher the biological and clinical prospects of these compounds. Cannabics’ vision is to build a platform of data from which medications can be formulated, patients diagnosed and treated in a personalized manner. Our goal is to seek novel technologies in cancer medicine and assimilate them into cannabinoid medicine. The results we have gained in performing invitro studies and clinical studies are part of a growing holistic prospect of the treatment of cancer and other indications with cannabis. The still confining U.S. regulation creates an advantage for Cannabics which is specifically licensed to do such research and clinical studies by the Israeli Healthy Ministry. We have recently finished our first clinical study and leveraged our R&D lab to perform invitro tests and develop new formulations. As pioneers in this mission, we hope and believe that the database we create and the knowledge we gain will serve any cancer patient who is administered cannabis and will lead to better and more predictable outcomes.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
The Science
 
Cancer and Cannabinoids
 
Natural products have served as vital resources for cancer therapy (e.g.,Vinca alkaloids, paclitaxel, etc., which are used as conventional chemotherapeutic agents) and are also sources for novel drugs. Natural products from plants therefore represent an excellent resource for targeted therapies, as phytochemicals and herbal mixtures act multi-specifically, i.e. they attack multiple targets at the same time. Furthermore, the problem of drug resistance may be approached by integrating phytochemicals and phyto-therapy into academic western medicine through derivation and integration of data and as adjunct to conventional treatments. The integration of phytochemicals and phyto-therapy into cancer medicine represents a valuable asset to chemically synthesized chemicals and therapeutic antibodies. Cannabinoids are excellent candidates for this approach. Cannabinoids are a class of over 60 compounds derived from the plant cannabis sativa, as well as the synthetic or endogenous versions of these compounds. Cannabinoids show specific cytotoxicity against tumor cells, while protecting healthy tissue from apoptosis. These effects are exerted through cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 in mammals and through non-receptor signaling pathways. Recent studies suggest that cannabinoids contribute to maintaining balance in cell proliferation and that targeting the endo-cannabinoid system can affect growth of several different types of cancer, including gliomas, breast, colon, prostate, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
 
These dual anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of cannabinoids and associated signaling pathways have been investigated on a large panel of cancer cell lines. Cannabinoids also display potent anticancer activity against tumor xenografts, including tumors that express high resistance to standard chemotherapeutics. Several other studies have investigated the possible synergistic effects of cannabinoids with standard oncology therapies and are based on the pre-clinically confirmed concept of "cannabinoid sensitizers”. Cannabinoids have shown to enhance the efficacy of classical cytotoxic drugs at least in glioblastoma. However, additional studies are required to analyze the efficacy of these drug combinations in other cancer types as well as to identify additional cannabinoid-based drug combinations that could be useful for the treatment of cancer in general.

While many anecdotal reports by cancer patients using various formulations of Cannabinoids suggest significant efficacy, the lack of pure pharmacologically active compounds and legal restrictions have delayed the clinical research that will ultimately determine the level at which cannabinoids are effective in the treatment of cancer beyond their proven palliative effects. Thus, only few clinical trials have been conducted aiming to confirm the antineoplastic activity of cannabinoids. Further studies require extensive monitoring of the effects of cannabinoids alone or in combination with standard anticancer strategies. With such knowledge, cannabinoids could become a therapy of choice in contemporary oncology.
 
Furthermore, additional research will help lead to the development of cannabinoid-based therapies for the treatment of aggressive cancers and will also bring us closer to understanding the novel CB1- and CB2-independent component of the cannabinoid system that controls cancer progression.
 
For example, to date there has only been one clinical trial looking at the anti-tumor activity of cannabinoids on terminal human patients harboring actively growing recurrent gliomas.
 
Additionally, there are various in vitro studies elucidating the potential mechanism of action of cannabinoids for urological cancers, along with population-based studies specific for testicular malignancies. However, until now, no clinical trials have been conducted for urological cancer patients (bladder, kidney, prostate and testicles).
 
In a third example a study demonstrated the bladder cancer cell lines are regulated by activation of CB receptors where CB1 receptor activation played a more prominent role in proliferation, while CB2 receptors were more effective in triggering the pro-inflammatory state. Further research and more studies are required to understand the expression of these receptors in different stages of bladder cancers and also the varying effect of endocannabinoid ligands on the different CB1 and CB2 receptors.
 
Cannabinoids could provide unquestionable advantages compared to other current anti-tumor therapies: 
 
(1) Cannabinoids selectively affect tumor cells more than their non-transformed counterparts that might even be protected from cell death; 
 
(2) Selective inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation would be effective in those tissues where endo-cannabinoid levels are pathologically altered, without any significant psychotropic or immunosuppressive activity; 
 
(3) Cannabinoids could represent an efficacious therapy in COX-2-expressing tumors that have become resistant to induction of apoptosis: acting as COX-2-substrates with no effect on the protective properties of COX-2-derived products, they could offer some advantage with respect to the NSAID in order to enhance the sensibility to conventional anticancer therapies. 
 
The Palliative properties of Cannabis 
 
Cannabis has long been suggested to stimulate appetite, decrease nausea and vomiting, and improve quality of life in cancer patients. Studies on the efficacy of cannabis for improving CACS and S-NIS have had mixed results. After trials showing improvement in weight gain among AIDS patients, cannabinoids were tested on cancer patients as well. In a controlled, random study comparing dronabinol to a placebo among cancer patients, dronabinol was associated with increased appetite in 38% vs 8% for placebo, and decreased nausea in 20% vs 7%, using acceptable measurement scales. Of the dronabinol patients, 22% gained ≥2 kg, compared with 10.5% of placebo recipients, but this datum did not reach significance, perhaps due to the advanced stage of cancer and the high mortality in both placebo and experimental group.
 
Another randomized study compared dronabinol to megestrol acetate or both treatments together. The research included 469 advanced cancer patients who had been suffering from a substantial appetite loss. A greater percentage of megestrol acetate-treated patients reported appetite improvement compared with dronabinol-treated patients, 75% vs 49% (p=0.0001). Combination treatment resulted in no significant differences compared with megestrol acetate alone. Another study, which included 243 patients, compared the administration of a combination of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol to tetrahydrocannabinol alone, compared to placebo. It should be noted that cannabinoid dosages in the study were low, even in comparison to other studies. No significant differences between the groups were seen regarding improvement in appetite or weight-gain. In these two studies, no substantial side effects of cannabis products were found compared to the other arms. This may be related to the dosages of the drugs given.

A more recent study demonstrated improved chemosensory perception, appetite, sleep, and macronutrient preference in advanced cancer patients. However, the study included less than 50 patients. This research showed improvement in taste and smell perception in patients receiving chemotherapy, as well as appetite and caloric intake in the arm that received dronabinol compared to placebo.
 
Anti-Inflammatory Properties of Cannabis 
 
Over 50 compounds have been isolated from cannabis. Generally, cannabinoids refer to compounds that activate CB1 and CB2 or have structures similar to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC has been found to reduce inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Cannabidiol (CBD), the most abundant non-psychoactive cannabinoid, has also been studied for its anti-inflammatory properties. In synovial cells isolated from mice, CBD suppressed release of TNF-alpha. Cannaflavin A is 30x more potent than aspirin as an inhibitor of prostaglandin E2. There is some evidence that PGE2 is involved in cachexia, and the reduction of prostaglandin E2 via inhibition of COX-2 has been shown to improve lean muscle mass. Beta-caryophyllene and luteolin are two non-psychoactive, anti-inflammatory compounds found in cannabis and in other plants. Beta caryophyllene binds to CB2 and inhibits TNF alpha and IL-1b expression in human peripheral blood. Luteolin, a flavonoid found in celery and green pepper, has been found to suppress the production of TNFa, IL-1b, and IL-6 when added to peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro.
 
Personalized Medicine 
 
Despite significant progress in cancer diagnostics and development of novel therapeutic regimens, successful treatment of advanced forms of cancer is still a challenge and may require personalized therapeutic approaches. Our licensed Israeli facility operates a unique research and development laboratory which combines high throughput screening, (HTS) capabilities with the most advanced data tools. The HTS platform allows us to test many compounds on cancerous cell lines and tissues and measure the therapeutics effects of these compounds. Our advantage is in the specialized library which is composed of a collection of cannabis extracts and pure natural and synthetic cannabinoids. The library will also include a costumed cannabinoid matrix, to assess the possible interaction of combination therapy.
 
Advances in understanding many of the fundamental mechanisms of cancer progression have led to the development of molecular targeted therapies. While molecular targeted therapeutics continue to improve the outcome for cancer patients, tumor heterogeneity among patients, as well as intra-tumor heterogeneity, limits the efficacy of these drugs to specific patient subtypes, as well as contributing to relapse. Furthermore, Intra-tumor heterogeneity is caused by genomic instability in cancer cells, resulting in the selection of resistant clones, thus limits efficiency of cancer treatment. Thus, there is a need for a more personalized approach toward drug development and diagnosis that considers the diversity of cancer patients, as well as the complex milieu of tumor cells within a single patient. 
 
Personalized medicine refers to customization of treatment on the individual patient level, while Precision Medicine is a contemporary term that describes the utilization of molecular diagnostics to classify disease, and where possible, delivery of select treatment based on causal genetic variants. Current day molecular characterization of disease using next generation sequencing enables a sensitive and specific diagnosis established by genotype. Correlating essential genotype with disease-modifying genes, environmental influences, and individual polymorphisms may help explain variations in phenotype.
 
Precision cancer medicine relies on the possibility to match, in daily medical practice, detailed genomic profiles of a patient's disease with a portfolio of drugs targeted against tumor-specific alterations. Clinical blockade of oncogenes is effective but only transiently; an approach to monitor clonal evolution in patients and develop therapies that also evolve over time may result in improved therapeutic control and survival outcomes.
 
Our Research and Development:
 
To address these problems and improve clinical outcomes Cannabics focuses on the development of diagnostics that monitor cancer progression and cannabinoid-cancer sensitivity tests to tailor treatment of cancer with cannabinoid medicine. Utilizing novel High-Throughput Screening (HTS) methods to perform studies on cancer cell lines and on circulating tumor cells (CTC) derived from cannabis medicated patients.

We aim to treat a wide scope of cancers both as the main treatment and as a conjugate to conventional chemotherapy. We believe a significant need remains for novel oral and natural drugs for patients who do not respond to existing therapies or for whom these therapies bear undesirable side effects. We are currently exploring several formulations containing active compounds from the cannabis plant, including the psychoactive cannabinoid -THC and non-psychoactive cannabinoids - CBD, CBDA, THCA, THVC, CBN, CBG, CBGA and CBC. We recognize the potential therapeutic applications of the synergistic effects of these active compounds thus building the methodology and procedures that decipher specific ratios of active compounds in regard to their antitumor activity. Following successful research and development, we intend to license cannabinoid-based products and treatments that will be standardized in composition, formulation and dose, administered by means of an appropriate and efficient delivery system, and tested in properly controlled pre-clinical and clinical studies.
 
Our government licensed laboratory operates a unique, custom designed an built research and development laboratory which combines high throughput screening, (HTS) capabilities with the most advanced data tools allowing us to enable miniaturization and automation of a variety of biological assays. The automated system is comprised of:
 

1. | High Content Screening (HCS) Platform, which is an automated cellular imaging and analysis platform designed for quantitative microscopy.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Flow Cytometry, which enables multi-parametric single cell analysis.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Automated workstation, for liquid handling for dispensing accurate and reproducible volumes of liquids and compounds.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Multimode microplate reader, designed for fast measurements of numerous biological reactions/processes.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The integration of these instruments is enabled via a robotic arm, which allows a continuous process which utilizes all instruments.
 
Readouts generated from these instruments provide us with insights to the effect of our cannabinoid library on parameters such as, proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, angiogenesis prevention and toxicity on cancerous cells.
 
These experiments will produce multiplexed data composed of images of cells, cell specific markers and the extent/signal of the biological response. The biological response will be measured using different concentration of cannabinoids and their combinations, thus determining the most effective cannabinoid treatment for a specific cancer type.
 
Invitro Studies – Drug Screening 
 
We have a proprietary procedure of high throughput screening (HTS) and high content screening (HCS) for the detection of correlations between cannabinoid ratios, dosages and anti-tumor activity using a growing library of human cancer cell lines and creating an enlarged variety of Cannabis-based compounds. We examine the biological activity of these compounds on tumor cell lines of distinct tissue lineage and creating a highly valuable therapeutic data. We Screen for the most potent cannabinoid/natural extracts. Our goal in the invitro studies is to build a library of both purified and natural cannabinoid extracts and to reveal their biological impact on a library of cancer cell lines. The HTS technology enables us to gain this data base in a faster manner and to reveal more mechanisms of action that are related to the genetics of the cancer. We are now in the process of merging our data with sophisticated data mining to help find meaningful insights of both treatment and outcome.
Proof of Concept 
 
To date we have screened natural extracts mainly with high ratios of CBD, CBDA, THC, THCA which have clearly shown to cause apoptosis in various levels depending on compound and cancer type.
 
Currently we are in a process of enlarging our cancer cell library and our Cannabinoid library as our new GMP facilities are being approved in Israel, and are expected to supply a wide range of purified cannabinoids.

We believe that the preclinical data we collect will lead us to a designated formulation for specific cancers in order to ultimately approach the FDA.
 
Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs): 
 
Identifying Circulating Tumor Cells can be regarded as a “Liquid Biopsy of Cancer” method. CTCs can be useful for screening cancer drugs as they may reflect the severity and heterogeneity of primary tumors. CTCs are present in the blood of many patients with solid tumors. Most of these cells, which are thought to be involved in metastasis, die in the circulation, presumably due to the loss of matrix-derived survival signals or circulatory shear stress. The clinical value of CTCs as a biomarker for early cancer detection, diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, stratification, and pharmacodynamics have been widely explored in recent years. However, the clinical utility of current CTC tests is limited mainly due to methodological constraints. 
 
A full cancer genome and transcriptome is present in each individual CTC, therefore these cells represent an interesting source of tumor information where mutations and gene fusions can be found. Many studies have used enumeration of CTCs to predict recurrence or used cancer-derived biomarkers to follow therapy resistance.
 
CTC Testing and Cannabinoids 
 
We are currently in a process of commercializing a diagnostic test which is based on liquid biopsies of patients suffering from epithelial cancers.
 
Our proprietary test fuses two separate aspects which in fact complement each other:
 
1. Cell Count - The test uses CTC technology that marks and counts cancer cells from the blood sample. This test is a marker for cancer progression and treatment efficacy. It could be implemented as a follow up of disease progression while the patient is treated with Cannabis. We hypothesize that the accumulated data will eventually be a predictor for actual treatment outcome.
 
2. Cannabinoid Sensitivity Test. – This test counts number of live and dead cancer cells after been exposed to cannabinoid compounds such as THC or CBD and their combinations. As in the CTC count, after gaining multiple data sets and merging them with the expanding database; the test could better predict treatment outcome.
 
By providing personalized patient data, doctors will make better informed decisions about the cannabinoid treatment encompassing prioritized active compounds, dosages, treatment regime and follow up. These tests could be taken on a weekly/monthly basis, thus enabling treatment alteration due to cancer progression and biology. We have designed our own proprietary “big data” system specifically tailored for this, and these results will be submitted through a patient oriented, highly secure system. We have successfully standardized the procedure of high through output screening (HTS) for the detection of correlations between cannabinoid ratios, dosages and anti-tumor activity using a growing library of human cancer cell lines and creating an enlarged variety of Cannabis-based compounds. We examine the biological activity of these compounds on tumor cell lines of distinct tissue lineage, creating invaluable therapeutic data. We then screen the most potent cannabinoid/natural extracts with/without the conjunction of standard chemotherapy.
 
Proof of Concept 
 
We are currently working in collaboration with SIMFO GmbH, a renown German research laboratory on CTC drug sensitivity tests.
 
The CTC technology enables us to isolate cancer cells from blood samples and screen the effects of cannabinoids upon them. To date we have screened CBD, CBDA, THC, THCA and their combinations on CTC’s derived from breast, prostate and colon cancer patients. The results indicate a highly differentiated activity between cannabinoids and tumors. These preliminary results justify the more profound observation of the effects of different cannabinoids both from efficacy and toxicity aspects.
 
Personal effectiveness - checking the efficacy of dozens of cannabinoid compounds against the patient’s own tumor cells.

Genomics:
 
We are currently engaged in adding Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to our lab which will enable us to search for tumor mutations that have emerged as potential predictive markers of targeted therapy outcome to better understand their real clinical utility in identifying subsets of patients most likely to benefit from the administration of cannabis therapy.
 
Unmet need: Personalized medicine holds great promise for cancer treatment, with the potential to address challenges associated with drug sensitivity, drug resistance and inter-patient variability. Therapy approaches have so far been based on the characterization for tumors mainly by means of in situ tissue analyses (depicting disease as the sum of molecular alterations of a particular lesion at a definite time point). Furthermore, tumor heterogeneity is likely to be underestimated and insufficiently captured with single tumor-biopsy analysis. Similarly, single biomarker-driven therapy may not be adequate, suggesting that targeting ubiquitous gene alterations may lead to better cancer control and patient outcomes.
 
However, despite the vast knowledge gathering regarding tumor dynamics and genomics, still there exists the problem of tumor heterogeneity, as mentioned before, tumor heterogeneity among patients, as well as intra-tumor heterogeneity, variability among patients, and along the course for disease progression, challenges chemotherapy due to genetically and phenotypically different cell subpopulations and usually leads to drug-resistance by refractory tumors.
 
Additionally, despite the solid scientific evidences that cannabinoids exhibit a remarkable anticancer activity in preclinical models of cancer, the use of cannabis-based medicines in the clinical practice is restricted to palliative uses in a few diseases. Preclinical data accumulated during the last decade has stimulated the interest in developing additional clinical studies aimed at investigating the potential therapeutic value of these compounds in different diseases and specifically their potential as anticancer agents, however the number of active clinical trials is still very low.
 
Furthermore, although cannabis extracts are purely natural, and ignoring current US regulatory procedures, there is no conclusive evidence to support patient claims for starting on cannabinoid monotherapy (or combined therapy) for anticancer benefit even when all other avenues for therapy have failed. 
 
There is still a long felt unmet need to provide a validated system and method for selecting appropriate cannabis-based therapy grounded in evidence-based medicine, and this is exactly the core of where our company’s energies and focus lay. 
 
Clinical Studies 
 
Administration of Cannabis as a Palliative treatment 
 
The Science 
 
Cachexia
 
Cachexia originates from Greek and Latin roots: Kakos- (bad) and Hexis (condition or appearance). It is associated with several chronic diseases and, generally, involves a dual mechanism of general muscle wasting, malnutrition, and anorexia. Cachexia is primarily caused by cytokines released from inflammatory cells. In 2011, an international panel defined cachexia as a “multifactorial syndrome characterized by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment”.
 
Cachexia may be masked by excess weight, obesity, edema or tumor mass. Muscle wasting or sarcopenia occurs as a key feature of cachexia. In cachexia, muscle wasting is primarily caused by inflammation, in contrast to sarcopenia where muscle wasting is related to age and immobility. Additional parameters utilized to diagnose cachexia include food intake, CRP, and albumin levels. Studies on the efficacy of cannabis for improving CACS and S-NIS have had mixed results. After trials showing improvement in weight gain among AIDS patients, cannabinoids were tested on cancer patients as well. In a controlled, random study comparing dronabinol to a placebo among cancer patients, dronabinol was associated with increased appetite in 38% vs. 8% for placebo, and decreased nausea in 20% vs 7%, using acceptable measurement scales. Of the dronabinol patients, 22% gained ≥2 kg, compared with 10.5% of placebo recipients, but this datum did not reach significance, perhaps due to the advanced stage of cancer and the high mortality in both placebo and experimental group.

Anorexia and Cachexia 
 
Anorexia is a subjective term describing the reduction or loss of appetite. Although it is commonly known that patients suffering from cancer and cancer treatments experience loss of appetite, the exact prevalence of anorexia is unknown. In one study on advanced cancer patients, more than half the patients experienced anorexia.
 
In patients suffering from cancer, anorexia may be due to physiological and psychological factors. Anorexia can occur due to chemotherapy treatments, which cause nausea and vomiting. Tumors may also obstruct the upper gastrointestinal system, causing dysphagia and making it difficult to consume food. Depression also significantly contributes to decreased appetite. The decreased appetite causes increased psychological distress and a decreased quality of life.
 
The presence of a decreased appetite has been proposed to be an independent risk factor for mortality. A North Central Cancer Treatment Group study of 1,115 patients with colorectal and lung cancer found that patients with anorexia had lower survival rates and experienced more toxicity from chemotherapy than similarly matched patients who maintained their appetite. In a retrospective review of 3,047 patients by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology group, weight-loss greater than 5% before chemotherapy predicated early mortality regardless of stage or tumor type.
 
Cancer-Related Cachexia and Anorexia Syndrome 
 
Cachexia may occur with or without a loss of appetite or reduction in nutrition. Interestingly, anorexia or decreased appetite is an independent risk factor for patient decline and, therefore, it has been proposed to view anorexia accompanying cachexia as a separate syndrome. Cachexia primarily caused by anorexia or reduced intake has been defined as cancer-related cachexia and anorexia syndrome (CACS). CACS, unlike cachexia, includes weight-loss caused by muscle wasting, as well as lipolysis and decreased intake.
 
Pathogenesis of CACS 
 
Anorexia is due to both catabolic drivers and inflammation associated with cancer, side effects associated with chemotherapy and radiation, as well as depression and other psychosocial effects. It has been proposed that pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, may decrease leptin release by mimicking excessive negative feedback signaling from leptin. In addition, these cytokines also contribute to hyper-metabolism and increased resting energy expenditure, especially as patients near death.
 
The symptoms correlating with decreased appetite in cancer have been referred to as “secondary nutrition impact symptoms” (S-NIS), and include early satiety, constipation, nausea or vomiting, dysphagia and depression. Increasing protein and caloric intake, may increase body mass and prolong survival. In order to have this effect, it has been suggested that patients should increase caloric intake by 300-400kcal and protein intake by 50%. This was demonstrated in a study using parenteral nutrition, as meeting these goals may be difficult in patients experiencing S-NIS.
 
Decreased appetite may also lead to malnutrition. Although the relationship between malnutrition and cachexia is not well defined, it is proposed that a lack of certain nutrients further contributes to muscle catabolism, especially a deficiency of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, and choline. Treatments that address CACS should improve appetite in order to correct malnutrition associated with decreased protein and caloric intake.
 
CANNABICS SR 5MG capsules for CACS 
 
While the medicinal effects of certain cannabinoids are well known to physicians, it is common knowledge that smoking is hazardous to health. Many physicians are perfectly aware of the palliative properties of cannabis (i.e. antiemetic and analgesic), however they refrain from recommending or prescribing it to patients knowing that smoking the raw flowers is still the most common and available administration route. Hence the availability of an oral, standardized, reliable and clinically tested administration route of medical cannabis – no different from the administration route of most medications consumed by patients today - would dramatically improve the availability of medical cannabis therapy to patients in need.

We have developed a proprietary capsule as a treatment to improve cancer related cachexia/anorexia syndrome (“CACS”) in advanced cancer patients. The main purpose in the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and CACS is to gain weight and improve Quality of Life (“QoL”). We believe that QoL in patients with CACS is inversely related to reduced appetite and weight-loss.
 
Our clinical study was led by Professor Gil Bar-Sela, the Deputy Director of the Division of Oncology at Rambam Health Care Campus, Head of the Palliative and Supportive Oncology Unit, and Head of the service for Melanoma and Sarcoma Patients. The main endpoints of the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and CACS are weight gain and quality of life (QoL). The study is fully registered with the US NIH under "Cannabics Capsules as Treatment to Improve Cancer Related CACS in Advanced Cancer Patients", Identifier NCT02359123, and may be found at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02359123 . See our press release of July 3rd, 2018, updating information on this clinical study.
 
The Cancer Diagnosis Market
 
According to Grand View Research, Inc., the global cancer diagnostics market size was valued at USD 124.0 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at an annual rate of over 7%. This market is expected to reach USD 232.7 billion by 2025 according to Orbis Research.
 
The growth in cancer cases, growing demand for effective diagnostic tools that develop from rising awareness, government support and technological developments are driving the demand for this increase worldwide.
 
Cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide which leads to efforts to develop accurate diagnostic tools and effective treatment solutions. Early monitoring and pre-detection are being focused on as this leads to improved success rate in treatment. This leads to public awareness and healthcare support programs that promote routine check-ups which enable diagnosing the disease before first symptoms may appear.
 
According to BCC Research, the global market for circulating tumor cell (CTC) technology reached nearly $2.8 billion in 2012 and $3.7 billion in 2013. This market is estimated to reach nearly $8.9 billion by 2018, demonstrating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.9% for the five-year period, 2013 to 2018.
 
The major factors that affect the growth in this industry is due to increase advancements in biomedical imaging and bioengineering technology. Genomics development of methods that enhance detection, enumeration and analysis of CTC in patient samples will lead the estimated growth in the industry through to 2022.
 
The increasing adoption of personalized medicine and regular diagnostic tools creates the possibility of aggressively battling cancer in new and heretofore unthought of methods. This will create momentum and align interests to progress along these routes.
 
The growing demand for ongoing screening, diagnosis and monitoring throughout the different stages of the diseases development in order to assess the patient’s health will feed the growth of this sector in the coming years.
 
Personalized Cannabis Medicine - The Opportunity
 
Current changes in legislated cannabis legality and public support are creating a unique situation in which this highly potent drug is now being consumed by hundreds of millions of people seeking therapy in a wide spectrum of indications. One of the major groups are cancer patients who are mainly treated with chemotherapy or radiation, however, are now more exposed to the option of using cannabis for its palliative properties. This new industry permeates the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and food supplement markets and brings many different products i.e. high CBD/high THC, oral/sublingual, dosage and purity. However, doctors are still not educated to differentiate between strains/products and subscribe cannabis generally. Hence, the growing unmet need is to better understand the biology of cannabinoids and the clinical outcome of such products.
 
Cannabics is a pioneer in embedding invitro studies-diagnostics-clinical research and consumer data into a predictive and monitoring platform for cancer patients who require cannabis. 
 
Our Challenge is to harness novel technologies to study cancer with cannabinoids and to learn from our growing database to improve cannabinoid-based therapies.

Big Data and Predictive Analytics 
 
A key strategic component of our company in creating our new state-of-the art laboratory is in our understanding and usage of “Big Data”. The market for precision and personalized medicine is expected to grow by 10% per year in the next decade, made possible by a huge growth in the amount of high content screening data and advances in big data analytics. In contrast, the medical cannabis market is expected to grow by over 20% per year over the same period. This figure belies the fact that medical cannabis encompasses hundreds of strains, each with its own varied and complex chemical composition, leaving both medical practitioners and patients at a loss as to which strain or chemical mix is best suited to treat a given patient with a given disease. Cannabics aims to fill that void.
 
State-of-the-art data analytics are a key component of the novel platform developed by Cannabics in its efforts to enable practitioners to precisely tailor medical cannabinoid-based therapies to an individual patient's profile and cancer. Our proprietary platform employs cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and deep learning models to integrate large quantities of multi-omic profile, environment and lifestyle data into a high content drug sensitivity screening pipeline, enabling the development of highly personalized models that practitioners can rely on as preventative, primary and complementary cannabinoid-based treatment options.
 
In addition to the Cannabics predictive analytics and high content screening platform, Cannabics is also seeking partnerships and acquisitions that can address the acquisition, storage and security of personal health data related to medical cannabis consumption. The IoT market is slated to grow at over 20% per year over the next decade, while the global blockchain market is expected to grow at over 30% per year. The integration of both of these technologies will ensure that all patient related data, both multi-omic profiling and dosing records, are both accurate, immutable and secure. These benefits will help appease pubic concerns regarding the privacy of personal medical profiles, help overcome regulatory hurdles and ensure the integrity of a large portion of the data supporting Cannabics product and service offerings.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
Our success depends in significant part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our Product Prospects, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and to defend challenges and oppositions from others and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights, including our provisional patents described below.
 
We plan to continue to seek patent protection in the United States and other countries for our proprietary technologies. To date, our intellectual property portfolio includes three provisional patents, filed with the USPTO, related to our line of activity (pharmaceutical formulations; drug delivery; therapeutic uses of cannabinoids and other cannabis compounds and personalized cannabinoid diagnostics), as well as know-how and trade secrets.

Our policy is to seek patent protection for the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business, but only in those cases where we believe that the costs of obtaining patent protection is justified by the scientific and commercial potential of the technology, and typically only in those jurisdictions that we believe present significant commercial opportunities. We anticipate that we will file additional patent applications in conjunction with our research, testing, and development of our cannabis-based products.
 
Competitive Factors
 
The Pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and we will be competing with many other and better financed companies.
 
We are an early stage pharmaceutical company, with relatively deminimis cash flow. We compete with other early stage bio-tech and pharmaceutical companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in early stage development companies. The presence of competing early stage pharmaceutical companies may impact on our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our research and development if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on their subjective analysis of our company, the general market conditions and the price of the investment offered to investors.
