Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a leading enterprise software company enabling digital delivery of care for healthcare’s key stakeholders. We empower our clients with the core technology and services necessary to successfully develop and distribute virtual care programs that meet their strategic, operational, financial and clinical objectives under their own brands. The Amwell Platform is a complete digital care delivery solution that equips our health system, health plan, government, and innovator clients with the tools to enable new models of care for their patients and members. Our scalable technology integrates with our clients’ existing offerings and clinical workflows, spanning the continuum of care and enabling care delivery across a wide variety of clinical, retail, school and home settings. Our client-focused approach drives our success as one of the largest global digital healthcare enterprise software companies. As of December 31, 2021, we powered the digital care programs of over 55 health plans, which collectively represent more than 80 million covered lives, as well as approximately 150 of the nation’s largest health systems, encompassing more than 2,000 hospitals. Since inception, we have powered over 14.3 million telehealth visits for our clients, including more than 5.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 The Amwell Platform enables virtual and automated care delivery across the full healthcare continuum – from primary and urgent care in the home to high acuity specialty consults, such as telestroke and telepsychiatry, in the hospital. We support both on-demand and scheduled consultations and offer pre-packaged care modules and programs that power over 100 unique use cases today. The Amwell Platform can be fully integrated into our clients’ patient/member portals and provider workflows. Providers can launch telehealth directly from their native EHRs, with seamless integration to their payer eligibility and claims systems. Providers, patients and members can access this care through a full range of Carepoints™, including via mobile, web, phone and our proprietary carts that support multi-way video, phone or secure messaging interactions. Through our recent acquisitions of Conversa Health, Inc. (“Conversa”) and SilverCloud Health Holdings, Inc (“SilverCloud”) (together, the “August 2021 Acquisitions”), we enable automated care touchpoints, support ongoing treatment and care through digital engagements, and escalate care when needed to a live clinician. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 88,000 of our clients’ providers use the Amwell Platform to serve their patients and members. When needed, we augment and extend our clients’ clinical capabilities with Amwell Medical Group (“AMG”), a nationwide network of clinical entities with over 6,500 multi-disciplinary providers covering 50 states with 24/7/365 coverage. The AMG network includes a clinical entity with care capabilities that have been accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”) and a separate clinical entity with care capabilities accredited by the Joint Commission.
 Converge is the latest version of the Amwell Platform and is meant to be reliable, flexible, scalable, secure and fully integrated with other healthcare software systems. Converge offers state-of-the-art data architecture and video capabilities, flexibility and scalability, and a user experience designed around the needs of patients and providers. Converge has been designed from the ground up with the holistic understanding that the future care of any one patient will inevitably blend a mix of physical, digital, and automated experiences. The telehealth of today has grown to encompass hybrid care models, asynchronous and automated care, remote patient monitoring, patient and provider engagement — and the flow of data that drives all of the above.
 With Converge, the digital care capabilities that health systems and health plans care about — for example virtual primary care, post-discharge follow-up, chronic condition management, remote patient monitoring — are aligned into a single digital care operating system that aggregates all of the data from these care experiences to provide real-time insight. By providing a single platform for the digital distribution of care, Converge will accelerate innovation and interoperability for health system and health plan clients as well as other healthcare innovators, who aim to offer a seamless experience for providers, patients and members.
 Our Industry Opportunities 
 Healthcare today is inefficient, expensive, complicated and fragmented – resulting in substantial challenges for providers, health plans, and patients. By addressing these challenges, virtual care delivery offers many opportunities to improve healthcare, which include: 

• | Solving the Access Crisis Driven by Provider Shortages and Inefficient Resource Allocation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Addressing Increasing Healthcare Costs for All Key Stakeholders;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Promoting Greater Coordination of Care; and
--+--------------------------------------------

• | Optimizing Patient Experience to Drive Recruitment and Retention.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Solution 
 To capture these opportunities, we believe clients are seeking a comprehensive solution to support their connected care goals and consolidate unintegrated vendors and in-house designed solutions. 
One Platform, Powering the Care Continuum 
 The Amwell Platform is a scalable, secure software platform that supports a full range of virtual care functionality. Historically, Amwell has offered the Home line (provider-to-patient telehealth interactions, typically in the home), and the Hospital line (supporting provider-to-provider telehealth interactions, or provider-to-patient, typically in an inpatient or ambulatory setting). Converge brings these two lines together into a single and comprehensive enterprise software platform that is built to be more scalable, modular, embeddable, efficient, and capable. In particular, Converge enables the integration of asynchronous care pathways, such as text and data exchange, with synchronous care pathways such as live video calls. As of December 31, 2021, 53 Amwell clients have deployed Converge. Our Converge rollout began with the introduction of Amwell Now, which allows clients to connect easily with patients in the home or the hospital and continued as we added EHR embedding capabilities during 2021.  We expect that substantially all existing Amwell clients will be operating on Converge by the first half of 2023. 
 The Amwell Platform offers clients the ability to implement and quickly expand their virtual care offerings across many areas of clinical practice. Our Platform is a highly configurable, brandable infrastructure that enables clients to deliver virtual care under their own brands and with their own providers. We offer a full range of management software, clinical workflows, CarepointTM hardware and system integrations to deliver care across many modalities, including video, text, and phone. Our Platform is designed to support the continuum of care by offering the specific workflows and device solutions needed to deliver this care.
 Our open architecture allows the Amwell Platform to connect to existing systems, devices and access endpoints and to embed telehealth into our clients’ workflows. The Amwell Platform includes a broad set of APIs and embeddable software widgets that offer clients the ability to integrate, embed and customize virtual care across their digital domains, including: 
  
• | Patient access points such as white-labeled web and mobile apps, 24-hour nurse and customer support lines and customer applications, such as patient or member “digital front doors”;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provider access points, such as EHR systems, including Cerner, Epic and more. Clinicians can launch telehealth visits from within their EHRs, add records of new patients acquired via telehealth and share consult data through our bidirectional integrations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Administrative functions such as enrollment, clinical management, payment, eligibility and claims administration, e-prescribing, follow-up and data interchange; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to tap into all functions of the Amwell Network Operations Center (“NOC”) and Telehealth Operational Dashboard for all patient front doors and provider access points, ensuring seamless care delivery across owned providers and provider networks and affiliates for 24/7 load balancing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Amwell Platform is designed to quickly launch and remotely implement telehealth offerings for our clients and grow with them as they broaden their digital offerings through additional modules for a wide variety of use cases. Health systems typically begin with either urgent care or an acute use case, such as telestroke or telepsychiatry, and subsequently add modules for areas such as scheduled specialty follow-up visits, virtual rounding, school-based services and more. Health plans typically begin with an urgent care or virtual primary care service and add behavioral health or other services designed to support the needs of their employer clients, such as musculoskeletal care, second opinions, dermatology, lactation support, or nutrition services. In emergency situations, such as natural disasters or the recent COVID-19 pandemic, our clients can start new practices and see patients using our virtual care solution in a matter of days. 
 We have designed the Amwell Platform to be intuitive and convenient for both patients, providers and payors: 
  
• | Patients—For patient-initiated on-demand visits, patients can either choose a specific provider or elect to see the next available physician. For scheduled visits, patients are guided through pre-visit readiness assessments and can enroll themselves and their dependents, enter their medical history, check insurance coverage and select video or phone visits. Post visit, patients can access their visit record or share it with other providers in their care team. The Amwell Platform is rated an average of 4.8 out of 5 stars by patients on all health system and health

plan platforms, as well as our direct-to-consumer platform, and has achieved an average NPS score of 55 across our clients’ various branded services for the full-year period ended December 31, 2021.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providers—The Amwell Platform is designed to deliver an easy-to-use provider experience via web or mobile application. Providers access familiar workflows for taking notes, prescribing, referencing clinical treatment guidelines and alerts for gaps in care or referral protocols. Importantly, many of our modules can be initiated directly from within a provider’s EHR system, creating a seamless experience and reducing redundant data entry.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Payors —The Amwell Platform integrates directly with claims and eligibility systems to enable eligibility verification and collection of correct co-insurance payments from patients at the time of the visit. In addition, Amwell enables payors to present key clinical quality information, such as gaps in care, to providers at the time of a visit. The Amwell Platform also enables payors with provider networks or integrated delivery networks to seamlessly incorporate their own providers to care delivery programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Carepoints Enable a Variety of Clinical Settings 
 Patients and members access the Amwell Platform through a wide variety of Carepoints. These Carepoints include not only patient and provider supplied devices for app and web-based access over web, mobile and phone, but also a full range of purpose-built devices for use in clinical settings. Our proprietary Carepoint portfolio, which includes the C500, Touchpoint Tablet, and Hospital TV, enables providers to deliver digital care into clinical care locations, such as the Emergency Department (the “ED”), clinics and hospital at home, as well as into community settings such as retail stores, community centers, employer sites, skilled nursing facilities and schools. These devices are built to rigorous safety and clinical standards and have advanced features including far-end camera controls, fleet monitoring and connectivity to a variety of diagnostic scopes and examination tools. Our Carepoints support a range of modalities including multi-way video, phone connectivity and secure messaging to bring care teams to patients and members in the most efficient way possible. 
 Value-Added Services 
 We offer a full suite of paid, supporting services to our clients to enable their telehealth offerings. AMG contracts with more than 6,500 providers across primary and urgent care, behavioral health therapy, acute psychiatry, lactation counseling and nutrition to provide licensed, reimbursable medical staffing for digital care delivery to our clients. AMG can be used to augment provider capacity during nights, weekends or times of high demand, fill gaps in specialist coverage in acute hospital settings and to enable expanded geographic coverage in cases where state-level licensing requirements restrict the ability of our clients’ own physicians to treat patients outside of their own geographic locations. Additionally, we provide professional services to facilitate telehealth implementation, workflow design, systems integration and service expansion. To help our clients promote adoption and utilization, we offer patient and provider engagement services. 
 Our Market Opportunity 
 Core U.S. Digital Care Market 
 We believe the annual total addressable market for our solutions is substantial and increasing. We estimate the current subscription revenue market opportunity for health plan and health system customers to be approximately $8.7 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. In the health plan space, there are over 290 million lives enrolled in insurance plans that we have identified as potential subscribers to our Platform. We have also identified 802 health systems who would potentially benefit from the Amwell Platform. Additionally, in the health system space, we have identified an additional $8.4 billion for the provider-to-provider market. For AMG, we estimate the urgent care and telepsychiatry visit revenue market opportunity to be approximately $18.2 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. The broader behavioral health market is estimated to be an additional $29 billion, and this market opportunity has opened up more broadly through our acquisition of SilverCloud. Finally, our acquisition of Conversa Health brings the addition of the automated care market, which is estimated to be an additional $5 billion. This brings the total addressable market for Amwell to $76.9 billion.
 We intend to grow our addressable market through continued expansion into market adjacencies that we believe represent a significant opportunity to serve millions of additional potential patients and members. These adjacencies may include pharmaceuticals and biotech, remote patient monitoring, healthcare at home and other areas of digital care delivery. The addition of SilverCloud, with a global presence, significantly expands our international market opportunity in the behavioral health space, which is estimated to be $52 billion internationally.

Our Competitive Strengths 
 Supporting the Full Continuum of Care with Synchronous and Asynchronous Capabilities 
 The Amwell Platform enables our clients to deploy and configure care pathways that blend a range of synchronous and asynchronous services. For example, a patient may benefit from ongoing text-based therapy to assist with managing a behavioral health issue, chronic condition, or post-discharge. Yet this patient can also be escalated to a live provider via video using rules that we can configure or patient choice. The mix of automated and virtual care capabilities offered by Amwell is unique in virtual care and enables our clients to operate more efficiently while adhering to their own clinical pathways.
Enabling Our Clients Own Provider Networks 
 The Amwell Platform enables our clients to utilize their own provider networks to digitally distribute treatment to their patients and members across the continuum of care. This capability was demonstrated most clearly during the recent COVID-19 crisis, when our health system and health plan clients were able to deploy tens of thousands of their own providers onto their telehealth platforms. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 88,000 active providers utilized the Amwell Platform to address their patients’ needs, from primary care, the management of chronic care and specialist visits. We offer provider training, outreach and success services to drive increased patient acquisition and retention, appropriate utilization and better outcomes. We believe our ability to provide our clients with a platform that allows them to utilize their own trusted providers and networks differentiates us within our industry. 
Flexible and Scalable Suite of Solutions 
 Our scalable Platform allows us to grow with the digital care delivery needs of our clients. Most clients start by providing a single use case, such as urgent care, or start with a subset of their members or patients. As our clients expand their digital care delivery solutions, they can add modules that support additional specialties or specific use cases across broader patient and/or member populations. Our products are currently available in more than 40 modules and programs that offer the necessary workflows to deliver care across over 100 individual use cases. In addition to clients increasing their telemedicine use cases over time, they tend to expand their use of Carepoints as well as consumer devices. As we expand our capabilities, our module, program and Carepoint-based approach allows us to partner with clients that are new to telehealth as well as with rapidly expanding telehealth market leaders. 
Support for Third Party Applications – Including Clients’ Own Apps
 The Amwell Platform offers the ability to launch apps from within the virtual care visit. This means that clients can make care programs, such as text-based cognitive behavioral therapy or chronic condition management, available for providers to share with patients directly at the time of a visit. In addition, third party innovators who want to offer a capability to the Amwell client ecosystem, can do so.  One example of this is translation services – where Amwell has partnered with Google for real time transcription/translation, and with leading third parties for summoning live translators to join a video visit. 
Client-Branded, Embedded Digital Experiences 
 Our configurable Amwell Platform and its associated APIs and widgets encourages our clients to deploy virtual care programs under their own brands, unlike other telehealth players who promote programs under their own brands. Our differentiated approach empowers our clients to advance the look, feel and trust associated with their market-leading brands while we provide the core technology and clinical support to enable quality patient and member care. We are aligned with clients and partner with them to build tailored digital care distribution programs instead of competing with them for their patients. 
Platform Integration That Provides for the Efficient Delivery of Digital Care 
 We enable digital care distribution to be integrated into existing care pathways and workflows rather than as a separate experience. Our proprietary APIs and embeddable software widgets enable clients to embed telehealth into existing workflows utilized by providers and patients. Our Platform is provided directly within or synchronized with our providers’ EHR systems, including Cerner and Epic, as well as through the mobile apps, 24-hour nurse and customer support lines and “digital front doors” that patients and members’ access. From an experiential perspective, clients using Converge can deploy various “front door” experiences to best serve their audiences. Providers operating out of their EHRs typically prefer 
 5

operating the Converge functionality from within (embedded in) their existing platform (e.g., Hyperspace for Epic). On the patient side, a variety of front doors lead to a configured consumer experience, including SSO from a patient portal (e.g., Epic MyChart) or from a dedicated portal experience. In both cases, no additional login is required as members transition into their telehealth experience. We also integrate with back-end systems to streamline administrative functions such as enrollment, clinical management, payment, claims administration, e-prescribing, follow-up and data interchanges such as picture archiving and communication systems (“PACS”). For our clients, this functionality eases administrative burdens and supports physician workflows. For patients and members, our embedded functionality simplifies digital care delivery directly into the portals and systems those individuals are already utilizing. 
 Connected Ecosystem of Health Systems, Health Plans and Innovators 
 We partner with many of the world’s largest and most trusted health systems, health plans and healthcare innovators. Our broad range of connected healthcare providers is attractive to health plans seeking to expand their care networks, while health systems are drawn to a network with a large number of health plans that allows for the possibility to extend their services through the digital distribution of their care. For example, a large health plan is using the Amwell Platform in a program that seeks to close 20 gaps in care that are commonly seen across different high priority populations. Our ecosystem benefits from scale in our client base across each stakeholder vertical. For example, we currently work with 30 of the 35 Blue plans nationally, who benefited as we added more of their cohort and allowed members with Blue cards to seamlessly access digitally distributed care outside the geography of their individual Blue plan. Our ecosystem is also strengthened by our partnerships with innovators that bring new services and capabilities to the Amwell Platform. Our partnership with Google allows us to offer captions and translations capabilities for better provider to patient communication and our joint venture with Cleveland Clinic, The Clinic, enables Second Opinion programs through the Amwell Platform. Finally, the breadth of our ecosystem has enabled a deep understanding of health system and health plan workflows and reimbursement arrangements between our clients, allowing us to tailor our capabilities to their needs. 
Access to Scalable, On-Demand Medical Services to Help Support Our Clients’ Digital Care Solutions 
 As part of our mission to enable digital care distribution, we offer our clients a medical staffing solution for digital health services through AMG, representing over 6,500 multi-disciplinary providers with 24/7/365 coverage across 50 states, that integrates with and extends their existing care capabilities. Our acquisition of Aligned Telehealth Inc. and its clinical affiliate (“Aligned”) in 2019 (the “Aligned Acquisition”) bolstered AMG’s roster to now include over 1,600 behavioral health providers, strengthening the network we are able to offer our customers. For health plans, AMG provides essential nationwide clinical coverage for members across a broad range of specialties. For health systems, most require clinical support for their initial programs and then transition to weekend or evening coverage as their clinicians are provisioned. For rural health systems or community hospitals, these clinical services provide wraparound care or access to critical services like telestroke or psychiatry when they may not have any providers to meet these patient needs. During natural disasters or emergent health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, AMG can quickly augment staffing needs. By delivering access to on-demand medical staffing, we believe AMG brings trust and stability to our clients’ digital care delivery solutions. 
 Amwell and Google Cloud are collaborating on a suite of innovative solutions to meet the needs of healthcare clients. Amwell leverages Google’s Cloud Healthcare API to enhance its data infrastructure, providing pathways to intelligent analytics and machine learning capabilities. Examples include patient data display within clinical panels directly in the visit and intelligent patient queueing for visits driven by machine learning. Google’s Contact Center AI makes customer support more efficient and enables an enhanced support experience for customers, improving efficiency and generating deeper analytical insights to drive continuous improvements in the system. 
 Amwell is creating its App Marketplace Developer Portal. This portal gives clients and partners the opportunity to deliver critical value and ground-breaking innovation to providers, staff, and patients, while reducing the required operational complexity.
 Experienced Management 
 Our management team has extensive operational experience in healthcare, technology and services. Our co-founders are experienced entrepreneurs with a proven track record of successfully founding, growing and leading multiple companies. Our executive leadership team has an average of 20 plus years of experience. We believe our management team’s extensive business experience, along with the backing of key strategic healthcare investors, sets Amwell apart in the industry.

Our Growth Strategies 
 Drive Greater Adoption with our Existing Clients 
 We intend to continue to drive greater adoption among existing clients in four ways: 
  
• | Expanding the populations to which our clients offer services—Health plans may begin by offering telehealth to a subset of their total membership and over time expand to more members. Health systems may start with a single hospital or region and then expand system wide.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing adoption within existing populations—We see significant increases in utilization among clients as providers and patients have become more aware of and comfortable with telehealth, and as clients have embedded digital care more fully into their operations. We use targeted patient and provider engagement campaigns, best practices training as well as operational support to further drive an increase in usage across our Platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adding new modules and programs—Most clients begin with one or two use cases for digital care delivery, but then expand into additional clinical areas. For health plans, additional programs are typically focused around virtual primary care, behavioral health services, and a range of condition management services that meet the needs of employer clients as well as Medicare Advantage. For health systems, additional modules typically include an expanding range of specialty care use cases across the care continuum.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enabling the sale of new programs and services for clients to sell to their consumers and B2B customers – Many clients benefit from our scalable and customizable Platform to create high value programs to sell into their customers, whether they be Virtual Primary Care staffed by their own providers, chronic care management programs or retail urgent care. The customizable and configurable Platform allows clients to target specific populations and opens up new revenue sources for our clients, driving high value.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding their Carepoints—Clients typically increase the number of Carepoints over time, as they penetrate additional locations and expand their own network of digital care delivery. As the number of Carepoints rise, utilization goes up and our clients recognize additional value. We intend to continue to promote our proprietary Carepoints across our client base and believe that new Carepoint offerings such as our Hospital TV will further expand usage of the Amwell Platform.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase Penetration by Adding New Clients within our Core Verticals 
 While we already partner with many of the largest health systems and health plans in the United States, there is still significant room to add additional customer relationships. Additionally, Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid programs provide a significant growth opportunity as they continue to expand telehealth as a reimbursable service across use cases. We continue to invest in our direct sales force and channel management capabilities to support growth and client support. 
Invest in Platform to Continue to Expand Capabilities 
 We continue to invest in the Amwell Platform with Converge and are developing new technologies, products, modules/programs and capabilities that meet the broadening needs of our clients. We also partner with our clients and other stakeholders to build new features, modules and programs. This includes the ongoing development of our digital tools program capabilities, which allow our clients to design new healthcare protocols by combining brick and mortar services with digital healthcare delivery in areas such as primary or cancer care. Our development of Converge expands the reach of our digital platform into new areas by investing in new technologies. For example, our Hospital TV product allows patients to access digital health services in their hospital room via TVs and our planned Home TV Carepoint hardware solution will allow patients to access digital health services at Home via TVs. 
 Outside of the in-visit experience, the Amwell Platform is also designed to host a library of automated and asynchronous interactions that serve as a digital companion to patients in the space between visits. These evidence-based interactions — which include chatbots, text-message reminders and nudges, patient education resources, remote patient monitoring, and more — not only reinforce the treatment prescribed during the visit but also generate valuable data and insights for providers, with the ability to escalate to virtual or in-person care as needed. Detecting a sudden increase in pain, redness around a surgical wound, or a very high blood pressure reading, for instance, can trigger an immediate virtual visit or scheduling an in-person appointment with a clinician. Continued investment in interoperability including remote patient monitoring, advanced analytics and lab services as well as the home delivery of pharmaceuticals is expected to allow us to expand use cases.

Expand into International Markets 
 As regulatory and reimbursement systems around the world evolve, we see a significant opportunity to expand internationally. We signed our first major international client in 2017 when Meuhedet Health Services, a leading Israeli Health Maintenance Organization with 1.2 million covered lives, licensed our Platform. Meuhedet’s telehealth program, launched in 2019, created Israel’s first “Hybrid HMO” using telehealth as the first line of contact for plan members for seamless care delivery and reduced facilities costs for Meuhedet. Our acquisition of SilverCloud, which already operates as a partner of the UK’s National Health Service and as a program in other European countries, will enable growth of behavioral health services into markets outside of the U.S. Additionally, we will continue to expand sales of Carepoints into new international markets.
Selectively Pursue Acquisitions 
 Our comprehensive Amwell Platform enables us to selectively pursue strategic and complementary assets to support our clients’ needs. We have a track record of successfully identifying and integrating acquisitions. The Aligned Acquisition in 2019 expanded the number of behavioral health providers available in AMG and enhanced our ability to offer behavioral health resources and programs. Our acquisitions of SilverCloud and Conversa added proven longitudinal care and behavioral healthcare capabilities to our digital care enablement platform. SilverCloud is a leading digital mental health platform. Conversa is a leader in automated virtual healthcare. We intend to continue to complement our strong organic growth opportunities by evaluating the acquisition of complementary products and services. Consistent with this strategy, we are engaged in a number of processes related to acquisition opportunities, some of which could be significant. 
Our Products 
 The primary product we sell is access to the Amwell Platform via recurring subscriptions. We sell additional telehealth-related services and solutions via configurable modules and programs, hardware Carepoints and services, including implementation, engagement, cart fleet management and integration. These additional services can be added to any base platform subscription. We enable the success of the software we sell by also selling access to clinical services on a fee-for-service basis, on the Amwell Platform and through our direct-to-consumer app. 
Our Technology and Operations 
 Our technology platform is designed to provide superior patient and provider experiences, encompassing the complete end-to-end telehealth visit. Our backend architecture also supports security, data exchange, integration with EHRs, other data repositories and third-party devices. Finally, we offer a portfolio of services to our clients to support their telehealth platform. Converge, the latest version of the Amwell Platform includes both direct-to-patient and provider-to-provider capabilities designed to attract and retain patients, drive operational efficiency, encourage physician engagement and enable digital care delivery for health systems and engage members and lower the cost of care for health plans. 
 Direct-to-Patient Capabilities
 Multiple Digital Practices 
 Care is organized into online practices, analogous to a multi-specialty hospital building, allowing patients to choose from a variety of clinical offerings, ranging from primary to specialty care and from wellness to disease. Practices can be organized by clinical specialty (including primary care, behavioral health, nutrition, cardiology), by disease state (including diabetes, asthma, hypertension) or by program type (including smoking cessation, weight loss, addiction therapy). Each practice typically represents a distinct clinical use case with its own associated client branding, patient workflows, associated providers, eligibility, and pricing. These practices enable clients to attract patients and members and drive revenue with services they offer.
Visits 
 For urgent care and walk-in clinic type use cases, patients can seek care on-demand whenever coverage is available (typically 24/7 for urgent care). They can choose either to see the next available provider or to select a specific provider from among those currently practicing online. If a provider is busy seeing other patients, the patient can choose to wait in queue. 
 For non-urgent cases and for continuity of care, including most specialty care, patients can choose scheduled appointments. Appointments can either be self-scheduled by patients or scheduled on their behalf by an administrator or 
 8

provider. Provider availability can be synchronized with a client’s master EHR schedule using our scheduling API, eliminating the need for duplicate and potentially conflicting scheduling systems for physical and online appointments. 
 Alternatively, our “Amwell Now” functionality allows providers to initiate both scheduled and on-demand visits by sending an email or text message invitation. Visit requests can also be triggered automatically by client-configured analytics and alarms using our Telehealth Now web service. Within a few clicks, patients go from email to live video visit, without ever having to manually register or download any software. This provider-initiated visit functionality is useful for both follow-up and more general population health and care management programs. 
 Physician Brokerage and Utilization Efficiency 
 Our patented, real-time brokerage engine matches each patient with the list of available and eligible providers, based on licensing requirements and client-configurable clinical, business and regulatory rules. In this way, we are distinguished from other “callback” models where provider choice is much more limited and is unable to occur real-time. 
 When patients seek services, one or more potentially available providers are digitally paged or notified based on client-configurable business rules. The first provider to accept the visit request is assigned the patient. Together these matching technologies ensure the most efficient use of available providers, allowing even busy clinicians to schedule in telehealth patients between physical appointments, after hours, or in place of no-shows and cancellations. 
 Hospital Capabilities 
 Hospital capabilities provide hospital-based care teams everything they need to conduct provider-to provider Acute Care consults in an efficient, scalable and easy to use experience accessed via web, mobile apps and proprietary hardware Carepoints. The clinician portal is a browser-based solution for providers and administrators, while the Touchpoint mobile app facilitates coordination for providers and care team members on iOS and Android devices. Regardless of location, care teams can review requests, communicate with others, and join a video call to deliver timely and effective care. 
 Hospital capabilities offers configurable, specialty-specific software workflows to enable rapid and effective response to Acute Care needs, in accordance with a hospital’s care policies. As part of the implementation process, an Amwell team will understand current and desired workflows and configure the Amwell Platform to meet the needs of a particular administrative staff and care team. 
 Care Coordination and Collaboration Tools 
 Hospital coordination tools improve response times with case assignment tools, automated alerts and auto-escalation to avoid delays in patient care. This set of tools allows coordinators to schedule and assign providers to cases and manage the case queue. Care teams can be notified via text message, email, SMS enabled pager, on the clinician portal or the Touchpoint mobile app when a new patient case is created, assigned to a provider, escalated, cancelled or completed. The Amwell Platform empowers case team members with coordination tools that we believe are HIPAA-compliant within cases, secure messaging and multi-party video calls. Providers are further able to send secure messages between registered providers and care team members from the clinician portal and Touchpoint mobile app, as well as message other providers within the same case. 
Overall Platform Design for Converge
 User Experience
 The latest version of the Amwell Platform, Converge, is designed to be a consistent experience across any application, workflow or access point for both providers and patients. The entire use experience is also brandable by the client, letting providers and patients know they are meeting under the trusted brand of the healthcare organization they trust, driving brand affinity. Amwell uses Twilio’s A/V platform, proven to be the best-in-class option for fast, high-quality, reliable connections without having to download an app. Additionally, the modular architecture allows for swappable exchange of the entire A/V experience, allowing different vendors or capabilities such as payments or identity management to be quickly integrated into the Platform in response to customer need. 
 The user experience has also been designed to allow a patient to easily join a visit through Click to Join features: patients can join video visits by clicking on an email or text message, no registration or download required. Tech checks ensure adequate connectivity, browser compatibility and the correct A/V setting, minimizing the risk of dropped or interrupted visits.

Security and Reliability
 Converge has been designed to be secure and scalable, and testing is automated and includes security scans, all vetted by our QA team. These scans are also vetted by our dedicated cybersecurity team, which includes security experts who monitor and address issues around the clock. We also have a full, evidence-grade digital forensics system which provides real-time analysis using multiple cloud forensic tools to our cybersecurity team. Amwell adheres to what we believe to be the highest security standards in the industry, using Auth0 with OAuth 2.0 single sign-on webRTC for in-browser video and Google’s Healthcare API for secure and standardized data storage, and intelligent patient queuing for visits driven by machine learning. These security capabilities ensure that clients’ and patient data are held to high standards, limiting the impact of and ability for cyberattacks.
Scalability and Innovation
 Converge allows providers to easily expand their use of telehealth, taking advantage of highly scalable managed services from best-in-class technology partners. A serverless multi-cloud microservices architecture lets Amwell adapt to any scale of processing power needed to address visit volumes. Clients can quickly implement a unique experience for patients and providers and embed any workflow their own branded web and mobile solutions with low code / no code custom development. As digital care delivery continues to evolve, Amwell’s clients and partners have the flexibility and agility to scale telehealth 10x, or 1,000x, as needed. 
Interoperability
 Converge is built on FHIR (“Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources”) – not an antiquated, proprietary data model that needs to be translated to HL7 standards. All data within the Platform works with healthcare organizations’ systems and any EHR. Being FHIR native allows Amwell to be truly interoperable with the entire healthcare ecosystem and creates an open platform for third-party developers.
App Framework
 We have opened Converge to others to build on and expand its abilities. The Platform now hosts and operates applications created by outside developers, whether to serve their own organizations or offer innovations to our large ecosystem. The FHIR APIs at the core can invoke and give context to any external service, which can then be hosted inside the telehealth experience, right in the field of view between the patient and the clinician. Apps from several key partners are in development, including Google Cloud, Globo, The Clinic and Conversa. This app framework allows clients to deliver better and more efficient access to effective care, helping to close gaps in case, enhance treatment and better enable provider to patient relationships.
Technology Back-end Architecture 
 Secure, Scalable, Hosted Environment 
 We host the Amwell Platform in secure, redundant data centers designed with high levels of availability, redundant subsystems, and compartmentalized security zones. With our Platform as a service telehealth solution, there is no need for clients to purchase hardware, install and upgrade software, or manage system operations. The hosted approach also ensures that visit capacity scales without requiring client-side interventions or upgrades. We manage hosting operations and security from our NOC, which is monitored 24 hours a day. 
 Due to the sensitive nature of our client and patient data, we have invested heavily in data security and protection. We utilize a multi-tiered security architecture. All data is secured both in motion and at rest using the latest encryption technologies. Our C3 data control center constantly monitors for vulnerabilities and intrusions, including using third-party penetration testing. We believe that all clinical data usage is HIPAA compliant. We maintain HITRUST, ISO 27001, and PCI compliance certifications. Our system security is regularly evaluated and approved by some of the largest health plans, health systems, financial institutions, and technology companies in the world. 
 Reporting and Analytics 
 We provide a range of standard administrative, utilization and clinical reports. More advanced analytics are user-accessible via our Looker data exploration and discovery business intelligence tool.

Branding and SDK Integration 
 We support client branding and unique client experiences by offering the ability to fully brand our software as well as to use our APIs and embeddable widgets for both the patient and provider experiences, covering the relevant web and mobile interfaces (iOS and Android). The APIs and embeddable widgets in turn allow clients to seamlessly embed our end-to-end patient and provider telehealth functionality in their own websites, software, and mobile applications. Such embedding is designed to give patients and providers a consistent user experience without having to switch tabs or windows, or to download additional applications. Clients also have more flexibility to rearrange workflows, turn on or off specific functionality, and customize the overall experience. 
 For example, some health systems have embedded our Platform in their own patient portals. From a provider perspective, clients are embedding the provider telehealth workflow in their EHRs so that online visits are as easy to schedule and conduct as physical visits. 
 Finally, for international clients, we use the SDK and other embeddable widgets to separate the user experience requiring extensive localization from the backend core functionality that requires less locale-specific changes. For example, with Meuhedet in Israel, we use our SDK to support the Hebrew language. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our telehealth solution through our direct sales organization. Our direct sales team is comprised of enterprise-focused field sales professionals who are organized principally by geography and specialty overlays. Our sales operations staff, who support our direct sales team, includes product technology experts, lead generation professionals and sales data experts. We maintain relationships with key industry participants including media publications, industry analyst firms, benefit consultants, brokers, group purchasing organizations and health plan and health system partners. 
 Channel partners also play an important role in marketing and selling our products to our customer base, primarily focusing on the Amwell Platform and Carepoints. Channel partners may shorten our sales cycle and lower our customer acquisition costs. For example, through our EHR channel partners we are able to natively embed our technology into existing health system technology infrastructure which, as a competitive differentiator, may lead to a higher win rate. In addition, because of the technology integration, an EHR partner sale may accelerate our ability to launch the technology and ultimately recognize revenue. Carepoint channel partners primarily consist of value-added resellers that have established relationships with health systems and health plans. We typically generate lower revenues in connection with sales obtained through these channel partner agreements. 
 Clients 
 Our clients consist of health plans, health systems, government clients and innovator companies that are working to develop next-generation therapeutics, devices, and health programs 
 Quality 
 We are strongly focused on providing the highest level of clinical and operational quality. AMG seeks to provide the highest level of clinical quality and consistency of care. All medical professionals go through a rigorous onboarding and credential checking process. When practicing online, doctors are required to wear white coats, display degrees, and deliver care in a medically appropriate visual setting. We offer similar best practices and training to our clients who engage their own providers. Patients consistently rate AMG providers highly, with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5.0. 
 Our AMG clinical operations team works to standardize medical telehealth treatment by creating and maintaining standard operating procedures. Our operations team also monitors waiting room queues and can reassign providers and patients as needed. We use analytics to test for appropriateness and efficiency of care as well as prescribing behaviors. Our team of quality nurses uses algorithms to identify potential quality issues, and also conducts manual reviews of clinical cases, utilizing a random audit process, to ensure high quality care is consistently delivered. Finally, a monthly scorecard is distributed to all AMG providers showing their individual and comparative performance. 
 From an operations perspective we historically deliver high levels of system uptime across the Amwell Platform, maintained through our 24/7 Cyber Command Center that monitors our Platform around the clock. For urgent care, the median wait time is less than 5 minutes for the 24 months ended December 31, 2021. 
 11

Research and Development 
 Our ability to continue to differentiate and enhance the Amwell Platform depends, in large part, on our capacity to continue to introduce new services, technologies, features, and functionality. Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our solution. We also maintain a development office in Ramat Gan, Israel, to support our international partners and to serve as an additional development resource. In addition, we utilize certain third-party development services to perform application development. We focus our research and development spend on developing new products and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of our solution. 
Competition 
 We view as competitors those companies whose primary business is developing and marketing telehealth platforms and services. Competition focuses on, among other factors, technology, breadth and depth of functionality, range of associated services, operational experience, customer support, extent of customer base, and reputation. Our competitors in the digital care delivery market range from traditional telehealth players such as Teladoc, Included Health and MDLive; video communications players such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams; physician networks or tools such as Doximity and Caregility; technology companies such as Amazon and EHR players (which are also partners) such as Epic, Allscripts and Athenahealth. 
 In the health system market, EHR players could be considered competitors, but many have chosen to partner with us to integrate our capabilities into their own products. Other players have chosen to partner with us to embed our telehealth functionality within their EHR. Competition also comes from large communications software players who offer an entry-level priced and simplified offering for telehealth. Newer players include companies who provide asynchronous chat communications. We believe that the breadth of our existing client ecosystem, the depth of our Platform, and our business-to-business focus on promoting existing healthcare brands and integrating freely with multiple platforms increases the likelihood that stakeholders seeking to develop telehealth solutions, both within and outside of healthcare, will choose instead to collaborate with Amwell. 
 Physicians and Healthcare Professionals 
 Due to the prevalence of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, including in the states where we predominantly conduct our business, we provide administrative and management services to entities associated with AMG (which are consolidated subsidiaries from a financial reporting perspective) pursuant to which those entities reserve exclusive control and responsibility for all aspects of the practice of medicine and the delivery of medical services. We contract to provide administrative services through business support agreements (“BSAs”) with AMG’s provider groups. AMG in turn contracts with more than 6,500 providers. Our business support agreements typically run for ten years and call for us to be paid an annual fee in exchange for managing all administrative aspects of the medical practice in question. It has been the historical practice of the parties to review and adjust this fee on an annual basis. In addition, we have signed direct transfer agreements with the AMG entities. These direct transfer agreements outline the conditions under which we have the right to change the ownership of the clinical entity to a different third party. 
 In 2012, we entered into a joint venture with an affiliate of Anthem, Inc. to form National Telehealth Network, LLC (“NTN”). NTN, which is consolidated in our financial statements, is greater than 50% owned by us. NTN is managed by a six person Board of Managing Directors, with the Chairman of the Board appointed by us. NTN’s mandate is to oversee the clinical and administrative operations of Online Care Group, a clinical entity within the AMG family. Online Care Group is dedicated to providing clinical consults on Anthem’s LiveHealth Online telehealth platform to Anthem members and other users of that platform. 
 Under a BSA agreement, NTN has agreed to provide exclusive administrative, management and other business support services to Online Care Group. The non-medical functions and services NTN provides under the BSA include the maintenance of medical, billing and accounting records, legal, human resources and the administration of quality assurance, and administration of a risk management program. Additionally, NTN is required to maintain medical malpractice insurance for covered providers as well as appropriate general liability, directors and officers, workers compensation and employment practices insurance. The BSA has a 10-year term (with 5-year automatic renewals thereafter), expiring in February 2023 unless earlier terminated upon mutual agreement of the parties or unilaterally by a party following a material default under the BSA by the non-terminating party. NTN, in turn, has subcontracted all of its responsibilities under the BSA between NTN and Online Care Group to Amwell, under substantially similar terms. 
 12

Amwell has signed direct BSAs with the other AMG affiliated entities to provide similar administrative and management services for a fixed fee. 
 U.S. Government Regulation 
 Our operations are subject to comprehensive United States federal, state and local and international regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers, to maintain all necessary licenses and to operate in compliance with applicable laws and rules. Those laws and rules continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare and medical practice regulation. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In some jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of formal judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that impacts our operations. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, state and federal regulatory authorities loosened or removed a number of regulatory requirements in order to increase the availability of telehealth services. For example, many state governors issued executive orders permitting physicians and other health care professionals to practice in their state without any additional licensure or by using a temporary, expedited or abbreviated licensure process so long as they hold a valid license in another state. In addition, changes were made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs (through waivers and other regulatory authority) to increase access to telehealth services by, among other things, increasing reimbursement, permitting the enrollment of out of state providers and eliminating prior authorization requirements. It is uncertain how long these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect and whether they will continue beyond this public health emergency period.
 We believe that a return to the status quo would not have a material negative impact on any commercial agreements we have entered into during 2020 and 2021. Each of these agreements has a defined term and virtually none allow for immediate termination for convenience by the customer in question. For many health care companies engaging in telehealth, the most significant potential concern about returning to the status quo is that restrictions on the reimbursement of telehealth visits to Medicare beneficiaries, such as when a patient presents to a medical professional from a rural area or at a clinical site, could be re-imposed. 
 Currently, AMG, the Company’s affiliated provider group, does not perform these kinds of consultations. As such, all patients who experienced a first-time visit with AMG during the pandemic would be able to continue using the Amwell Platform. In light of that, we do not believe that the visit volume on the Amwell Platform or visit revenue will materially decrease based on a return to the status quo from a regulatory perspective. In fact, we believe that such a return would benefit the Company as the renewed enforcement of HIPAA regulations may force many marginal telehealth platforms out of the marketplace, thereby lessening our competition. 
 Telehealth Provider Licensing, Medical Practice, Certification and Related Laws and Guidelines 
 The practice of medicine is subject to various federal, state and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals and standards, relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, the practice of medicine (including the provision of remote care), equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication and ordering of tests. The application of some of these laws to telehealth is unclear and subject to differing interpretation. 
 Physicians who provide professional medical services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine in the state in which the patient is located. We have established systems for ensuring that our affiliated physicians are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our members occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in licensure actions against the physicians, our services being found to be non-reimbursable, or prior payments being subject to recoupments and can give rise to civil, criminal or administrative penalties. 
 Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws in the U.S.; Fee Splitting 
 We contract with physicians or physician owned professional associations and professional corporations to provide access to our Platform to them and their patients. We have entered into management services contracts with AMG affiliated entities pursuant to which we provide them with billing, scheduling and a wide range of other administrative and management services, and they pay us for those services via management and other service fees. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws, including those of New York, Texas and California, that prohibit fee splitting or the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons and that are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with 
 13

or influencing a physician’s professional judgment. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. Under the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of certain states, decisions and activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates and the hiring and management of non-clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine. 
 State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws and rules vary from state to state and are not always consistent among states. In addition, these requirements are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our engagement of a provider licensed in the state or the provision of telehealth to a resident of the state. Thus, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our providers, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee splitting. In such event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our affiliated providers, civil, criminal or administrative penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our providers that interfere with our business, and other materially adverse consequences. 
 U.S. Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 Federal Stark Law 
 We are subject to the federal self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. Where applicable, this law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients for “designated health services” such as laboratory and radiology services that are furnished at an entity if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a “financial relationship” with the entity, unless an exception applies. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $25,820 per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $172,137 for a circumvention scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes, including the Stark Law, can be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act (described below) based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute 
 We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly worded and prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs or (iii) the purchasing, leasing or ordering or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if “one purpose” of a payment is to induce referrals. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation, making it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the requisite state of mind or “scienter” required for a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, as discussed below. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $104,330 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of more than $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Imposition of any of these remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the OIG has published safe-harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG. 
 Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources comply with current law and available interpretative guidance, as a practical matter, it is not always possible to structure our arrangements so as to fall squarely within an available safe harbor. Where that is the case, we cannot guarantee that applicable regulatory authorities 
 14

will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws, including state anti-kickback laws. 
 False Claims Act 
 Both federal and state government agencies have continued civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies and their executives and managers. Although there are a number of civil and criminal statutes that can be applied to healthcare providers, a significant number of these investigations involve the federal False Claims Act. These investigations can be initiated not only by the government but also by a private party asserting direct knowledge of fraud. These “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits may be initiated against any person or entity alleging such person or entity has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, the improper retention of an overpayment for 60 days or more is also a basis for a False Claim Act action, even if the claim was originally submitted appropriately. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $11,803 to $23,607 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare programs. 
Foreign and State Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 Several states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have also adopted or may adopt similar fraud, whistleblower and false claims laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary by jurisdiction and are enforced by local courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by Medicaid programs and any third party payer, including commercial insurers or to any payer, including to funds paid out of pocket by a patient. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 
Other Healthcare Laws 
 HIPAA established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non-governmental payers of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund an overpayment. These provisions are intended to punish some of the same conduct in the submission of claims to private payers as the federal False Claims Act covers in connection with governmental health programs. 
 In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties associated with the wrongful act. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The OIG emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts, and statutory or common law fraud.

U.S. State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws 
 There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of PII, including health information. In particular, HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of PHI, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI in electronic form. AMG, our health system clients, and our health plan clients are all regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. We are a business associate of our covered entity clients when we are working on behalf of our covered entity clients including our affiliated medical groups and also when we are providing technology services to those clients via our Platform. As a business associate, we are also directly regulated by HIPAA and are required to provide satisfactory written assurances to our covered entity clients through written business associate agreements that we will provide our services in accordance with HIPAA. Failure to comply with these contractual agreements could lead to loss of clients, contractual liability to our clients, and direct action by HHS, including monetary penalties. 
 Violations of HIPAA may result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Our management responsibilities to AMG include assisting it with its obligations under HIPAA’s breach notification rule. Under the breach notification rule, covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which may compromise the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to HHS and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. HIPAA also requires a business associate to notify its covered entity clients of breaches by the business associate. 
 State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts. 
 HIPAA also required HHS to adopt national standards for electronic transactions that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically. On January 16, 2009, HHS released the final rule mandating that everyone covered by HIPAA must implement ICD 10 for medical coding on October 1, 2013, which was subsequently extended to October 1, 2015, and is now in effect. 
 Many states in which we operate and in which our patients reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but, unlike HIPAA, some may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject. 
 In addition to HIPAA and state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security acts or practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security and laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting. The FTC and states’ attorneys general have brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act and similar state laws. 
 In recent years, there have been a number of well publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of PII and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials and provide credit monitoring services and/or other relevant services to impacted individuals. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts that we enter into with our clients who are covered entities, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our clients following discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others. 
 16

International Regulation 
 We expect over time to continue to expand our operations in foreign countries through both organic growth and acquisitions. In such a case, our international operations will be subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by jurisdiction, including anti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate governance, privacy, data protection (including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation which became effective in May 2018 across the EU), data mining, data transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures; required localization of records and funds; and limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital. In addition, the expansion of our operations into foreign countries increases our exposure to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of U.S. law, including the FCPA, and corresponding foreign laws, including the UK Bribery Act. 
 The FCPA prohibits offering, promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. We also are subject to applicable anti-corruption laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and the DOJ have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The UK Bribery Act is an anti-corruption law that is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to all companies with a nexus to the United Kingdom. Disclosures of FCPA violations may be shared with the UK authorities, thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions. We have internal control policies and procedures and conduct training and compliance programs for our employees to deter prohibited practices. However, if our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing our international operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. 
 We also are subject to regulation by OFAC. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. In addition, we may be subject to similar regulations in the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate.

 Recruitment
 In 2021, we continued to focus on building a strong pipeline of talent. Amwell has built partnerships with Universities and other organizations across the country and has implemented a competitive intern program to develop a diverse candidate pool. In addition, our virtual workforce strategy has allowed us to open a national recruitment strategy to hire from all geographies to support our diverse pipeline. As of 2021, women represented 43% of our global employees and 29% were non-white. We continue to prioritize our diverse recruitment strategy to build a strong pipeline for women and people of color in our management and leadership roles. 
Growth and Development
 At Amwell, we promote the continued growth and development of our employees. Through our learning management system, we create meaningful pathways for our employees to build the technical and comprehensive sales skills they need, and off role-specific trainings and certifications. We support our managers with leadership training, a 360 program, and coaching. In addition, we encourage on-going external learning and development opportunities with our tuition assistance program.
Compensation and Benefits
 Amwell believes that compensation should be competitive, transparent, and equitable. We also recognize the benefit offering a comprehensive benefits package as another way we take care of our employees. We offer the full scope of healthcare coverage, retirement planning, life and disability insurance, employee assistance programs, financial education, mental health support and days off, Covid leave policy, one volunteer day, unlimited PTO and access to our own suite of products and services. We also offer full access to all telehealth services to our employees and their immediate family members.
Engagement
 We value employee feedback and listen to our employees through various outlets, including all hands meetings and yearly engagement surveys. These avenues have provided us with valuable feedback that has shaped our investments in programs and initiatives for our employees. In 2021, employee feedback shaped our virtual work strategy, the creation of additional technology resources, investments in learning and development platforms, and employee benefits. The Amwell employee voice is the most powerful tool we have for increasing our engagement and the development of a strong and inclusive team.
 Amwell has an open-door policy where employees are always welcome to voice concerns about anything related to Amwell or their employment. They have avenues such as Human Resources, Management or the ability to submit concerns anonymously through our ethics hotline or by phone.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 
Our culture is built on diverse perspectives, which help us think differently and better equip our clients, providers and patients with the tools to realize an improved healthcare experience for all. We aim to spark dialogue and help create a more humane and compassionate world.
 Because healthcare is a universal need spanning the full spectrum of humanity, it’s our mission to:

 Our Company DE&I Pillars and Internal DE&I Committee help guide our initiatives and drive our mission forward. The committee fosters education and development opportunities to educate the employees on topics critical to us in our lives and in the workforce. In 2021 we offered numerous inclusion trainings as well as education on selective diverse populations and cultures led by our grassroots DE&I Committee.

 Investing in our Communities 
 Amwell Cares is Amwell’s Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative. Guided by Amwell’s purpose, mission, and values, Amwell Cares is committed to enriching and giving back to the communities we serve, working to advance healthcare, hunger relief and equality for all. Driven by employees, with executive oversight, Amwell Cares works to support various causes through a variety of activities, including but not limited to company matches, sponsorship of and participation in charity walks/runs, donations and volunteer opportunities, and pro bono healthcare services delivered to communities affected by hurricane, fire, or flood. Employees are also encouraged to also volunteer on their own and are given a designated volunteer day to allow them time to give back in their local community. In 2021 our employees served nearly 400 hours of community services and Amwell donated over $150K in cash and pro bono healthcare services to support our local communities. 
 Social Responsibility 
 Social responsibility is deeply embedded in our mission oriented corporate culture. We never forget that beyond the daily numbers and operating tasks, our goal is to transform how healthcare is delivered by improving access, convenience, economics and quality of care via telehealth, initially focusing our efforts on the United States and with an eye toward increasing the reach of such changes internationally. We are proud of our ability to extend access to both primary and specialty care in “healthcare deserts” that exist in both rural and urban pockets domestically and even more so internationally. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our patent portfolio consists of approximately 41 patents and 2 pending patent applications related to our software and technology. The Company does not currently consider any of its patents to be material to its business. We continue to submit patent applications for new inventions and ideas the Company develops as well as monitor competitors in an effort to protect our intellectual property. 
 We own and use trademarks and service marks on or in connection with our services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in the United States. In addition, we rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties and on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary processes and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. We require our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors to execute confidentiality, agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement while using our property or which relate to our business. 
 19

From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings relating to intellectual property arising in the ordinary course of our business, including oppositions to our applications for trademarks or patents, challenges to the validity of our intellectual property rights, and claims of intellectual property infringement. We are not presently a party to any such legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Seasonality
 Visit volumes typically follow the annual flu season, rising during quarter four and quarter one and falling in the summer months. The future impact of COVID-19 on seasonality is unknown as there could be additional surges and demand on telehealth visits. While we sell to and implement our solutions to clients year-round, we experience some seasonality in terms of when we enter into agreements with our clients and when we launch our solutions to members. We typically enter into a higher percentage of agreements with new clients, as well as renewal agreements with existing clients, in the first and fourth quarters. Regardless of when the agreement is entered into, we can typically complete client implementation in an average of approximately three months.
