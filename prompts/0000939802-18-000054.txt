Item 1. Description of Business
Corporate Developments
 
Brisset Beer International, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on May 11, 2010 under the name Benefit Solutions Outsourcing Corp. The Company was initially formed to offer small and medium-sized businesses services that reduced invoicing expenses, sped up receipt of monies, and allowed authorization and recovery of paper drafts.
 
On April 4, 2014, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with Scenario A, a Quebec corporation ("Scenario A"), to purchase all of its assets relating to "Broken 7", a craft beer to be brewed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, for a purchase price of $25,000. The Asset Purchase Agreement relates to the Broken 7 trademark and recipe only. No other assets were acquired. $12,500 was paid at closing and $12,500 was to be paid 60 business days after the closing date of April 7, 2014. By letter agreement dated July 16, 2014, the parties agreed to extend the date on which the second payment of $12,500 was due to August 15, 2014. The Company made the final installment of $12,500 to Scenario A on August 14, 2014.
 
Effective July 24, 2014, the Company changed its state of incorporation from Florida to Nevada and its name from "Buckeye Oil & Gas, Inc." to "Brisset Beer International, Inc." by the merger of Buckeye Oil & Gas, Inc. with and into its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brisset Beer International, Inc.
 
Until April 2014, the Company was engaged in the acquisition and exploration of oil and gas properties. Since its asset purchase in April 2014, the Company has abandoned its interests in its two oil and gas properties and is principally engaged in the development of a brewing, distribution and marketing of craft-brewed beer business in the province of Quebec, Canada. Our craft beer consists of a single brand known as Broken 7, which we distribute to private retail stores, grocery chains and on-premise accounts across Quebec, Canada.

On November 10, 2014, the Company entered into a Service Agreement with Sandberg International Limited to provide investor relations for the Company. For such services, Sandberg International receives $500 per month, and on November 10, 2014, was issued 125,000 shares of common stock of the Company, Class A warrants to purchase 125,000 shares of common stock exercisable at $0.15 per share and a Class B warrant to purchase 125,000 shares of common stock exercisable at $0.25 per share. The agreement shall continue until either party notifies the other that it desires to terminate the agreement on 30 days' written notice.
 
On December 2, 2014 Biere Brisset International Inc., a Canadian corporation wholly-owned subsidiary by  Company ("BBII"), entered into a five-year Manufacturing and Distribution Agreement (the "Distribution Agreement") with 90127-2021 Quebec Inc., a Quebec company doing business as Breuvages Blue Spike ("Blue Spike") pursuant to which Blue Spike has the exclusive right to manufacture, distribute and sell BBII's Broken 7 beer in certain designated networks in the following Canadian provinces and U.S. states: Newfoundland, Prince-Edward Island, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Washington DC, Delaware, Maryland. The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal to act as exclusive agent for the distribution and sale of its products in other new territories.
 
On April 1, 2016, BBII amended the Distribution agreement (the "Amendment") with Blue Spike to clarify certain of the business terms regarding the margins, pricing and distribution networks.
 
Subject to Blue Spike's approval, the Company may sell products manufactured by Blue Spike in the Company's own distribution network. Products sold within the Company's own distribution network are subject to higher margins for the Company. The Company is responsible, at its expense, for the marketing and promotion of Broken 7, and has agreed to invest 25% of the gross margin of its products for marketing and advertising.
 
The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal if the Company sells or transfers all or a portion of its rights in its brands. If the Company is sold during the term of the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Blue Spike 2.5% of the purchase price for every $250,000 of product sales, up to $5 million but not to exceed 50% of the sale price. The agreement also provides for various payment returns to Blue Spike if the Company is sold when the agreement is no longer in effect, depending on when and why the agreement is no longer in effect. The agreement will automatically renew for an additional five-year term unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew 180 days prior to the expiration of the initial term.
 
On March 1, 2015, BBII entered into a five-year manufacturing and distribution agreement (the "CBB Agreement") with La Compagnie de Biere Brisset, Inc. ("CBB"), a specialty brewer, to help bring to market and test new line extensions for beer brands owned by the Company. The CBB Agreement grants CBB the right to manufacture Broken 7 beer in accordance with certain minimum and production capacities set forth in the Agreement. Proceeds, if any, from the sale of BBI products will be retained by CBB as compensation for its services. Unless earlier terminated by BBII's bankruptcy, insolvency or sale of its business or assets or the gross misconduct or negligence of CBB, the Agreement will automatically renew for an additional five-year term unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew 180 days prior to the expiration of the initial term.
 
On April 1, 2016, BBII amended the manufacturing and distribution agreement (the "Amendment") with Blue Spike to clarify certain of the business terms regarding the margins, pricing and distribution networks.
 
The Distribution Agreement and the CBB Agreement were terminated on March 2, 2018.

Industry Background
 
Based on the most recent data available from the Government of Canada's Department of Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, Canadian brewers today hold an 89% share of the domestic beer market. In 2012, 242 establishments were operating in Canada with the majority in Ontario (90), British Columbia (68) and Quebec (49). The industry generated revenues of $4.9 billion, and employed 9,081 people. Sales of beer in Canada totaled 2.3 billion liters in 2013, with 2.0 billion liters representing Canadian beer. The beer industry is dominated by three major multinational companies who control approximately 90% of retail sales. Given the growing consumer interest in international beer selection, the industry is a net importer of beer, with imports amounting to $671.2 million in 2014 and exports of $215.4 million in the same year. The United States accounts for 96% of exports and the majority of imports come from the United States (25%), followed by the Netherlands (19%), Mexico, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. Between 2004 and 2012, sales of goods manufactured by the Canadian beer industry increased 11.6% from $4.4 billion to $4.9 billion. During the same period, exports of beer declined at an average annual rate of 4.1%, imports had an average annual growth rate of 6.8%. Imports as a percentage of the domestic market increased slightly from 8% in 2004, up to 11.4% in 2012. In 2012, direct employment returned to 2004 levels with just over 9,000 employees. In recent years the craft beer industry has experienced resurgence. Even as per capita beer consumption dropped, sales and consumption of craft beers have been on the rise
 
According to the 2015 Annual Statistical Bulletin released from Beer Canada, a voluntary trade association based in Ottawa, Ontario, in 2014 Canadians enjoyed over 22 million hectoliters (hL) of beer. Canadian beer accounts for 84% of this figure, totaling 18,944,275 hL, a decrease of 1.2% compared to 2013. Imported beer sales increased by 3.7% in 2014 to a total of 3,571,558 hL. Since 2009 the Canadian beer category has declined by 795,295 hL or 3.4%. The number of licensed breweries in Canada has risen almost 70% over the past five years to 520 operating in 2014. Over half of these breweries make their products in Ontario and Québec. For years the Canadian beer industry has held an impressive environmental record in terms of brewing plant operations and control of packaging. An average of 99% of beer bottles are returned in Canada. Increasing can sales show the container rose to a 51.1% share of the domestic packaged beer market in 2014. Draught sales grew slightly by 0.20% and bottle sales fell 3.8%. Total (domestic + imported) wine sales increased by 2.2% between 2013 and 2014. Coolers and spirit sales increased by 0.5% and 0.2% respectively. Consumer Price Index figures from Statistics Canada show Canada's overall inflation in 2014 rose by 2.0%. In the beverage alcohol category, beer and spirits prices rose while wine prices fell. Retail prices for beer and spirits increased 1.1% and wine prices decreased 0.2%. Domestic consumption of Canadian and imported beer in 2014 stood at 64.35 liters per person based on total population. At the provincial level, per capita consumption is highest in Newfoundland at 79.39 liters. Québec and Alberta have the second and third highest per capita consumption at 72.27 and 68.15 liters respectively.
 
According to the latest statistics from the Brewers Association in the U.S., craft beer sales volume increased 12.8% to 24.1 million barrels of beer in 2015 over 2014, reaching 12.2% of the total market share of beer sales. The craft beer market reached $22.3 billion, which represents dollar sales growth of 16% in 2015 over 2014. In terms of U.S. beer production volume, craft beer increased 13% in 2015 over 2014, and the number of craft breweries increased 18.1% to 4,225 in 2015 over 2014.
 
Small and independent American craft brewers contributed $55.7 billion to the U.S. economy in 2014. The figure is derived from the total impact of beer brewed by craft brewers as it moves through the three-tier system (breweries, wholesalers and retailers), as well as all non-beer products like food and merchandise that brewpub restaurants and brewery taprooms sell.
 
The craft beer industry in the U.S. also provided more than 424,000 jobs, with more than 115,000 jobs directly at breweries and brewpubs, including serving staff at brewpubs.
 
Business Strategy
 
We brew, market and sell a craft beer brand called Broken 7, which is brewed in Quebec, Canada. Craft beer is defined as a beer with a distinctive flavor, produced in small quantities and distributed in a particular region. Current Broken 7 product lineup includes Blonde Ale 500ml bottles, Blonde Ale 30L kegs, Blonde Ale 50L kegs, IPA 500ml bottles, IPA 30L kegs, IPA 50L kegs.
Community events to date include: Adidas Montreal, St. Patrick's Day Prohibition, St. Patrick's Day BierMarkt, Lancement Atelier Le Gymnase, BierMarkt Staff Party, Les Houblonneries, Broken 7 Takeover, Meat the Street, Exposition Jake Bannon Neon Stores & Broken 7, Portes Ouvertes Enterprises, Vernissage David Bicari, Brasserie Biere Brisset Spring Cleaning, Kick Off Party Les Princes, Tournois Les Princes, Surf Swap, Degustation chez Les Technologies Seedbox, 1er Juillet - Chez Dallaire & Broken 7.

Beer Festivals to date include: Mondial de la Biere, Festibere de Gatineau.
 
Broken 7 is the official beer of Ca Va Brasser for the 2016 season. Ca Va Brasser is a TV show which profiles microbreweries in Quebec and is aired on the French-language television network, V. As a cross promotion with Ca Va Brasser, Broken 7 created an exclusive, limited edition flavor of beer (Pale Ale) for sale in participating Metro stores across Quebec.
 
The central elements of our business strategy include:
 
 
· | Develop great tasting beers with vintage labels inspired by Kölsch Pilsners and American-style India Pale Ales.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Engage our contract brewer to produce, bottle, distribute, and label our Broken 7 products, which allows us to focus on sales and marketing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Target retail chains, grocery outlets, independent craft beer stores, and on-premise accounts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Implement an aggressive retail distribution program focused on approximately 1,500 stores across Quebec.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Display and promote Broken 7 in retail chains that make our products accessible to consumers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Access independent craft beer stores and negotiate premium fridge shelf position to attract consumer attention.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Activate the brand in on-premise market campaigns.
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | Promote the brand through social media.
--+----------------------------------------


· | Participate in Quebec's beer festivals to promote the brand and connect with the target consumer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strategically price Broken 7 products at a premium level to give the retailers stronger margins to push and create promotions.

Brand Overview
 
The naming of our flagship brand Broken 7 is based on a sports analogy with the number 7 representing the seventh member of a sports team. We market Broken 7 to consumers by using the strong connections between the brewing and sports industries.
 
Broken 7 Blonde Ale is an ale inspired by the Kölsch beers of Cologne, Germany. It uses Pilsner toasted wheat, carafoam malt, and Halertau hops. We believe it is an easy drinking craft beer packaged with a vintage label that appeals to consumers.
 
Broken 7 IPA is an India Pale Ale brewed in the American style. It uses Cascade, Chinook, and Citra hops, and Canadian Two Row and Crystal 75 malts. We believe that the result is a smooth and bitter IPA that is well-balanced, and full of character. Like the Blonde Ale, it is packaged with a vintage label that we believe appeals to consumers.
 
Operations
 
Brewing Facilities
 
We do not intend to have our own brewery. Our strategy is to hire contract brewers.
 
On December 2, 2014, the Company entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement with Blue Spike, which grants Blue Spike the exclusive right to manufacture and act as its agent to distribute and sell its Broken 7 bottled beer and keg products in certain designated Canadian provinces and nineteen states in the U.S.
 
On March 1, 2015, the Company entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement with CBB to help bring to market and test new beer recipes. Proceeds, if any, from the sale of our beers are retained by CBB as compensation for its services.
 
On April 1, 2016, BBII amended the manufacturing and distribution agreement to clarify several sections of the agreement, include new Broken 7 products, and include the updated BBII Margins for new Broken 7 products.
 
We believe that by using contract brewers to produce, bottle, distribute, and label Broken 7 products, we have been able to reach initial sales much earlier and with less initial capital investment than if we had built our own brewing plant. Hiring contract brewers has also allowed us to focus our efforts on sales and marketing of our brand.
 
The Distribution Agreement was terminated on March 2, 2018.

Packaging
 
We currently sell Broken 7 Blonde Ale and Broken 7 IPA in 500 milliliter bottles, 30-liter kegs, and 50-liter kegs. We are also testing new Broken 7 recipes in 50-liter kegs. In the future, we have plans to distribute Broken 7 products in 473-milliliter cans.
Quality Control
 
Our quality control panel meets at the time each brew is complete. The panel tastes each batch to ensure we deliver the best beer we can. The panel consists of three experienced brewers, our president and a representative of the contract brewer.
Ingredients and Raw Materials
 
Broken 7 Blonde Ale is an ale inspired by the Kölsch beers of Cologne Germany, and uses Pilsner toasted wheat, carafoam malt, and Halertau hops. Broken 7 IPA is an American-style India Pale Ale that uses Cascade, Chinook, and Citra hops and Canadian Two Row and Crystal 75 malts. The Company has contracted out services to a contract brewer who is responsible for acquiring the ingredients and raw materials for the two beers we sell. The Company has also contracted out services to another contract brewer who is responsible for acquiring the ingredients and raw materials for the beer recipes that we test.
Distribution
 
In the province of Quebec, the distribution system is direct from the brewery to the retailer. With limited exceptions, all brewers in the United States are required to sell their beers to independent wholesalers, who then sell the beers to retailers. The Company contracts out services to Blue Spike for brewing, labeling and distribution of our bottled products and kegs. Blue Spike delivers beer to vendors on behalf of the Company, collects the proceeds from sale, and then pays the Company the respective commission. Broken 7 is currently sold in Quebec, Canada.
Sales and Marketing
 
We have five main marketing programs for Broken 7.
 
 
1. | Online. We believe that our online communications program increases Broken 7's visibility to consumers. The purpose of the online communication program is to direct consumers to the Broken 7 website. The address of our website is www.brissetbeer.com. The website includes a store locator that informs consumers of the closest retailer that carries Broken 7. The web site also hosts an online shop that offers t-shirts, hats, glasses and many other branded materials. We also use social media to communicate information, events, pictures, videos and other brand relevant information to consumers.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Events. We promote Broken 7 at on-premise events such as "happy hour" where consumers and on-premise staff will have the opportunity to learn about and sample Broken 7 products. In addition, we participate in Quebec's major beer festivals in order to directly connect with consumers to build brand awareness and consumer relationships.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Ambassador Program. We have established relationships with key influencers in the province of Quebec to represent the spirit of the brand. Key influencers are individuals who attend industry events and promote the Broken 7 brand at on-premise locations.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | In-store promotion. The Company has contracted out services to a contract brewer who is responsible for brewing, bottling, labelling and distributing Broken 7 bottled products and kegs. With the help of our contract brewer we distribute Broken 7 in retail stores, in Quebec, Canada. Such stores may have periodic promotions such as in-store displays, contest promotions, and price incentives.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Test product promotion. The Company has contracted out services to a contract brewer to help bring to market and test new recipes for Broken 7 in 50-liter kegs. With the help of our contract brewer we promote and test new recipes with our consumers to evaluate drinker interest.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seasonality
 
Our sales generally reflect a degree of seasonality, with the first and fourth quarters exhibiting low sales levels compared to the second and third quarters.

Competition
 
We compete in the craft brewing market as well as in the much larger alcoholic beverage market, which encompasses domestic and imported beers, flavored alcohol beverages, spirits, wine and ciders.
 
The craft beer segment is increasingly competitive due to the proliferation of small craft brewers, including contract brewers, and the large number of products offered by such brewers. Craft brewers have also encountered more competition as their peers expand distribution. Competition also varies by regional market. Depending on the local market preferences and distribution, we expect to encounter strong competition from microbreweries, regional specialty brewers and several national craft brewers that include Sleeman, Unibroue, McAuslan and Brasseurs du Nord. Because of the large number of participants and number of different products offered in this segment, the competition for packaged product placements and especially for draft beer placements has intensified. Also, many brewers will have greater financial and other resources than we have. We believe our competitive advantages include attractive labeling and bottle design, social media communication, and promotional events where samples of Broken 7 are made available.
 
We also compete against imported brands, such as Heineken, Corona Extra and Guinness which have significantly greater financial resources than we have. Although imported beers currently account for a greater share of the Canadian and U.S. beer market than craft beers, we believe that craft brewers possess certain competitive advantages over some importers, including lower transportation costs, no importation costs, proximity to and familiarity with local consumers, product freshness, eligibility for lower federal excise taxes and absence of currency fluctuations.
 
In response to the growth of the craft beer segment, many domestic national brewers have introduced fuller-flavored beers, including well-funded significant product launches in the wheat category. While these product offerings are intended to compete with craft beers, many of them are brewed according to methods used by these brewers in their other product offerings. The major national brewers, Molson Coors, Labatt, and Sleeman Breweries Ltd. have significantly greater financial resources than us and have access to a greater array of advertising and marketing tools to create product awareness. Although increased participation by national brewers increases competition for market share and can heighten price sensitivity within the craft beer segment, we believe that their participation may tend to increase advertising, distribution and consumer education and awareness of craft beers, and thus may ultimately contribute to further growth of this industry segment.
 
In the past several years, many major distilled spirits producers and national brewers have introduced flavored alcohol beverages in the higher-priced end of the malt beverage industry such as Smirnoff Ice and Mike's Hard Lemonade. We believe sales of these products, along with strong growth in the imported and craft beer segments of the malt beverage industry, contributed to an increase in the overall Canada and U.S. alcohol market. We believe that these products are particularly popular in regions and markets where we hope to sell our products.
 
We also believe that the competitive environment in Canada and the U.S. is such that large domestic brewers are trying to grow market share by purchasing small craft breweries.
 
Regulation
 
Any craft brewed beer that we market and sell in Canada will be subject to government regulations in Canada.
 
Food and Drugs Act
 
Health Canada is responsible for establishing standards for the safety and nutritional quality of all foods sold in Canada. The department exercises this mandate under the authority of the Food and Drugs Act and pursues its regulatory mandate under the Food and Drug Regulations.
 
All health and safety standards under the Food and Drug Regulations are enforced by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ("CFIA"). The CFIA is also responsible for the administration of non-health and safety regulations concerning food packaging, labeling and advertising.
 
The Food and Drug Regulations set out conditions regarding health, quality, composition and labeling requirements that would apply to breweries just as they would to other food and beverage manufacturers so that consumers will have confidence in the safety of the products they purchase.
  

8
 

The CFIA and the provincial liquor boards work together to ensure that alcoholic beverages, including beer, conform to Canadian safety standards (for alcohol content, toxins, etc.) under the Food and Drugs Act before being approved for sale in Canada.
 
Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act
 
The Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act, also enforced by the CFIA, requires that packaged foods either imported or made in Canada, must not bear any false or misleading information regarding their origin, quality, performance, net weight or quantity.
Mandatory Nutrition Labelling
 
On December 12, 2007, nutrition labelling became mandatory on most pre-packaged products. Exemptions (including beverages with an alcohol content of more than 0.5%) can be found in section [B.01.401(2)] of the Food And Drug Regulations. Products lose their exemption status if a health claim or nutrient content claim is made.
 
Agreement on Internal Trade
 
The Agreement on Internal Trade (under Chapter 10 - Alcoholic Beverages) has laid out a framework for non-discriminatory treatment of alcoholic beverages which has resulted in a number of inter-provincial trade barriers being addressed and efforts to avoid the creation of new barriers.
Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act
 
Along with federal regulation, Canadian breweries are regulated provincially. This provincial authority stems from a federal statute, the Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act, which requires that all liquor (including beer) imported into Canada be brought in through a provincial or territorial liquor board located within each province and territory in Canada. The provincial and territorial governments are also responsible for regulating and controlling the sale of liquor within their respective jurisdictions. Provincial and territorial governments, through their liquor control acts, issue licenses to brew or sell beer in their jurisdictions. Applications are available through provincial or territorial liquor control boards.
 
The provincial and territorial liquor boards collect federal and provincial duties and taxes on alcohol products, and then add their own mark-up prior to sale of the product. Advertising and marketing of beer are also closely controlled. However, these regulations vary between provinces and territories.
 
Most provinces in Canada have established minimum prices for all alcoholic beverages, including imports, to prevent the sale of alcohol at prices that would encourage over-consumption.
 
Excise Act
 
Taxes comprise both a federal excise duty, which is a federal levy imposed at the production stage on domestically-produced products such as spirits, beer and tobacco, and provincial ad valorem and volume taxes. These taxes and duties represent the single largest cost category to a brewing operation. Provincial sales tax and the federal goods and services tax are added at retail.
 
The federal excise tax system for alcoholic beverages presently in effect in Canada imposes duties on beer produced in Canada when it is shipped from the brewery to provincial liquor board warehouses or industry-owned stores. The excise duty on imported beer is calculated from the point where beer is imported and received into liquor board 'bonded' warehouses, but does not become due until the beer is shipped to the point of retail sale. This imposition point eliminates competitive distortions between domestic and imported beer, and between beer and other alcoholic beverages.
 
In Quebec, under the regulatory agency RACJ (regie d'alcool des courses et des jeux), a brewer's license includes the right to warehouse and distribute beer and to sell directly to licensed retailers such as on-premise accounts, retail and grocery chains.
 
We have a contract brewing agreement with a contract brewer. The contract brewers assume the responsibility to abide by all national and regional regulations. Our management works with the contract brewer to ensure we are in compliance with all regulations.

Intellectual Property
 
We have obtained Canadian trademark registration on our flagship brand Broken 7. We hope to obtain trademark registration for Broken 7 in other countries in the future.
 
We believe that our Broken 7 brand has substantial value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products. We are not currently aware of any infringing uses that will affect the development of our business or any prior claim to the trademarks that would prevent us from using our trademarks in our business.
Employees
 
We currently have two employees, Stephane Pilon, who is a full-time employee and one other, full-time promotional representative. Our other officer and director provides planning and organizational services for us on a part time basis.
Subsidiaries
 
We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries: Buckeye Oil & Gas (Canada), Inc., incorporated in the province of Alberta, Canada and Biere Brisset International, Inc., incorporated in the province of Quebec, Canada.
Subsequent Events
 
On March 2, 2018, BBII and Blue Spike entered into a Mutual Discharge Agreement (the "Termination Agreement"), pursuant to which the parties mutually agreed to terminate their Distribution Agreement, dated December 2, 2014, and amended on April 1, 2016 (the "Distribution Agreement"). The effective date of the Termination Agreement was March 2, 2018.
 
The parties chose to terminate the Distribution Agreement due to the Company's lack of sufficient sales Broken 7.
 
Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Company paid Blue Spike an aggregate of $5,979, including Blue Spike's outstanding invoices aggregating $3,700, sales commissions from September to December 2017 and applicable taxes.
 
There were no material early termination penalties incurred by the Company or BBII in connection with the termination of the Distribution Agreement.
