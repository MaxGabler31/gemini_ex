Product Lines
 
Hybrid Air Conditioners
 
e-Cond EVOTM
 
The Group first invented its line of eco-friendly portable air-conditioners under its e-Cond EVOTM brand in 2017.
 
The unit is an eco-friendly air-conditioning system with patent pending heat emission control system (“HECS”) technology, which regulates the temperature and volume of heat transferred from the air-conditioning system into the environment. This product employs an innovative hydro-refrigeration system (“HRS”) integrating evaporative cooling process with refrigeration cycle, reducing temperature of the output air by approximately 30% while achieving an optimal cooling performance of approximately 25 degree Celsius. The patent pending technology in the unit allows it to utilize up to 60% less energy than its traditional portable air-conditioning units. The portable air-conditioning systems also incorporate ionizer technology producing high concentrations of negative ions to purify the surrounding air of mold spores, pollen, pet dander, odors, cigarette smoke, bacteria, viruses, dust and other hazardous airborne particles.
 
The Company markets two models of the e-Cond EVOTM units: the Super King and the Outdoor King.

EvoAirTM
 
The Group continued to research on incorporating its patent pending heat emission control system (“HECS”) Technology as well as various other patent pending technologies into its product line, subsequently launching its EvoAirTM hybrid air-conditioners in 2021.
 
The Group’s EvoAirTM hybrid air-conditioners produced less heat emission through its patent pending HECS technology, as well as increased humidity and moisture of the expelled air to allow for a comfortable environment surrounding the external condenser unit during operation. EvoAirTM hybrid air-conditioners replaced traditional outdoor condenser units cooling coils with a Coolpressor Unit that incorporates various patent pending technologies. The Group’s patent pending HECS technology contributes to a reduction in waste heat produced by the Coolpressor unit by up to 25 degrees Celsius as well as reducing energy consumption by up to 20% compared to conventional air-conditioning units that utilizes long copper coils for cooling. The Coolpressor Unit increase the humidity of the expelled air by 20%, producing comfortable humidity levels in the surrounding environment around the Coolpressor Unit. This allows the unit to become a supplementary external-use cooling system by releasing moisturized air at approximately 28 degrees Celsius with a humidity of approximately 58% while operating under outdoor conditions. The significant decrease in waste heat and reduction in energy consumption play an important role in reducing harmful effects to the environment, in line with the Group’s philosophy of producing eco-friendly products.
 
Air-conditioning refrigerant is harmful to the environment. The EvoAirTM system utilizes the R32 refrigerant in its operation, which is 9% lower in density than the traditionally used R410A refrigerant found in various conventional air-conditioning systems, while maintaining approximately 43-50% higher latent heat vaporization and approximately 41% higher thermal conductivity when combined with the Group’s other patent-pending technologies. EvoAirTM’s system design also allows for a further reduction in refrigerant use of at least 30% compared to conventional air-conditioning systems with traditional long copper coils by increasing the efficiency of the heat transfer in the R32 refrigerant, in doing so, further increasing refrigerant efficiency.
 
The EvoAirTM hybrid air-conditioning system was awarded SGS International Certification in 2021.

The Air Conditioner Industry
 
Growing demand for cooling
 
Based on the latest report by the International Energy Agency 2018, in 2016 there were approximately 1.6 billion units of air conditioners in use globally, and China and the United States accounted for 36% and 23% of the total consumption, respectively. In addition, total air conditioner sales in the five year period ending December 31, 2020 have averaged approximately 111 million units each year.
 
Air-conditioners vary in energy efficiency and their usage lead to a global consumption of approximately 2,000 terawatt hours of electricity annually. In addition, almost 20% of all the electricity used in buildings is for cooling, accounting for 14% of average peak residential electricity demand globally.
 
The emerging economies are expected to use more air-conditioners as income levels rise. Of the 2.8 billion people living in the hottest parts of the world, only 8% currently own air-conditioning units compared to approximately 90% ownership in the United States and Japan. By 2050, India, China and Indonesia may account for 50% of the projected growth in energy use for space cooling.
 
Global Emissions from the use of Air Conditioners
 
The efficiency of air conditioners vary widely, in all major markets today, consumers are typically buying air conditioners whose average efficiencies are less than half of what is available. Carbon dioxide emissions from cooling systems have tripled since 1990 to 1,130 million tons in 2016, and local air pollutants caused by cooling systems have also increased. Greenhouse Gases produced include Carbon Dioxide and Climate Change:
 

● | Carbon dioxide is called a greenhouse gas because it absorbs infrared energy and remits this energy back in all directions. About half of that energy goes out into space and about half of it returns to Earth as heat, contributing to the greenhouse effect and climate change 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The four main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. Carbon dioxide accounts for about 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
● | About 30% of greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation, 25% come from the production of electricity, 23% comes from industrial production, 12% comes from commercial and residential sources and 10% comes from agriculture. 
● | Climate change could increase the occurrence and severity of weather events, such as heat waves, droughts and floods. These changes are likely to increase losses to property and crops and affect economic activity. 
● | The usage of air conditioners has a significant impact on the environment. Air-conditioners use chemical refrigerants, usually hydrofluorocarbons in their heat exchange systems. The hydrofluorocarbons contributes significantly to global warming if leaked to the atmosphere. 
● | The generation of the electricity to power the air conditioners also contribute to significant emissions, especially when fossil fuels are burnt to produce electricity. 

 
Urbanized areas have higher temperatures than less urbanized areas, contributing to heat islands. This is because urban areas usually have less greenery. Roads and buildings absorb and re-emit daytime heat more than forests and water bodies. As a result, urban daytime temperatures can reach approximately 1 to 7 degrees higher in Fahrenheit than the outlying areas and night-time temperatures can reach approximately 2 to 5 degrees higher in Fahrenheit. The use of air conditioners extract hot air to the outside of buildings. On high temperature days, the hot air emitted by air-conditioner units increases the outdoor temperature. This in turn increases the need for more cooling and creates a feedback loop. The use of air conditioners can increase outdoor urban temperatures by more than approximately 1 degree Celsius in some cities
 
Global Efforts to combat Climate Change and Global Warming
 
If the current rate of growth of energy use by air conditioners continues, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) predicts that by 2050, global energy usage for space cooling would triple to 6,200 terra watts. This would triple the amount of carbon dioxide emissions and heavy investments in electricity infrastructure to meet peak electricity demand. This could cause severe financial strain on emerging economies.
 
Over the years, countries around the world have come together to support policies to combat climate change. However, obtaining consensus has been challenging because of political and national circumstances. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which entered into force on 1 January 2019, help protect the climate by phasing down high global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are commonly used as refrigerants. Promoting the energy efficiency of cooling technology can also significantly increase climate benefits.
 

● | From October 31 to November 12, 2021, the 26th annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) was held in Glasgow, Scotland. The objectives of COP26 were: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
i. Countries were called out to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to cap the increase in global temperatures below 1.5°C from current levels;
 
ii. To protect and restore ecosystems and habitats and build resilient infrastructures to withstand climate change;
 
iii. Developed nations to mobilize $100bn in climate finance per year for poorer nations; and
 
iv. Parties of COP26 to finalize the agreement and rules for action and monitoring.
 
The Role of Air conditioners Efficiency in combating Climate Change
 
Intuitively, the more energy efficient air-conditioners are, the less electricity they would consume, and less fossil fuels would be burnt to produce electricity. This would lead to less carbon dioxide emissions which could reduce global warming.
 
The EIA highlighted one area where policy action could deliver substantial energy savings quickly — by making air conditioners equipment more efficient. Through stricter minimum energy performance standards and other measure such as labelling, the average energy efficiency of the stock of air conditioners globally could more than double in efficiency between now and 2050. This could reduce cooling-related energy demand to 3,400 terawatts in 2050 compared to 6,200 terawatts if efficiency remained at current levels. The 45% reduction in energy usage or 2,800 terawatts could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1,582 megatons annually. This scenario was called the Efficient Cooling Scenario by EIA.

In addition, the use of less electricity because of more efficient air conditioners greatly reduces the need to build new generation capacity to meet peak electricity demand. In the Efficient Cooling Scenario, there would not be a need to build additional capacity deliver the 1,300 gigawatts of power with more efficient air conditioners. This is equivalent to all the coal-fired power generation in China and India today. In addition, the cumulative infrastructure, fuel and operating costs savings amounted to $2.9 trillion from 2017 to 2050. This means 45% lower electricity costs for everyone as well, compared to if there were no efficiency improvements in air conditioners
 

In 2018, approximately 111 million units of air conditioners were sold globally of which approximately 87% were residential units and approximately 13% were commercial units. The CAGR from 2012 to 2018 was approximately 2.2%. China was the largest consumer of air conditioners globally and it accounted for approximately 40% of all air conditioners sales. Asia (ex-Japan and China) had the highest CAGR of approximately 5.3% from 2012 to 2018 followed by Africa at approximately 3.9% CAGR. The global air conditioners systems market was valued at approximately $106.6 billion in 2020 and was expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 6.3% from 2021 to 2028. The market size for that of China was approximately $37.0 billion in 2020 and was expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 7.4%. The major air conditioners manufacturers globally come from Japan, South Korea, China and the USA. Daikin was the leading player globally with approximately $20.3 billion of revenues from the heating, ventilation and air conditioners segment in Financial Year ended 2020.
