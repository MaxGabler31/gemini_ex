Item 1. Business
Who We Are
 Mister Car Wash, Inc. is the largest national car wash brand offering express exterior and interior cleaning services to customers across 396 car wash locations in 21 states, as of December 31, 2021. Founded in 1996, we employ an efficient, repeatable and scalable process, which we call the “Mister Experience,” to deliver a clean, dry and shiny car every time. The core pillars of the “Mister Experience” are providing the highest quality car wash and ensuring the experience is quick and convenient. We offer a monthly subscription program, Unlimited Wash Club ® ("UWC"), as a flexible, quick and convenient option for customers to keep their cars clean. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1.7 million vehicles that had an active UWC membership (collectively "UWC Members"), representing 64% of our total wash sales and 72% of our total wash volume in 2021. Our scale and more than 25 years of innovation has allowed us to drive operating efficiencies and invest in training, infrastructure and technology that improve speed of service, quality and sustainability and realize strong financial performance.
 Our purpose is simple: Inspire People to Shine®. This starts with our people. We attract and retain a strong pool of talent by investing in their training and development through our specialized programs and our MisterLearn training platform that allows us to develop and promote entry-level team members to leadership roles. As a result, our team members are highly engaged and deliver memorable experiences to our customers. We have proven our people-first approach is scalable and has enabled us to develop a world class team, comprised of both internally developed talent and external hires from top service organizations. We believe our purpose-driven culture is critical to our success.
 We believe Mister Car Wash offers an affordable, feel-good experience, enjoyed by all who value a clean, dry and shiny car. Our car wash experience has broad demographic appeal as the price of our typical base exterior car wash is approximately $8. As we grow and to serve the approximately 273 million registered vehicles in the United States as of the end of 2021, we are dedicated to putting our team members first and delivering a consistent, convenient and high-quality car wash experience at scale.
 Products and Services
 Our car wash locations consist of two formats: (a) Express Exterior Locations (313 locations as of December 31, 2021) and (b) Interior Cleaning Locations (83 locations as of December 31, 2021). All locations offer express exterior wash packages and have exterior-only lanes. Every wash includes our proprietary T3 Cleaning Conditioner (gently removes dirt and grime, cleans and refreshes the exterior of the vehicle), Wheel Cleaner (high pH, soft-metal safe, foaming chemistry applied to wheel and tire through targeted applicators, removes dirt and grime to prepare for subsequent applications) and Dynamic Dry system (pH charged rinse, optimized blower configuration and, in select locations, soft cloth technology to deliver a spot-free and drier car).
Express Exterior Locations
 Express Exterior Locations offer self-drive exterior cleaning services and include free vacuums available for customer use. Customers purchase a wash or sign-up for a UWC membership through sales kiosks or assisted by team members and remain in their vehicle through the tunnel and wash process. Customers have the option to use free self-serve vacuums at any time before or after their exterior wash.
Interior Cleaning Locations
 Interior Cleaning Locations offer exterior and interior cleaning services, including vacuuming by our team members. Customers purchase a wash or sign-up for a UWC membership through sales kiosks or assisted by team members and either remain in their vehicle through the tunnel and wash process or wait in the lobby. Customers who purchase interior cleaning services have their vehicles vacuumed and cleaned by Mister team members.
Express Exterior Wash Packages
 We offer four express exterior wash packages. Additional options within the wash packages include waxes and protectants that are applied during the wash process in the tunnel. These services include our proprietary chemistry

and application systems: HotShine Carnauba Wax (waterfall wax application for enhanced shine), Repel Shield (silicone based to provide water repellency), Platinum Seal (extends life of shine and protection), Wheel Polish (protects wheels against pitting from road grime and provides shine), Underbody Wash (cleans beneath the vehicle) and Tire Shine (cleans and shines tires).
 Interior Cleaning Wash Packages and Services
 At select locations, we offer interior cleaning services in addition to express exterior washes. Interior cleaning services are added to an express exterior wash and include interior vacuuming, window cleaning, dusting of dashboard and hard surfaces and a hand towel dry of the exterior by our team members.
Unlimited Wash Club
 In 2003, we established UWC as a monthly subscription service to develop deeper loyalty with customers and create a highly attractive recurring revenue stream. UWC Members are billed automatically each month on the anniversary date of their sign-up and membership is tracked through RFID technology.
 We offer various membership options for both express exterior and interior cleaning services. As of December 31, 2021, over 95% of our UWC Members held a UWC membership for exterior cleaning services, of which a majority of our UWC Members are in our Platinum Exterior plan, priced at $29.99 per month.
 UWC membership benefits include access to all Mister locations, dedicated member lanes, a convenient and contactless experience, and flexible membership plans. Members can easily manage their membership through our online account management platform, where they can make plan changes, including cancelling a plan, access visit history and update credit card information.
 


UWC has helped to diversify our sales by providing an attractive recurring revenue stream and a steady sales flow, providing stable demand through varying seasons and weather. In 2021, a typical UWC Member averaged over 30 visits per year and often chose off-peak hours to visit our locations which has helped smooth wash demand throughout the day. Management continues to evaluate strategies for further improvement of the UWC experience.
 Our Customers
 We serve a diverse mix of customers, which include individual retail customers, UWC Members and business accounts. Our Business Account Program offers the convenience of washing all the vehicles in a fleet while maintaining one simple account and payment. Given the broad appeal of our services, we have a wide variety of retail customers spanning a broad set of demographics. The portfolio of cars serviced across our locations is diverse and represents a balance across new and old cars and across all vehicle price points. Our customer service, convenient locations and easy-to-manage membership programs have helped position our locations as the “go-to” destinations for our customers’ car wash needs.
Markets
 We are the largest national car wash brand and have developed extensive resources and capabilities over our 25-year history. Our scale, consistency of operations at every location and culture of continuous improvement have allowed us to develop an efficient and high-quality customer experience with every wash.


We believe our key differentiators include:
 •Unified National Brand. We lead with a unified national brand and customer experience. As soon as feasible following acquisition, we rebrand all locations to “Mister” and undertake capital investment at each to deliver a consistent, high-quality experience. Recently, we completed a company-wide exterior and interior remodeling program to align branding across our footprint. We believe our unified national brand builds customer loyalty and is a catalyst for continued new customer acquisition and UWC membership growth. No matter which location they choose, our customers receive a consistent “Mister Experience.”
 •Robust Training & Development Programs and Talent Pipeline. We have developed and scaled a strong talent pipeline beginning with our robust, proprietary training and development programs, and our service delivery model. Over the last three years, we have also reduced by approximately 50% team member turnover in the first 30 days of employment. We believe our robust training and development process results in team members who are equipped to maintain the highest levels of operational excellence and consistently deliver the “Mister Experience” to our customers.
 •Dedicated Regional Support Infrastructure. Our significant regional support infrastructure includes over 65 regional managers, over 50 regional support staff (recruiting, training, HR, and safety) and over 200 facility maintenance staff, each as of December 31, 2021. Our regional managers support on average six general managers, allowing them to focus on coaching, mentorship and delivering consistently high standards. We employ approximately one maintenance staff for every two locations, which has allowed us to achieve significant uptime. We believe the strength and depth of our regional support infrastructure supports our ability to integrate acquisitions efficiently and successfully and to open greenfield locations in existing and new markets.
 •Sophisticated Technology and Proprietary Products. We employ sophisticated chemical control systems, automatic scanning RFID tags for UWC Members, our proprietary Unity Chemistry system, and patented HotShine Carnauba Wax application system. We believe our products and technology result in a superior clean relative to our competitors, driving customer satisfaction and member retention.
 •Strategic Market Density “Network Effect.” We generally have multiple locations in a specific market and take advantage of our local market density to generate a strong “network effect.” We believe our network offers incremental value to UWC Members by allowing them to utilize multiple locations at their convenience. It also enables us to better leverage marketing spend, build a local talent pipeline and optimize regional support infrastructure.
 Key Growth Drivers
 Grow Our UWC Members to Drive Predictable Earnings Growth and Higher Annual Customer Spend
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow UWC penetration further in core, acquired and greenfield locations. In 2021, we increased overall UWC penetration from 62% to 64% of total wash sales. We estimate that the average UWC Member spends more than four times the retail car wash consumer, providing us an opportunity to significantly increase our sales as penetration increases. At both new greenfield and acquired locations, we have developed proven processes for growing UWC membership per location.
In addition to enhancing the value proposition to our existing UWC Members through our ongoing focus on operational excellence, we intend to employ the following processes to convert additional retail customers to UWC Members and grow our UWC membership:
 •Expand Our Sales Channels. We are focused on making it easier for our members to sign-up for and manage their UWC subscription membership, as we believe this will allow us to attract a broader membership base. In December 2020, we introduced our digital sign-up platform, which has allowed us to add new customers and convert existing retail customers into UWC Members.
 •Educate Customers on Value Proposition: We believe that customer education on the benefits of UWC membership is critical to the successful acquisition and retention of new members, and we specifically train our team members on program knowledge and education. We are also investing in upgraded technology to engage in targeted marketing communication with members.
Build Upon Our Established Success in Opening Greenfield Locations
 During 2021, we successfully opened 17 greenfield locations and expect to drive the majority of our location growth through greenfield locations on a go-forward basis. We have developed a proven process for opening new greenfield locations, from site selection to post-opening local marketing initiatives, which has driven our strong greenfield performance consistently over time. In order to identify, evaluate and target the most attractive locations we employ a data-driven approach that utilizes a combination of predictive analytics produced by a multi-point, proprietary site selection matrix by trade area, with on-the-ground insights from our experienced real estate and operations team. We plan to continue material investment in this growth arm of our business and have a strong development pipeline for future locations in existing and adjacent markets nationwide.
Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions in Highly Fragmented Industry
 We will continue to employ a disciplined approach to acquisitions, carefully selecting high quality locations that meet the specific criteria of a potential Mister Car Wash site. We have a proven track record of location growth through acquisitions, having successfully integrated over 100 acquisitions during our history.
 As soon as feasible after an acquisition, we make significant investments to upgrade and integrate each acquired location. To improve each site, we install our proprietary Unity Chemistry system, engineer process flow optimization and add UWC Member lanes. We rebrand the look and feel of acquired locations, integrate POS systems and standardize operating procedures to create one unified "Mister" brand experience for our customers across all our locations. We also elevate our team-member experience at acquired locations by offering rewarding benefits and compensation packages, labor training initiatives and growth opportunities. The combination of these investments in throughput, the customer experience and people has enabled us to drive material performance improvement and EBITDA growth within two years of acquisition.
 Drive Scale Efficiencies and Robust Free Cash Flow Generation
 We will continue to utilize our scale to drive operating leverage as our business grows. As we open new locations and maximize throughput at our existing locations through our ongoing focus on operational excellence, we will have an opportunity to generate meaningful efficiencies of scale. These efficiencies include leveraging our research and development and technology infrastructure across our growing network, leveraging our training and marketing programs over an increasing revenue base, optimizing our regional support infrastructure and overhead costs, and leveraging insights and analytics from our growing consumer database to drive targeted marketing and customer acquisition. As a result of our attractive EBITDA margins and relatively low maintenance capital expenditures per location, we expect to generate robust free cash flow that we intend to use to fund our greenfield expansion strategy and opportunistic acquisitions.
 Marketing
We lead with a unified national brand and large, clear signage to maximize visibility and curb appeal. To acquire, convert and retain our customers at a local level, we use a mix of geo-targeted traditional media, digital media, search engine marketing, earned and owned media, all with the goal of emphasizing the core “Mister” value proposition: number of locations, convenience, speed and the benefits of the UWC program.
 We have a mobile app and online membership management tool, making it easy and accessible for customers to engage with us, purchase washes and update membership programs. We generally have multiple locations in a specific market and take advantage of our local market density to generate a strong “network effect” enabling us to better leverage our marketing spend.
 Our Competition
 The car wash industry is highly fragmented, and we compete with a variety of operators. Competitors include national, regional and local independent car wash operators, and other retailers (including gasoline and convenience retailers and mass market merchandise stores), each of which offer car washes. We believe the core competitive factors in our industry are convenience, price, quality, brand awareness, speed, and customer satisfaction. We believe our scale allows us to compete effectively with respect to each of these factors.
Resources
 Our Proprietary Products and Advanced Technology
 Through continuous research and development, Mister Car Wash has formulated a balanced wash process that factors in conveyor length, line speed, water quality, mechanical equipment, ambient temperature and soil conditions. Our Unity Chemistry system, a proprietary, color-coded chemical blending system, allows us to customize our chemical blend at the store level and adjust for factors such as length of the tunnel, equipment type, water quality and unique environmental conditions such as pollen, bugs and salt. The program helps save costs for each car wash location as chemicals can be mixed on an as-needed basis and adapted for the specific characteristics of the locations based on seasonal weather patterns and local environmental conditions.
Our industry-leading systems, including the Dynamic Dry system and patented HotShine Carnauba Wax application system, give consistent product delivery each time while reducing waste. A dedicated research and development team is responsible for car wash processes, equipment and technology improvements. The team tests new products, processes and ideas in select markets before rolling out improvements and changes across the broader platform.
 At our locations, we use proprietary cleaning products that are intended to optimize our drying and cleaning processes. Our signature products include the HotShine Carnauba Wax, Repel Shield, Platinum Seal and Wheel Polish.
 Suppliers and Distribution
 We maintain long-term relationships with our key vendors. We believe our scale and large purchase quantities provide us significant leverage in securing competitive pricing. Our key purchases include car wash equipment and parts and wash chemicals.
 We employ rebates and pricing reductions based on the volume of purchases with several of our vendors. While we maintain a limited stock of parts and supplies for repairs and maintenance, most equipment, chemicals, and other supplies are purchased on an as-needed basis, which generally are shipped directly from the vendors to our locations. We have deep industry knowledge and maintain relationships with previous and prospective vendors to quickly address issues that may arise with our current supply chain.
 Mister Car Wash owns the formulas for the proprietary chemical blends used in our car washing process which are blended by a third-party under an extendable contract that includes component level price transparency to limit price increases based on underlying commodity fluctuations. We have not entered, at this time, into hedges of our raw material costs, but we may do so in the future.
 In 2018, we entered into an agreement with a supplier of a comprehensive suite of hardware, software, and management systems for our car wash locations which better track our membership and customer loyalty programs, streamline our operations and enhance our ability to track costs.
 Intellectual Property and Trademarks
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 25 trademark registrations and applications, including registrations for “Mister Car Wash,” “Hotshine,” “Mister Hotshine” and “Unlimited Wash Club.” As of December 31,2021, we held one U.S. patent and one foreign patent. Our patents are expected to expire between 2022 and 2025.
 We have also registered the Internet domain name: “mistercarwash.com”.
 We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position, and, therefore, we devote resources to the protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights.
 Seasonality
 Our 21-state geographic diversity limits the weather impacts of a specific region on overall performance. While UWC Members pay on a monthly basis, irrespective of the weather and their usage frequency, we do experience a large majority of sales of UWC memberships during the first six months of the year. As our UWC sales have grown to comprise more than approximately 64% and 62% of our total wash sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, our financial performance has become more predictable.
Government Regulation
 The Company and its business operations are subject to various laws and regulations, including those governing labor and employment including minimum wages and paid sick time, workplace safety, employee and public health including COVID-19, consumer protection, recurring debit and credit card charges, information security, consumer protection, data privacy, marketing and advertising, environmental protection and compliance, including recycling, waste and water usage, zoning and land use, taxation and public company compliance. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.
Labor, Employment and Safety
 We are subject to a variety of labor, employment and safety laws, including the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various other federal and state laws, governing matters including minimum and unpaid wages, tip pooling, overtime, workplace safety and other working conditions. We are also subject to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and other federal and state laws and regulations relating to workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters.
Data Privacy and Security
 We are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to the privacy and security of consumer, customer and employee personal information. These laws often require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of data (such as personal data), and/or impose specific requirements relating to the collection or processing of such data. We are also subject to various state laws relating to notice requirements in the event of security breaches. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Information Technology and Data Privacy - We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively impact our results of operations or reputation.”
Consumer Protection
 We are subject to a number of federal regulations relating to the use of debit and credit cards, such as the Electronic Funds Act and the Truth in Lending Act of 1968, which provide guidelines and parameters for payment processing on debit cards and credit cards, respectively, and certain state regulations relating to automatic renewal, including the California Business & Professional Code Section 17601-17606, as amended, which provides requirements we must follow for the automatic renewal of subscription fees such as those charged to our UWC Members.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
 Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to ownership and operation of underground storage tanks; the release or discharge of regulated materials into the air, water and soil; the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of regulated materials, including wastes; the exposure of persons to hazardous materials; remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater; and the health and safety of employees dedicated to such transportation and storage activities.
 Environmental laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:
 •requiring the acquisition of certifications, registrations, permits or other authorizations or the provision of financial assurances in connection with the transportation, storage and sale of hazardous substances and other regulated activities;
 •requiring remedial action to mitigate releases of petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes caused by our operations or attributable to former operators;
 •requiring capital expenditures to comply with environmental pollution control, cathodic protection or release detection requirements;
 •enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations; and


•imposing substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.
 Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining or otherwise curtailing future operations in a particular area. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes have been released or disposed of into the environment. Moreover, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims for nuisance, personal injury and property or natural resource damage allegedly caused by the release of petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes into the environment.
 The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment, and thus changes in environmental laws and regulations that impose more stringent and costly petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements on us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and minimize the costs of such compliance, but there is no assurance that our expectations will be realized.
 For further discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Governmental Regulation – Our locations are subject to certain environmental laws and regulations."
Human Capital
 People are at the center of everything we do and are the heartbeat of our company. As a company we are centered around our purpose of Inspiring People to Shine, and that starts with our team members. In order to recruit and retain the most qualified team members in the industry, we focus on treating our team members well by paying them competitive wages, offering them attractive benefit packages, offering robust training and development opportunities, and providing a strong operational support infrastructure with opportunities for upward mobility. We believe satisfied employees are more productive, are more likely to have a positive impact on employees around them and are more likely to deliver great customer service.
Team Members
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 6,750 team members across our workforce in the United States comprised of 6,140 store-level, 75 regional leaders, 54 regional support, 207 facilities maintenance and installation, and 275 headquarters team members.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We strive to build and maintain strong and positive relations with our employees.
Caring for Team Members
 We believe that happy and well-cared-for team members bring their best selves to work. Our benefits package includes offerings to cater to our diverse population of team members, which includes individuals at different stages of life. Our benefits offerings include paid time off for both full-time and part-time team members, progressive and affordable health benefits which include member advocacy and several no-cost, virtual health programs focused on general health as well as chronic conditions, mental health programs, six weeks of paid parental leave, 401(k) matching, personal finance education, tuition reimbursement, and company-paid disability coverage. Additionally, our hiring and promotion practices are designed to drive diversity and inclusion awareness so our employees can bring their authentic selves to work.


As of December 31, 2021, our workforce racial diversity mirrored diversity qualities seen in the United States population. In a historically male-dominated industry, 31% of our team members are female, and we increased female representation in leadership by 17% in 2021 with a strong pipeline of up-and-coming female leaders in our Manager In Training and Assistant Manager positions. Additionally, 59% of our overall workforce and 44% of our leadership are made up of people of color.
 During 2021, we raised average wages for non-managerial hourly workers by approximately 7%. Our average, non-management hourly wage was $14.71 as of December 31, 2021. We also established the Mister Cares Foundation in April 2020, a 501(c)(3), with the mission of providing financial assistance to our team members that face unforeseen hardship.
 Throughout the course of 2021, our overall turnover decreased by 4% and turnover among our team members with greater than one year of tenure was reduced by 13%.
 Offering Robust Training and Development and Opportunities for Advancement
 We seek to attract and retain a strong pool of talent by investing in our employees’ training and development via our Mister Learn training platform that enables us to promote qualified team members from the frontlines to leadership roles. As of December 31, 2021, our general managers had an average tenure of six years with the Company, and 93% had been promoted from within the organization.
 Our focus on developing a world-class team is reinforced by our rigorous training programs. We develop and deploy curriculums specifically built for each position, including both initial and ongoing training as well as hands-on mentoring opportunities. Our 360 Service Model cross trains team members to excel at multiple positions within a car wash location, and our MisterLearn learning management system, inclusive of more than 150 computer-based training courses is readily accessible to all team members.
 In 2021, we launched our Operations Leadership Program and Maintenance Apprentice Program to ensure a strong pipeline of fully trained individuals to fuel our strategic growth objectives and offer rewarding career opportunities for our team members. These internally developed comprehensive training programs teach leadership skills and expectations for those who desire to become future leaders, and Mister-specific facilities maintenance expertise to those who prefer a skilled trades path.
Our team members are highly engaged and deliver consistently memorable experiences to our customers. We have proven our people-first approach is scalable and this has enabled us to develop an exceptional team, comprised of both internally developed talent and external hires from top service organizations. We believe our purpose-driven culture is critical to our industry-leading sales productivity.
