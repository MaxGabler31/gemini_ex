--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The foundation of our business is our deep technical expertise across RFID, smart card technology, and physical security technologies.  Our close customer relationships and analytics platforms allow us to develop customer-relevant products and applications.  This is all underpinned by our core value of uncompromising quality.
 To deliver these solutions, we have organized our operations into four reportable business segments, principally by product families: Premises, Identity, Credentials, and All Other. 
 3

Premises
 The Premises segment includes our products and solutions to address the premises security and building intelligence market for government and enterprise, including access control, video surveillance, analytics and intelligence solutions.
 The foundation of our physical security platform has been the Hirsch line of controllers including the advanced MX line, Hirsch's Velocity management software and a wide range of integrations that provide Velocity/MX’s unique flexibility across a wide range of industries and implementations.  We have further extended our physical access platform with our Identiv Connected Physical Access Manager (“ICPAM”) software, derived from Cisco’s Physical Access Manager (“CPAM”) system and available in partnership with Cisco.  
 In February 2018, we acquired 3VR Security, Inc. (“3VR”), a video technology and analytics company. With the acquisition, we have added the 3VR video security and analytics platform, which is a natural complement to our Hirsch line.  Nearly all customers for access control are customers for video security, and vice versa.  Additionally, the events and data generated by both platforms combine to create what we believe to be uniquely valuable information for our customers to provide frictionless yet robust security.  3VR’s platform is architected as an analytics system, proven across applications in the retail, banking, and other vertical markets, and valuable to our traditional Hirsch and ICPAM markets in government, education, critical infrastructure, transportation and others.  Additionally, we sell either individual components or complete bundled solutions which can include any or all among software, edge controllers, multi-door panels, access readers, access cards, 3VR appliances and other components.
 Our modular Hirsch MX controllers are designed to be scalable, allowing customers to start with a small system and expand over time. Hirsch MX controllers can operate autonomously, whether as a single controller or as part of a networked system with Velocity software. The Hirsch Velocity software platform enables centralized management of access and security operations across an organization, including control of doors, gates, turnstiles, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a robust audit trail.
 To our price/performance/quality-leading commercial offerings, we have added what we believe to be the highest performance, lowest per-door cost access control system for the U.S. federal government security mandate known as the Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management (“FICAM”) architecture.  This brings all of the advantages above into the next generation of physical security for the U.S. government departments and agencies to achieve Federal Information Processing Standard (“FIPS”) 201 compliance.
 Our TouchSecure (“TS”) door readers provide unique features to support a wide range of security standards. We support the majority of legacy card credentials with a robust next-generation platform that can help companies migrate to more secure credentials and technologies, including smart cards, near field communication ("NFC") and government-issued credentials including Common Access Card (“CAC”), Personal Identification Verification (“PIV”), Personal Identification Verification – Interoperable (“PIV-I”) and others. Additionally, our Scramblepad readers employ numerical scrambling on the keypad to protect access codes from being stolen as they are entered, and providing both secure two-factor authentication and convenient alternative-factor access.
 In addition to this solution offering, in 2017, we launched Identiv Global Services (”IGS”), a service offering with a comprehensive catalog of end-to-end services that facilitates customer success and drives deeper adoption of the Identiv product portfolio.  IGS supports customers throughout their premises security lifecycle from system design, to deployment to managed services.  IGS experts enable customers to address today’s complex security and IT systems interoperability requirements, and helps them achieve a tailor-made set-up.
 Identity
 Our Identity products include smart card readers, which includes a broad range of contact, contactless, portable and mobile smart card readers, tokens and terminals that are utilized around the world to enable logical access (i.e., PC, network or data access) and security and identification applications, such as national ID, payment, e-Health and e-Government.
 With over 20 years of smart card reader, application and token experience as Identiv and previously as SCM Microsystems, we are known for our expertise in this complex ecosystem.  We combine our deep technical expertise with an optimized supply chain, to provide what we believe to be the most optimal, cost-effective and high-quality smart card-based products.  Whether Identiv branded products, original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) branded, or embedded chips or modules, our position is as the trusted business solution provider for all users and issuers of smart cards and embedded-chip applications.
 4

Credentials
 Our Credentials segment include NFC and RFID products, including inlays and inlay­based and other cards, labels, tags and stickers, as well as other radio frequency (“RF”) and integrated circuits (“IC”) components and are generally grouped into access cards and transponders. Our TS Cards product line, we believe, is the first complete solution to allow customers to pay only for the most basic low-frequency proximity access technology while having the ability to evolve to the higher-security high-frequency and highest-security public key infrastructure (“PKI”) based access credentials.  This product line exemplifies our values:  we place no burden on our customers, instead providing what we believe to be the most cost-effective solution to their basic needs; and then delivering within this platform the ability for them to move to higher-level needs and capabilities, when they want, when they are ready and when they will realize economic and experience benefits. 
 Our transponder products span the full range of high frequency (“HF”) and ultra-high frequency (“UHF”) technologies.  Our differentiation is analogous to application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICS”) in the semiconductor market.  We leverage our flexible platform, our deep technical expertise and our infrastructure and supply chain to deliver solutions optimized for our customers’ business goals.  We believe we are more responsive, more flexible, more experienced in business-optimized solutions and have a better track record of sustained delivery of solution-specific, high-quality RFID devices than our competitors.  These products are manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility in Singapore and are used in a diverse range of physical applications, including electronic entertainment such as virtual reality (“VR”), games, loyalty cards, mobile payment systems, transit and event ticketing, brand authenticity from pharmaceuticals to consumer goods, hospital resource management, cold-chain management and many others.  
 Leveraging our expertise in RFID, physical access and physical authentication, we are developing new solutions to extend our platforms across a wide variety of physical use cases.  The next major opportunity in our connected world is the IoT, which fundamentally is about physical things.  We believe our core strength in physical access and physical instrumentation markets, our well-established platforms and our deep knowledge of the relevant technologies, position us well in this growth market. 
 All Other 
 The All Other segment included legacy product lines, such as Chipdrive and Digital Media readers. No revenues from this segment were generated in 2017 and no revenues are expected to be generated in future periods.  In the fourth quarter of 2016, we phased out our Digital Media product lines and discontinued our Chipdrive product line. 
 For a discussion of our net revenue by segment and geographic location, see Note 9, Segment Reporting and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Market Strategy
 Our corporate priority is to drive revenue growth by leveraging our core technology expertise and our enduring customer relationships, as well as our significant experience addressing solutions across multiple markets, including government, transportation, healthcare, education, banking, retail, critical infrastructure and others.  Our common advantages across all of our segments, in addition to a shared set of technologies and supply chain, is our more than 20 years of expertise and sustained reputation as the go-to source for what we believe to be the top-quality, most reliable, most cost-effective solution.  We drive an intense commitment to our customers, to ensure we are delivering business-supporting solutions to them and honoring a straightforward, respectful, trustworthy and business-based relationship at all times, and for a long time.  In all of our segments we have a long track-record within the industry, and this position as a trusted advisor, supplier and business partner.
 In our Premises segment, we believe that our more than 20 years’ experience delivering physical security solutions to U.S. Government customers has provided us with significant expertise and a quality reputation.  Our products enable compliance with federal directives and standards implemented over the past decade, including Homeland Security Presidential Directive (“HSPD”) 12 and FIPS 201, which defines a common standard known as the PIV credential, used by all U.S. Government employees and contractors. We are a leading supplier of physical access control solutions to both federal and state government customers, including agencies within the Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, the FBI, U.S. Marshall and many others.  As a pioneering adopter of physical security technologies and protocols employed on a large scale, the U.S. Government continues to demand the best of breed, which we have been delivering to an increasing range of agencies and departments.
 We develop and sell integrated physical security solutions to government and enterprise customers worldwide. Our systems integrate access control, video surveillance, intrusion detection, building management and other network-based systems using a wide range of access cards, including PIV cards, smart cards, RFID cards and biometrics in order to successfully secure facilities and resources.

Our offerings include Hirsch MX controllers, Velocity management software, ICPAM software edge controller systems.  These combined with door readers and access cards provide scalable systems, allowing customers to start with a small system and expand over time. Hirsch and ICPAM controllers can operate autonomously, whether as a single controller or as part of a networked system with Velocity or ICPAM software. The Hirsch Velocity software platform enables centralized management of access and security operations across an organization, including control of doors, gates, turnstiles, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a robust audit trail. Our door readers provide unique features to support a number of security environments and standards. For example, our ScramblePad readers employ numerical scrambling on the keypad to protect access codes from being stolen as they are entered. Our TS readers support the majority of card credentials with a robust platform that can help companies expand to encompass other credentials and technologies, including smart cards, NFC, and mobile government-issued cards.
 With our recent acquisition of 3VR, our new offerings include video intelligence solutions which provide a single platform for real-time security and customer insights, enabling organizations to protect employees, customers and assets as well as improve store operations and shopping experiences. Our new open, pluggable platform leverages existing customer infrastructure and allows customers to expand their systems’ capabilities seamlessly.
 Physical Security and Analytics
 As mentioned above, in February 2018, we acquired 3VR. Our new offerings include video intelligence solutions which provide a single platform for real-time security and customer insights, enabling organizations to protect employees, customers and assets as well as improve store operations and shopping experiences. Our new open, pluggable platform leverages existing customer infrastructure and allows customers to expand their systems’ capabilities seamlessly.  In addition, our analytics platform is core to our overall strategy. Security technologies are generating vast amounts of real-time data, which in practice has often been unmanageable. That has meant a limited capability to show risks in advance, and that manual processing of vast amounts of data has relegated responses to post-facto, forensic uses. Even those uses have been limited because of the scale of the security data and the limitations of the existing platforms to effectively manage and turn it into useful, actionable information.
 Our systems have already been demonstrated to solve these problems for specific security applications, retail loss prevention, ATM fraud, loitering and other security risks.  The same analytics are being used to turn this security data into business improvement applications.  Since the infrastructure investment has been made for security purposes, costs for incremental systems to apply the data can be limited.  We are doing this in such applications as queue line management, heat mapping, customer service, personnel training and other areas, which we believe will expand both within vertical applications and horizontally. 
 Since virtually all access control customers deploy video security, we believe the opportunity for a combined product with robust feature sets represents a substantial portion of the overall market, and makes the system more effective. Access control systems manage the most critical event in a security system:  Access granted or access denied.  Access control systems are based on rigorous identification of trusted people within an organization or a community.  This provides the two critical ingredients for successful video security:  A list of already-trusted people, as well as alarms and events to focus video attention and analytics where they are most relevant. Without this leverage, video is a massive data stream that is often unmanageable in real-time and cumbersome to sort through forensically.
 As the market understands this need, some of the most progressive video companies have developed their own access control systems.  And vice versa, some access control companies have developed video capabilities. We believe this approach of extending from one solution to the other has resulted in solutions with limited capabilities. 
 By combining access control and video security solutions, which are both strong on their own, we believe we are establishing a comprehensive solution for our customers. First, our 3VR platform has been architected from the beginning as an analytics platform, not just as a video streaming and viewing system.  Second, by deeply combining access authorization databases and events with video system events, a much narrower solution set is created, since authorized events and people are pre-known, and the remaining events are much easier to tag and respond to as possible security issues. 
 In addition to our core products, we have a range of product initiatives designed to leverage leading technology advances across mobile, biometric, machine-learning and other areas, to provide convenient, frictionless, low-cost yet highly secure physical access.   We invest independently and in partnership with other leading technology companies in these emerging aspects of physical security and analytics platforms. 
 
Leveraging Underlying Technologies across Smart Cards and RFID
 In addition to providing secure and frictionless premises solutions, we are leveraging our underlying technology capabilities across a number of product and applications.
 6

In our Identity segment, we have over 20 years’ experience as a leading global supplier of smart card reader technologies. We offer a broad range of contact, contactless and mobile smart card readers, tokens and terminals that are utilized around the world to enable access and security applications, such as national ID cards, payment and eHealth and eGovernment. We have supplied millions of smart card readers to the Department of Defense and other federal agencies. To support the growing demand for solutions that provide secure access via mobile devices, sometimes known as “bring your own device” (“BYOD”), our mobile readers allow users to securely authenticate using iOS™ or Android™ devices, when they present standard credentials issued by the U.S. Government, including the PIV card and its predecessor, the CAC, as well as the PIV-I card issued by commercial contractors under a similar security standard.
 In our Credentials segment, we design and manufacture a broad range of NFC and RFID products, including inlays and inlay-based cards, labels, tags and stickers, as well as other RF and IC components, across HF and UHF technologies, and from basic transactional devices to high-end microprocessor-based devices.  We have expanded our solutions still further, incorporating advanced flexible, rechargeable battery technology to bring active-device capabilities to the Cold Chain market and opening the nearly-unlimited potential of active sensor-enabled applications. Our inlays and converted inlay products are used in a diverse range of applications, including electronic entertainment, loyalty schemes, mobile payment, transit and event ticketing, and others.
 We believe that the know-how across RFID, NFC as well as smart card technology positions us well to benefit from the increasing importance of contactless technologies in a range of applications. On the Identity side, it is our strategy to closely align with innovative OEM partners who are looking to include a subset of these capabilities into their products, for example for secure printing, gaming, or unattended vending applications. Similarly, we aim to be the go-to provider for complex RFID and transponder applications utilizing NFC, HF, or UHF technology, or a combination thereof. We believe the capabilities we are developing in our engineering and research center in Germany provides a differentiator for product owners with specific and unique requirements. Often  these relationships start with an agreement on shared non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) related costs.  Brand authenticity and consumer engagement applications especially demand compliance with a high level of technical requirements as well as specific expectations around the appearance of the product, user experience and reliability. We believe our ability to provide high-quality product pilots in small badges with rapid turnaround will provide us with a competitive advantage. 
 As across all our offerings, we are aiming to position ourselves as the preferred trusted advisor and development partner for our customers and partners.
 Positioned for Growth in Growing Markets
 Leveraging our expertise in RFID and NFC technology, and mobility, we are developing new solutions for a wide range of physical, connected items, or IoT.  Market analysts estimate that by 2020 the number of physical things connected to the Internet will grow into the tens of billions. These will include household appliances, vehicles, medicines, home security systems, books, luggage, jewelry, toys and a host of other objects. We believe the growth of the IoT creates significant opportunities to provide physical access and authentication into nearly every industry, worldwide.  We plan to leverage our physical access, video and analytics solutions as well as RFID-based physical device-management expertise to provide leading solutions as our customers, and our customers’ customers, embrace the IoT.
 Also underneath the umbrella of IoT, we are positioned in growing markets. Market analysts estimate the premises security market will to continue to grow, with services and video being among the faster growing market segments, as well as the RFID and transponder markets. In addition, we believe that our markets are generally fragmented. As such, we believe we are positioned to grow in our core markets, and do so organically and inorganically. A first execution step on our inorganic growth strategy is evidenced by our acquisition of 3VR in February of 2018.
 Customers 
 We sell to customers worldwide in a diverse range of markets, including government, enterprise, consumer, education, healthcare and transportation. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 33% of total net revenue in 2017 and 34% of total net revenue in 2016. A significant amount of revenue is sourced from sales of products and systems to our OEM partners and an indirect sales network who sell to various entities within the U.S. federal government sector. U.S. federal government sales are primarily delivered through our OEM partners and an indirect sales network or are priced using published General Service Administration schedules. 
 7

Sales and Marketing
 We primarily conduct our own sales and marketing activities in each of the markets in which we compete, utilizing our own sales and marketing organization to solicit prospective channel partners and customers, provide technical advice and support with respect to products, systems and services, and manage relationships with customers, distributors and/or OEMs. We sell our smart card readers and RFID/NFC products directly to end users and utilize indirect sales channels that may include OEMs, dealers, systems integrators, value added resellers, resellers or Internet sales. We sell our physical access control solutions and access card services primarily through systems integrators, dealers and value added partners, although we also sell directly to end users. In support of our sales efforts, we participate in trade shows and conduct sales training courses, targeted marketing programs, and ongoing customer, channel partner and third-party communications programs. 
Competition
 The market for security solutions is competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards in the industry as a whole and within specific markets. We believe that competition for security solutions is likely to intensify as a result of an ongoing increase in demand for our solutions that help converge physical and logical access control systems and RFID and NFC products to enable expansion of the connected world.  The increase in competition will come from two additional factors. First, the vast growth of data being generated by high bandwidth security devices, especially video, as well as the increasing number of electronic-access doors.  As data volumes become increasingly unmanageable with classic systems relying on monitoring by guards, real-time analytics and purpose built forensic platforms will deliver these critical security results.  Second, technically advanced hardware is moving into commercial markets, driven by volume cost curves as disruptive consumer and small and medium business focused startups launch commercial-scale capabilities into these high volume markets.
 As these longer-term competitive dynamics emerge, we currently face a range of competition for our products, systems and solutions. Competition for our smart card readers and related products primarily comes from several well-established companies, including Gemalto NV and OMNIKEY/HID Global (a division of ASSA ABLOY AB), as well as from a number of smaller suppliers in Asia. Competition for our RFID inlays and inlay-based products comes from a small number of organizations that understand the specialized processes and have the capital equipment required to serve the RFID/NFC technology market. Competitors in this market include SMARTRAC NV, as well as a number of inlay conversion companies in Asia. In the market for NFC tags, readers and other solutions, we face competition from traditional smart card reader and RFID technology providers, including Gemalto and ASSA ABLOY for NFC readers, and SMARTRAC and other inlay converters for NFC tags. 
 Enterprise-class physical access control solutions are available from multiple suppliers. In this market we primarily compete with Lenel Systems International (a division of United Technologies Corp.), Software House (a division of Tyco International Ltd.), Gallagher Group Ltd., Honeywell International Inc., and AMAG Technology (a division of G4S plc).  Competition for our video management and analytics solutions, which mainly consist of the solutions added through the acquisition of 3VR, is expected from several other companies either offering video management systems (“VMS”) or analytics solutions, including Exacq, Genetec, Inc., Milestone Systems, and RetailNext, Inc.
 We may in the future face competition from other parties that develop physical security and RFID solutions based upon approaches similar to or different from those employed by us. In addition, these markets for security solutions may ultimately be dominated by approaches other than the approach marketed by us. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products, systems and solutions include: 
  
• | technical features;
--+--------------------


• | the ability of channel partners to effectively integrate multiple products and systems in order to address customer requirements including full system capabilities, cost of ownership and ease of use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | quality and reliability;
--+-------------------------


• | the ability of suppliers to quickly develop new products and integrated solutions to satisfy new customer requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ease of use;
--+-------------


• | strength of sales and distribution channels; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | price and total cost of system ownership.
--+------------------------------------------

 While we believe that we compete favorably within our market environment, our ability to continue to successfully compete is subject to a variety of factors, as further discussed below in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 8

Seasonality and Other Factors
 In our business overall, we may experience significant variations in demand for our offerings from quarter to quarter, and typically experience a stronger demand cycle in the second half of our fiscal year. Sales of our premises solutions to U.S. Government agencies are subject to annual government budget cycles and generally are highest in the third quarter of each year. However, the usual seasonal trend can be negatively impacted by actions such as government shutdowns and the passing of continuing resolutions which can act to delay the completion of certain projects. Sales of our identity reader chips, many of which are sold to government agencies worldwide, are impacted by testing and compliance schedules of government bodies as well as roll-out schedules for application deployments, both of which contribute to variability in demand from quarter to quarter. Further, this business is typically subject to seasonality based on differing commercial and global government budget cycles.  Lower sales are expected in the U.S. in the first half, and in particular the first quarter of the year, with higher sales typically in the second half of each year. In Asia and Australia, with fiscal year-ends in March and June, order demand can be high in the first half as customers attempt to complete projects before the end of the fiscal year. Accordingly, our net revenue levels in the first quarter and first half each year often depends on the relative strength of project completions and sales mix between our U.S. customer base and our International customer base. 
 In addition to the general seasonality of demand, overall U.S. Government expenditure patterns have a significant impact on demand for our products due to the significant portion of revenues that are typically sourced from U.S. Government agencies. Therefore, any significant reduction in U.S. Government spending could adversely impact our financial results and could cause our operating results to fall below any guidance we provide to the market or below the expectations of investors or security analysts.
 Backlog 
 We typically do not maintain a significant level of backlog and revenue in any quarter significantly depends on contracts entered into or orders received and shipped in that quarter. The majority of our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. While our customer contracts generally do not require fixed long-term purchase commitments, from time to time we do enter into customer contracts where delivery of products, systems or services is ongoing or is scheduled over multiple quarters or years. In view of our order and shipment patterns, and because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders, we do not believe that the ongoing arrangements we enter into provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period.
Research and Development
 We have made and continue to make significant investments in research and the development of solutions for customers in the government, enterprise, consumer and commercial markets. We focus the bulk of our research and development activities on the development of products and solutions for new and emerging market opportunities. In addition to developing core technology that can be leveraged across a number of products, our engineering team works with product managers, applications engineers, distribution partners, third party consultants and customers to develop new products, product enhancements, software and systems to meet customer and market requirements. We also strive to develop and maintain close relationships with key suppliers of components and technologies in order to be able to quickly introduce new offerings that incorporate the latest technological advances. New offerings introduced across our businesses resulting in new inventions provide opportunities for new patent applications.
 Our recent research and development activities have included enhancements for our physical access controller platforms, which address new market trends such as secure mobile access and extends our available customer base to include smaller enterprises. On an ongoing basis, we invest in the development of new contactless readers, tokens and modules, new physical access readers to enable converged physical and logical access, and in the extension of our contactless platforms. In addition, we continue to enhance and broaden our RFID and NFC inlay designs and technologies in the areas of security, enablement for NFC applications, card manufacturing and other applications. 
 We attempt to balance our investment in new technologies, products and services with careful management of our development resources so that our increased development activities do not result in unexpected or significant changes in our overall spending on research and development. Research and development expenses were $6.1 million in 2017 and $6.5 million in 2016. We capitalized payroll related expenses related to development of our card issuance services of $0.2 million and $0.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, we capitalized $0.4 million of software development costs in 2017 for costs incurred subsequent to a product achieving technological feasibility and prior to the product’s general release to customers. No software development costs were capitalized in 2016. 
 We conduct our research and development activities from several locations around the world. Development of our smart card reader products and technologies primarily takes places in India. Development of our physical access control solutions primarily takes place in California. Development of our RFID and NFC products and technology primarily takes place in Singapore.

Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends partly upon our proprietary technology. We currently rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which afford only limited protection. Although we often seek to protect our proprietary technology through patents, it is possible that no new patents will be issued, that our proprietary products or technologies are not patentable, and that any issued patent will fail to provide us with any competitive advantages. The core of our proprietary technology advantage is the combination of our advanced technical expertise combined with our intimate customer knowledge, enabling us to develop and bring to market products uniquely positioned to deliver benefits to customers.  This is an intellectual property advantage more characterized by trade secrets and unique relationships than formal patents.
 There has been a great deal of litigation in the technology industry regarding intellectual property rights and from time to time we may be required to use litigation to protect our proprietary technology. This may result in our incurring substantial costs and there is no assurance that we would be successful in any such litigation. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to use our proprietary information and software without authorization. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws in the U.S. Because many of our products are sold and a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S., our exposure to intellectual property risks may be higher. Our means of protecting our proprietary and intellectual property rights may not be adequate. There is a risk that our competitors will independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or design around our patents or other intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property or our products or technologies are duplicated by others, our business could be harmed. 
 In addition, we have from time to time received claims that we are infringing upon third parties’ intellectual property rights. Future disputes with third parties may arise and these disputes may not be resolved on terms acceptable to us. As the number of products and competitors in our target markets grow, the likelihood of infringement claims also increases. Any claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, cause product shipment delays, or require us to redesign our products, accept product returns or to write-off inventory. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. 
 We have a portfolio of approximately 30 patent families (designs, patents, utility models, patents pending and exclusive licenses) in individual or regional filings, covering products, electrical and mechanical designs, software systems and methods and manufacturing process ideas for our various businesses. We also submitted and have pending U.S. and foreign patent filings in RFID tags, converged access readers and systems, smart card manufacturing methods, authentication and NFC offerings. Additionally, we leverage our own ASIC designs for smart card interface in some of our reader devices. However, none of our patents are currently material to our business.
 Manufacturing and Sources of Supply
 We utilize a combination of our own manufacturing facilities and the services of contract manufacturers in various countries around the world to manufacture our products and components. Our physical access keypads, controllers and software are manufactured primarily in California, using locally sourced components. The majority of our smart card reader products and components are manufactured in Singapore and China. Our RFID and NFC inlays and inlay-based products such as labels and tags are manufactured and assembled by our own internal manufacturing teams in Singapore primarily using locally sourced components and are certified to the ISO 9001:2000 quality manufacturing standard.
 We have implemented formal quality control programs to satisfy customer requirements for high quality and reliable products. To ensure that products manufactured by third parties are consistent with internal standards, our quality control programs include management of all key aspects of the production process, including establishing product specifications, selecting the components to be used to produce products, selecting the suppliers of these components and negotiating the prices for certain of these components. In addition, we may work with suppliers to improve process control and product design.

 We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to provide quality products and services while ensuring the highest level of security for our products during the manufacturing process. In the event any of our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture our products, we may have to rely on other current manufacturing sources or identify and qualify new contract manufacturers. Any significant delay in our ability to obtain adequate supplies of our products from current or alternative sources would harm our business and operating results.
 For the majority of our product manufacturing, we utilize a global sourcing strategy that serves all business solution areas within the company, which allows us to achieve economies of scale and uniform quality standards for our products and support higher gross margins.

On an ongoing basis, we analyze the need to add alternative sources for both our products and components. For example, we currently utilize the foundry services of external suppliers to produce our ASICs for smart cards readers and inlays, and we use chips and antenna components from third-party suppliers in our RFID and NFC inlays and contactless smart card readers. Wherever possible, we have qualified additional sources of supply for components. However, a risk remains that we may be adversely impacted by an inadequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries or poor component quality. In addition, some of the basic components used in our reader products, such as semiconductors, may at any time be in great demand. This could result in components not being available to us in a timely manner or at all, particularly if larger companies have ordered significant volumes of these components, or higher prices being charged for components we require.

Legal Proceedings 
 On December 16, 2015, we and certain of our present and former officers and directors were named as defendants in a putative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled Rok v. Identiv, Inc., et al., Case No. 15-cv-05775, alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934. On May 3, 2016, the court-appointed lead plaintiff Thomas Cunningham in the Rok lawsuit filed an amended complaint and a notice of dismissal without prejudice of all current or former officers and directors other than Jason Hart and Brian Nelson. On June 6, 2016, each of us, Jason Hart, and Brian Nelson filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted in the Rok lawsuit; on August 5, 2016, the court granted those motions with leave for the lead plaintiff to file a second amended complaint. On September 12, 2016, the lead plaintiff in the Rok lawsuit filed a second amended complaint. On October 10, 2016, each of us, Jason Hart, and Brian Nelson filed a motion to dismiss that second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted in the Rok lawsuit; on January 4, 2017, the court granted those motions with prejudice and entered judgment for us and the other defendants and against the lead plaintiff.  On February 6, 2017, the lead plaintiff initiated an appeal of the court’s decision in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Following the lead plaintiff’s routine request to extend filing deadlines, which the Court of Appeals approved, the lead plaintiff’s opening appellate brief was filed on June 14, 2017. Following Jason Hart’s routine request to extend filing deadlines, which the Court of Appeals approved, the answering briefs of the Company and the other defendants were filed on August 14, 2017.  Following the lead plaintiff’s routine request to extend filing deadlines, which the Court of Appeals approved, the lead plaintiff’s optional reply brief was filed on October 5, 2017.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held oral argument on March 13, 2018.  On March 23, 2018, the Ninth Circuit issued an order affirming the dismissal with prejudice.  In the interim, on January 3, 2018, lead plaintiffs filed a motion under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b) in the trial court to vacate the January 4, 2017 judgment of dismissal.  On February 9, 2018, following additional briefing, the trial court denied the motion.
 In addition, three shareholder derivative actions were filed between January and February 2016.  On January 1, 2016, certain of our present and former officers and directors were named as defendants, and we were named as nominal defendant, in a shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled Oswald v. Humphreys, et al., Case No. 16-cv-00241-CRB, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and waste claims.  On January 25, 2016, certain of our present and former officers and directors were named as defendants, and we were named as nominal defendant, in a shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda, entitled Chopra v. Hart, et al., Case No. RG16801379, alleging breach of fiduciary duty claims.  On February 9, 2016, certain of our present and former officers and directors were named as defendants, and we were named as nominal defendant, in a shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda, entitled Wollnik v. Wenzel, et al., Case No. HG16803342, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, gross mismanagement, and unjust enrichment claims.  These lawsuits generally allege that we made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information in certain public filings and disclosures between 2013 and 2015.  Each of the lawsuits seeks one or more of the following remedies: unspecified compensatory damages, unspecified exemplary or punitive damages, restitution, declaratory relief, equitable and injunctive relief, and reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.  On May 2, 2016, the court in the Chopra lawsuit entered an order staying proceedings in the Chopra lawsuit in favor of the Oswald lawsuit, based on a stipulation to

that effect filed by the parties in the Chopra lawsuit on April 28, 2016.  Similarly, on June 28, 2016, the court in the Wollnik lawsuit entered a stipulated order staying proceedings in the Wollnik lawsuit in favor of the Oswald lawsuit.  On June 17, 2016, the plaintiff in the Oswald lawsuit filed an amended complaint.  On August 1, 2016, we filed a motion to dismiss for failure by plaintiff to make a pre-lawsuit demand on our board of directors, which motion was heard on October 14, 2016. The judge in the Oswald lawsuit issued an order on November 7, 2016 granting our motion to dismiss, without prejudice.  In addition, the court stayed the case so that plaintiff could exercise whatever rights he had under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.  On or around November 30, 2016, the plaintiff purported to serve a books and records demand under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.  We have responded to that demand. On March 21, 2017, we and the plaintiff in the Oswald lawsuit filed a stipulation and proposed order lifting the stay of the case, granting the plaintiff leave to amend, and setting a briefing schedule.  That stipulation proposed that the judge’s stay of the case entered November 7, 2016 be lifted, that a stay of proceedings as to the individual defendants that the judge previously entered remain in place, that the plaintiff may file a second amended complaint on or before April 10, 2017, that we may file a motion to dismiss that second amended complaint on or before May 12, 2017, that the plaintiff’s opposition to such a motion to dismiss shall be filed on or before June 12, 2017, that our reply in support of such a motion shall be filed on or before June 30, 2017, and that the hearing on such a motion to dismiss shall be held on August 11, 2017 or such other date as the court may order.  On March 22, 2017, the court entered an order approving that stipulation.  The plaintiff in the Oswald lawsuit filed his second amended complaint on April 10, 2017. We then filed a motion to dismiss that second amended complaint on May 12, 2017, the plaintiff filed an opposition to that motion to dismiss on June 12, 2017, and we filed a reply in support of the motion on June 30, 2017. The hearing on that motion to dismiss was rescheduled by stipulation of the parties to September 22, 2017 and then further rescheduled by the court to October 6, 2017. The hearing on that motion to dismiss was held on October 6, 2017, and that day the court entered a minute entry indicating the motion would be denied.  On October 22, 2017, the court issued its written order denying the motion to dismiss on the basis of demand futility.  On December 15, 2017, the court held a status conference.  On January 3, 2018, the court entered a stipulated order setting a response and briefing schedule for defendants to the second amended complaint.  Pursuant to the schedule, defendants filed motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) on January 16, 2018.  Plaintiff filed his opposition brief on February 14, 2018.  Defendants’ reply briefs are due on March 2, 2018.  The court heard argument on the motions to dismiss on March 23, 2018 and took the matters under submission.  On October 18, 2017, the court in the Wollnik lawsuit conducted a case management conference, at the conclusion of which the court scheduled a complex determination hearing for November 28, 2017. We filed a notice of non-opposition to complex case designation and request for coordination with the Chopra lawsuit on October 24, 2017. The plaintiff in the Wollnik lawsuit filed a statement of non-opposition to complex case designation on or about November 27, 2017. The court continued the complex determination hearing to April 3, 2018. We intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits.  We cannot currently predict the impact or resolution of each of these lawsuits or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any, which could be material, and the resolution of these lawsuits may harm our business and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.
 From time to time, we could become subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business or could be named a defendant in additional lawsuits. The outcome of such claims or other proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and may have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
