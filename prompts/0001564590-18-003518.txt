ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
General 
 We were incorporated in Delaware on November 27, 2001. We are a medical technology company that primarily develops, manufactures and markets innovative portable oxygen concentrators used to deliver supplemental long-term oxygen therapy to patients suffering from chronic respiratory conditions. Traditionally, these patients have relied on stationary oxygen concentrator systems for use in the home and oxygen tanks or cylinders for mobile use, which we call the delivery model. The tanks and cylinders must be delivered regularly and have a finite amount of oxygen, which requires patients to plan activities outside of their homes around delivery schedules and a finite oxygen supply. Additionally, patients must attach long, cumbersome tubing to their stationary concentrators simply to enable mobility within their homes. Our proprietary Inogen One® systems concentrate the air around the patient to offer a single source of supplemental oxygen anytime, anywhere with a portable device weighing approximately 2.8, 4.8 or 7.0 pounds with a single battery. Our Inogen One G4®, Inogen One G3® and Inogen One G2® have up to 2.6, 4.7 and 5.0 hours of battery life, respectively, with a single battery and can be plugged into an outlet when at home, in a car, or in a public place with outlets available. Our Inogen One systems reduce the patient’s reliance on stationary concentrators and scheduled deliveries of tanks with a finite supply of oxygen, thereby improving patient quality of life and fostering mobility.
 Portable oxygen concentrators represented the fastest-growing segment of the Medicare oxygen therapy market between 2012 and 2016. We estimate based on 2016 Medicare data that the total number of patients using portable oxygen concentrators represents approximately 9.1% of the total addressable oxygen market in the United States, although the Medicare data does not account for private insurance and cash-pay patients in the market. Based on 2016 industry data, we believe we were the leading worldwide manufacturer of portable oxygen concentrators. We believe we are the only manufacturer of portable oxygen concentrators that employs a direct-to-consumer strategy in the United States, meaning we market our products to patients, process their physician paperwork, provide clinical support as needed and bill Medicare or insurance on their behalf. To pursue a direct-to-consumer strategy, our manufacturing competitors would need to meet national accreditation and state-by-state licensing requirements and secure Medicare billing privileges, including Medicare competitive bidding contracts, as well as compete with the home medical equipment providers who many of our manufacturing competitors sell to across their entire homecare businesses.

Since adopting our direct-to-consumer strategy in 2009 following our acquisition of Comfort Life Medical Supply, LLC, which had an active Medicare billing number but few other assets and limited business activities, we have directly sold or rented more than 362,000 of our Inogen oxygen concentrators as of December 31, 2017.
 We incorporated Inogen Europe Holding B.V., a Dutch limited liability company, on April 13, 2017.  We own all outstanding stock of Inogen Europe Holding B.V., which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Inogen, Inc.
 Our market 
 We believe the current total addressable oxygen therapy market in the United States is approximately $3 billion to $4 billion, based on 2016 Medicare data and our estimate of the ratio of the Medicare market to the total market. As of 2016, we estimate that there are 4.5 million patients worldwide who use oxygen therapy, including 2.5 to 3 million patients in the United States, and more than 60% of oxygen therapy patients in the United States are covered by Medicare. The number of oxygen therapy patients in the United States is projected to grow by approximately 7% to 10% per year between 2017 and 2021, which we believe is the result of earlier diagnosis of chronic respiratory conditions, demographic trends and longer durations of long-term oxygen therapy. 
 Long-term oxygen therapy has been shown to be a cost-efficient and clinically effective means to treat hypoxemia, a condition in which patients have insufficient oxygen in the blood. Hypoxemic patients are unable to convert oxygen found in the air into the bloodstream in an efficient manner, causing organ damage and poor health. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a leading cause of hypoxemia. Approximately 70% of our patient population has been diagnosed with COPD, which we believe is reflective of the long-term oxygen therapy market in general. Industry sources estimate that 24 million people in the United States suffer from COPD, of which one-half are undiagnosed. 
 According to our analysis of 2016 Medicare data, approximately 70% of U.S. oxygen users require ambulatory oxygen and the remaining 30% are considered stationary, and either require oxygen twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, or 24/7, but are not ambulatory, or do not require oxygen 24/7 and only need nocturnal oxygen. Clinical data has shown that ambulatory patients that use oxygen 24/7 regardless of whether such patients rely on portable oxygen concentrators or the delivery model, have approximately two times the survival rate and spend at least 60% fewer days annually in the hospital than non-ambulatory 24/7 patients. The cost of one year of oxygen therapy is less than the cost of one day in the hospital. Of the ambulatory patients, we estimate based on 2016 Medicare data that greater than 85% rely upon the delivery model, which has the following disadvantages:
 
 
• | limited flexibility outside the home, dictated by the finite oxygen supply provided by tanks and cylinders and dependence on delivery schedules;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restricted mobility and inconvenience within the home, as patients must attach long, cumbersome tubing to a noisy stationary concentrator to move within their homes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | products are not cleared for use on commercial aircraft and cannot plug into a vehicle outlet for extended use; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | high costs driven by the infrastructure necessary to establish a geographically diverse distribution network to serve patients locally, as well as personnel, fuel and other costs, which have limited economies of scale and generally increase over time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Portable oxygen concentrators were developed in response to many of the limitations associated with traditional oxygen therapy. Portable oxygen concentrators are designed to offer a self-replenishing, unlimited supply of oxygen that is concentrated from the surrounding air and to operate without the need for oxygen tanks or regular oxygen deliveries, enhancing patient freedom and independence. Additionally, because portable oxygen concentrators do not require the physical infrastructure and service intensity of the delivery model, we believe portable oxygen concentrators can provide long-term oxygen therapy with a lower cost structure. Despite the ability of portable oxygen concentrators to address many of the shortcomings of traditional oxygen therapy, we estimate based on 2016 Medicare data that the total number of patients on portable oxygen concentrators represents approximately 9.1% of the total addressable oxygen market in the United States, although the Medicare data does not account for private insurance and cash-pay patients in the market. We believe the following have hindered the market acceptance of portable oxygen concentrators: 
 
 
• | to obtain portable oxygen concentrators, patients are dependent on home medical equipment providers, which have made significant investments in the physical distribution infrastructure to support the delivery model and which we believe are therefore disincentivized to encourage adoption of portable oxygen concentrators;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | lack of patient and physician awareness of the existence and benefits of portable oxygen concentrators as an oxygen solution instead of the traditional delivery model;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
3


 
• | constrained manufacturing costs of conventional portable oxygen concentrators, driven by home medical equipment provider preference for products that have lower upfront equipment cost; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limitations of conventional portable oxygen concentrators, including bulkiness, poor reliability and lack of suitability beyond intermittent or travel use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our solution 
 Our Inogen One systems provide patients who require long-term oxygen therapy with a reliable, lightweight single solution product that we believe improves quality-of-life, fosters mobility and eliminates dependence on both oxygen tanks and cylinders as well as stationary concentrators. We believe our direct-to-consumer strategy increases our ability to effectively develop, design and market our Inogen One solutions, as it allows us to: 
  
• | drive patient awareness of our portable oxygen concentrators through direct marketing, thereby fueling our direct-to-consumer sales channel and creating pull through for our business-to-business channel. Other manufacturers solely rely upon selling to homecare businesses, many of whom are incentivized to continue to service oxygen patients through the delivery model;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | capture the manufacturer and home medical equipment provider margins on a portion of our revenue, allowing us to focus on the total cost of the solution and to invest in the development of product features instead of being constrained by the price required to attract representation from a distribution channel. For example, we have invested in features that improve patient satisfaction, product durability, reliability and longevity, which increase the cost of our hardware, but reduce the total cost of our solution by reducing our maintenance and repair cost; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | access and utilize direct patient feedback in our research and development efforts, allowing us to innovate based on this feedback and stay at the forefront of patient preference. For example, certain of the specifications of the Inogen One G4 and its accessories were created based on direct patient feedback.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the combination of our direct-to-consumer strategy with our singular focus on designing and developing oxygen concentrator technology has created the best-in-class portfolio of portable oxygen concentrators. Our three current portable product offerings, the Inogen One G4, Inogen One G3 and Inogen One G2, at approximately 2.8, 4.8 and 7.0 pounds with a single battery, respectively, are among the lightest portable oxygen concentrators on the market and offer among the highest oxygen flow capacity per pound. We believe our Inogen One solutions offer the following benefits: 
  
• | Single solution for home, ambulatory, travel (including on commercial aircraft) and nocturnal treatment. We believe our Inogen One solutions are the only portable oxygen concentrators marketed as a single solution, by which we mean a patient can use our Inogen One systems as their only supplemental oxygen source with no need to also use a stationary concentrator regularly. Our compressors are specifically designed to enable our patients to run our portable oxygen concentrators 24/7, whether powered by battery or plugged into an outlet at home or in a car while the battery is recharging.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reliability. We have prioritized product performance and reliability in each of our design projects and continuous improvement efforts. For example, beginning with the Inogen One G2, we have designed and manufactured our own compressors to ensure long life and high reliability. We have also continually improved compressor component designs and manufacturing processes throughout the product life cycle to capitalize on our integrated design and manufacturing team approach. Reliability is not only critical to patient satisfaction, but also to our cost management initiative, as our minimal physical infrastructure makes product exchanges more costly to us than providers with greater local physical infrastructure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective for nocturnal use. Our Intelligent Delivery Technology enables our portable oxygen concentrators to provide consistent levels of oxygen during sleep despite decreased respiratory rates. As a result, patients can rely on our Inogen One portable oxygen concentrators overnight while sleeping.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unparalleled flow capacity. Our 2.8 pound Inogen One G4 has higher flow capacity than other sub-3 pound portable oxygen concentrators, our Inogen One G3 has higher flow capacity than other sub-5 pound portable oxygen concentrators, and our 7.0 pound Inogen One G2 has higher flow capacity than other sub-10 pound portable oxygen concentrators.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | User friendly features. Our systems are designed with multiple user-friendly features, including long battery life and low noise levels in their respective weight categories.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home system 
 We market our current portable product offerings, the Inogen One G4, the Inogen One G3 and the Inogen One G2, as single solutions for oxygen therapy. This means our solutions can operate on a 24/7 basis for at least 60 months without a stationary concentrator. We believe the technology in our Inogen One systems is effective for nocturnal use. Our Inogen One G4, Inogen One G3 and Inogen One G2 are sub-3, sub-5 and sub-10 pound portable oxygen concentrators, respectively, that can operate reliably and cost-effectively over the long period of time needed to service oxygen therapy patients without supplemental use of a stationary concentrator or a replacement portable oxygen concentrator. The following table summarizes our key product features: 

 | Key Product Specifications

 We have focused our research and development efforts on creating solutions that we believe have overcome the reputation of portable oxygen concentrators as being limited in durability and reliability as well as unsuitable for nighttime or 24/7 use. We specifically designed our compressors for 24/7 use. 
 All of our Inogen One systems are equipped with Intelligent Delivery Technology, a form of pulse-dose technology from which the patient receives a bolus of oxygen upon inhalation. Pulse-dose technology was developed to extend the number of hours an oxygen tank would last and is generally used on all ambulatory oxygen therapy devices. Our proprietary conserver technology utilizes differentiated triggering sensitivity to quickly detect a breath and ensure oxygen delivery within the first 400 milliseconds of inspiration, the interval when oxygen has the most effect on lung gas exchange. During periods of sleep, respiratory rates typically decrease. Our Inogen One systems actively respond to this changing physiology through the use of proprietary technology that increases bolus size. Our Intelligent Delivery Technology is designed to provide effective levels of blood oxygen saturation during sleep and all other periods of rest and activity that are substantially equivalent to continuous flow systems. 
 The Inogen One G4, our latest portable oxygen concentrator released to market in May 2016, is among the lightest products on the market and has higher oxygen production capabilities than the other sub-3 pound portable oxygen concentrators on the market. We believe the performance parameters around the Inogen One G4, Inogen One G3 and Inogen One G2 allow us to serve approximately 95% of the ambulatory oxygen patients and enable us to address a patient’s particular clinical needs, as well as lifestyle and performance preferences. 
 The Inogen At Home stationary oxygen concentrator allows us to access the non-ambulatory oxygen patient market and serves as a backup to our Inogen One system for ambulatory patients on our rental service. At approximately 18 pounds, we believe the Inogen At Home concentrator is the lightest five liter per minute continuous flow oxygen concentrator on the market today. Additionally, the Inogen At Home product has low power consumption with worldwide electrical compatibility, which should reduce the cost of electricity for oxygen therapy patients, as well as reduce manufacturing and distribution complexities. While the Inogen One product line is clinically validated for 24/7 use, the Inogen At Home represents a compelling solution for stationary oxygen therapy patients that do not require a portable solution, which are estimated to represent approximately 30% of total oxygen patients in the United States.
 Our direct-to-consumer business model has enabled us to receive direct patient feedback, and we have used this feedback to create portable oxygen concentrators that address the full suite of features and benefits critical to patient preference and retention. Our products prevent patients from having to choose between lightweight size, suitability for 24/7 use, reliability, and key features such as battery life, flow and reduced noise levels. 
 Domestic sales and marketing 
 In the United States, we market and distribute our products directly to consumers, through a wide variety of direct-to-consumer sales and marketing strategies including consumer advertising, an inside-sales staff, and a physician referral model. Of the $193.9 million of our 2017 revenue derived from the United States, approximately 44.7% represented cash-pay sales to consumers, 43.0%

represented sales to traditional home medical equipment providers, distributors (including our private label partner) and resellers, and 12.3% represented direct-to-consumer rentals. 
 Our direct-to-consumer sales and marketing efforts are focused on generating awareness and demand for our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems among patients, physicians and other clinicians, and third-party payors. As of December 31, 2017, we employed a marketing team of 8 people, an in-house sales team of 283 people (including 263 inside sales representatives), and a field-based sales team of 19 people (including 17 physician sales representatives). 
 Patients who choose to use their Medicare or private insurance benefits typically rent our systems. Those who purchase our product outright are typically patients who are not eligible to use their insurance benefits due to their capped rental status, prefer to own the equipment, or have an immediate need for our product that cannot be processed in time by their primary insurance carrier (e.g., an upcoming trip). Our ability to rent to Medicare patients directly, bill Medicare and other third-party payors on their behalf, and service patients in their homes requires that we hold a valid Medicare supplier number, are accredited by an independent agency approved by Medicare, and comply with the differing licensure and process requirements in the 49 states in which we serve patients. 
 We use a variety of direct-to-consumer marketing strategies to generate interest in our solutions among current oxygen therapy patients. After a patient contacts us, we guide them through product selection and insurance eligibility, and, if they choose to move forward, process the necessary reimbursement and physician paperwork on their behalf, as well as coordinate the shipping, instruction, and clinical setup process. In accordance with Medicare regulations, we do not initially contact patients directly and contact them only upon an inbound inquiry or upon receipt of a physician’s order. The chart below describes our United States direct-to-consumer sales and rental process. 

We engage in a number of other initiatives to increase awareness, demand, and orders for Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems. These include attendance at oxygen therapy support groups, guest speaking arrangements at trade shows, and product demonstrations, as requested. Additionally, we are targeting private payors to become an in-network provider of oxygen therapy solutions, which we expect will reduce patient co-insurance amounts associated with using our solution. We believe this will result in both increased conversion of our initial leads, as well as direct referrals from insurance companies in some cases. 
 To supplement the direct-to-consumer marketing model, we are also utilizing a physician referral model as a complementary sales method. Under this model, our field sales representatives work with physicians in the representative’s territory to help physicians understand our products and the value these products provide for patients. We believe that by educating physicians on our products, we can cost-effectively supplement our direct-to-consumer sales and rentals and capture a greater number of patients earlier in the course of their oxygen therapy.

Our direct-to-consumer marketing strategies also create demand for our products among other homecare equipment providers and business partners.  In addition to generating consumer demand, we believe our products can create value for our business partners by either creating a retail sale opportunity for them or by reducing the need for costly home deliveries associated with oxygen tanks.  
 We sell to resellers and traditional homecare providers in the United States, Canada, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa that choose to deploy our products to oxygen therapy patients.  These customers market the benefits of our products to oxygen therapy patients through consumer advertising and/or retail locations or to physicians through field-based sales representatives.  We believe that in addition to the marketing efforts employed by our business customers, our own direct-to-consumer marketing efforts in the United States result in patient interest that our business customers field.  
 We also sell to traditional homecare providers that offer our products to patients through insurance worldwide.  Homecare providers that employ the standard delivery model with oxygen tanks need to replace the oxygen tanks on a regular basis by picking up the empty oxygen tanks and delivering full oxygen tanks for the patient. The delivery model has historically necessitated that a homecare provider have a facility near the oxygen patients that it serves and that the provider has invested in personnel, trucks, etc. to facilitate routine deliveries.  The cost to deliver the oxygen tanks to patients is significant for many providers in the standard delivery model.  Homecare providers that have adopted Inogen products have been able to reduce the costly deliveries associated with oxygen tanks since our products generate their own oxygen and don’t need to be refilled.  Our business-to-business sales and marketing strategy for these customers is to raise awareness of our solutions and educate homecare providers on how our products may be able to reduce their total cost of ownership of servicing oxygen patients.  As a homecare provider ourselves, we are able to help our business customers adopt a non-delivery oxygen therapy model utilizing patient preferred portable oxygen concentrators. We also private label our product with a business partner that sells to traditional homecare providers. Our private label partner employs field sales representatives that call on homecare providers to showcase the benefits of our products.  
 Concentration of Customers
 We primarily sell our products to traditional home medical equipment providers, distributors, and resellers in the United States and in foreign countries on a credit basis. We also sell our products direct to consumers on a primarily prepayment basis. One single customer, Applied Home Healthcare Equipment, our private label distribution partner, represented more than 10% of our total revenue for 2017 and 2016, and no single customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue for 2015. Two customers with accounts receivable balances of $10.4 million and $6.5 million, respectively, each represented more than 10% of our net accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2017, and one single customer with an accounts receivable balance of $9.8 million, represented more than 10% of our net accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2016. 
 We also rent products directly to consumers for insurance reimbursement, which resulted in a customer concentration relating to Medicare’s service reimbursement programs. Medicare’s service reimbursement programs accounted for 73.0%, 72.6% and 73.7% of rental revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and based on total revenue was 7.0%, 12.4% and 21.0% for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net accounts receivable balances relating to Medicare’s service reimbursement programs (including held and unbilled receivables, net of allowances) amounted to $1.5 million or 4.8% of total net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017 and $7.2 million or 23.4% of total net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016.
 International 
 Approximately 22.3% of our total revenue was from outside the United States in 2017. We sell through distributors, resellers, and home medical equipment providers in certain markets within Canada, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. We sell our products in 45 countries outside the United States through distributors or directly to large “house” accounts, which include gas companies and home oxygen providers. In this case, we sell to and bill the distributor or house accounts directly, leaving the patient billing, support, and clinical setup to the local provider. As of December 31, 2017, we had 13 people located in the United States who focused on selling our products and providing service and support to distributors and house accounts worldwide and 11 employees located in Europe who provided sales, customer service, and repair services to a portion of our international customers. No single international customer and no single foreign country represented more than 10% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 or 2015. 
 International sales revenue grew to $55.5 million in 2017 from $50.1 million in 2016. We estimate there are approximately more than 2 million long-term oxygen therapy patients outside of the United States. We believe that the international market is attractive for the following reasons: 
  
• | more favorable reimbursement in certain countries, including France and the United Kingdom, where portable oxygen concentrators receive more favorable reimbursement than in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7


 
• | less developed oxygen delivery infrastructure in some countries. We believe that some countries outside the United States have less developed oxygen delivery infrastructure than in the United States. As a result, portable oxygen concentrators enable providers to reach and service patients they cannot economically reach with the delivery model.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an absence of reimbursement for any ambulatory oxygen therapy modalities in some countries, resulting in patients bearing all of the cost of ambulatory oxygen therapy and therefore becoming more involved in the selection of the modality. In Australia, for example, patients shoulder the burden of all costs associated with ambulatory oxygen therapy. In these cases, they tend to choose products like portable oxygen concentrators that provide a higher level of personal freedom.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will continue to focus on building out our international sales efforts. In 2017, we added a European customer support site in the Netherlands after acquiring a previous distributor, MedSupport, now operating under Inogen Europe B.V. The new site offers multi-lingual customer service, repair services, and basic distribution, to improve our European customer support at lower cost. Also in support of our European operations, we began production of our Inogen One G3 concentrator in the fourth quarter of 2017 using a contract manufacturer, Foxconn, located in the Czech Republic to improve our ability to service our European customers.
 Customer support and order fulfillment 
 Our procedures enable us to package and ship a system directly to the patient in the patient’s preferred configuration the same day the order is received in most cases. This enables us to minimize the amount of finished goods inventory we keep on hand. Our primary logistics partner is United Parcel Service, or UPS. UPS supports our domestic shipments and provides additional services that support our direct-to-consumer oxygen therapy program. The UPS pick up service is used to retrieve products requiring repair and systems that are no longer needed by the patient. Additionally, UPS, when necessary and requested by us, will go into a patient’s home to remove a replacement product from the box, package the failed device and return it to us. In this manner, we are able to operate as a remote provider while maintaining the level of customer service of a local oxygen therapy provider. FedEx primarily supports our international shipments and limited domestic shipments. 
 We believe it is important to provide patients with quality customer support to achieve satisfaction with our products and optimal outcomes. As of December 31, 2017, we had a dedicated customer service team of 33 people who were trained on our products, a clinical support team of 25 people who were licensed nurses or respiratory therapists, and a dedicated billing services team of 78 people. We provide our patients with a dedicated 24/7 hotline. Via the hotline, patients have direct access to our customer service representatives, who can handle product-related questions. Additionally, clinical staff is on call 24/7 and available to patients whenever either the patient or the customer service representative deems appropriate. Our dedicated billing services team is available to answer patient questions regarding invoicing, reimbursement, and account status during normal business hours. We receive no additional reimbursement for patient support, but provide high-quality customer service to enhance patient comfort, satisfaction, compliance, and safety with our products. 
 Third-party reimbursement 
 Medicare and private insurance rentals represented approximately 9.6% of our total revenue in 2017, down significantly from 17.1% of our total revenue in 2016, primarily due to increased sales revenue with a continued focus on sales versus rentals and declines in reimbursement rates. In cases where we rent our oxygen therapy solutions directly to patients, we bill third-party payors, such as Medicare or private insurance, for monthly rentals on behalf of our patients. We process and coordinate all physician paperwork necessary for reimbursement of our solutions. A common medical criterion for oxygen therapy reimbursement is insufficient blood oxygen saturation level. Our team in sales and sales administration are trained on how to verify benefits, review medical records and process physician paperwork. Additionally, an independent internal review is performed and our products are not deployed until after physician paperwork is processed and reimbursement eligibility is verified and communicated to the patient. 
 We rely primarily on reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and secondarily, from private payors, Medicaid and patients for our rental revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 73.0% of our rental revenue was derived from Medicare’s service reimbursement programs. The U.S. list price for our stationary oxygen rentals (HCPCS E1390) is $260 per month and the U.S. list price for our oxygen generating portable equipment (OGPE) rentals (HCPCS E1392) is $70 per month.  Effective January 1, 2016, the current standard Medicare allowable varies by state instead of the one national standard allowable as in previous years. The national standard allowable in 2015 for stationary oxygen rentals (E1390) was $180.92 per month and for OGPE rentals (E1392) was $51.63 per month. Effective January 1, 2016, the Medicare allowable for stationary oxygen rentals (E1390) ranges from $135.14 to $145.61 per month and the OGPE rentals (E1392) ranges from $46.69 to $49.52 per month. Effective January 1, 2017, the Medicare allowable for stationary oxygen rentals (E1390) ranges from $66.53 to $77.16 per month and the OGPE rentals (E1392) ranges from $36.14 to $41.91 per month. These are the two primary codes that we bill to Medicare and other payors for our oxygen product rentals.

As of January 1, 2011, Medicare phased in the competitive bidding program. The competitive bidding program impacts the amount Medicare reimburses suppliers of durable medical equipment rentals, including portable oxygen concentrators. The program is defined geographically, with suppliers submitting bids to provide medical equipment for specific product categories within a specified geographic region called competitive bidding areas, or CBAs. Once bids have been placed, an individual company’s bids within a product category are aggregated and weighted by each product’s market share in the category. The weighted-average price is then indexed against all bidding suppliers. Medicare determines a “clearing price” out of these weighted-average prices, at which a sufficient number of suppliers have indicated they will support patients in the category. This threshold is typically designed to generate theoretical supply that is twice the expected demand. Bids for each modality among the suppliers that made the cut are then arrayed to determine what Medicare will reimburse for each product category and geographic area. The program has strict anti-collusion guidelines to ensure bidding is truly competitive. A competitive bidding contract lasts up to three years once implemented, after which the contract is subject to a new round of bidding. Discounts off the standard Medicare allowable occur in CBAs where contracts have been awarded as well as in cases where private payors pay less than this allowable. Competitive bidding rates are based on the zip code where the patient resides. Rental revenue includes payments for product, disposables, and customer service/support.
 In the CBAs covered under round two re-compete of the competitive bidding program, which began July 1, 2016, the Medicare allowable for stationary oxygen rentals (E1390) ranges from $70.00 to $89.86 per month (average of $76.84 per month) and the OGPE rentals (E1392) ranges from $33.97 to $42.00 per month (average of $37.90 per month). In the CBAs covered under round one 2017 of the competitive bidding program, which began January 1, 2017, the Medicare allowable for stationary oxygen rentals (E1390) ranges from $70.04 to $90.01 per month (average of $77.97 per month) and the OGPE rentals (E1392) ranges from $35.11 to $37.15 per month (average of $36.06 per month).
 As of January 1, 2016, all areas previously not subject to competitive bidding program (non-competitive bidding areas or “non-CBAs”) have experienced reductions in the Medicare fee schedule for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (DMEPOS). The fee schedules in the non-CBAs were adjusted based on regional averages of the single payment amounts that apply to the competitive bidding program (Adjusted Fee Schedule). The regional prices are limited by a national ceiling (110% of the average of the regional prices) and a national floor (90% of the average regional prices). From January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016, the reimbursement rates for these non-CBAs (with dates of service from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016) were 50% of the un-adjusted fee schedule amount plus 50% of the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount. As of July 1, 2016, Medicare reimbursed DMEPOS at 100% of the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount.  However, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”) was passed, which included a provision to roll-back the second cut to the non-CBA areas that was effective July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016.  Pricing in these areas was increased to the rates experienced in the period from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. This led to a benefit in rental revenue of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Effective January 1, 2017, rates are set at 100% of the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount, based on the regional competitive bidding rates. The Cures Act also calls for a study of the impact of the competitive bidding pricing on rural areas and accelerated the implementation of the Omnibus bill passed in December 2015 that will require state Medicaid agencies to match Medicare fee schedule reimbursement rates (including single payment amounts in applicable areas) to be effective beginning January 1, 2018, including for oxygen.
 The competitive bidding regions are defined as follows:

In addition to regional pricing, CMS imposed different pricing on “frontier states” and rural areas. CMS defines frontier states as states where more than 50% of the counties in the state have a population density of 6 people or less per square mile and rural states are defined as states where more than 50% of the population lives in rural areas per census data. Current frontier states include MT, ND, SD and WY; rural states include ME, MS, VT and WV; and non-contiguous United States areas include AK, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. For frontier and rural states, and frontier and rural zip codes in non-frontier/rural states, the single payment amount will be the national ceiling (110% of the average of the regional prices) to account for higher servicing costs in these areas. For non-contiguous United States areas, single payment amounts will be the higher of the national ceiling, or the average of competitive bidding pricing from these areas, if the areas had been bid through competitive bidding. We estimate that less than 10% of our patients would be eligible to receive the 110% of the regional prices for rural and frontier areas based on the geographic locations of our current patient population.
 CMS has also re-bid for competitive bidding round two re-compete, which is associated with approximately 50% of the Medicare market, with contracts which began on July 1, 2016 and will continue through December 31, 2018. CMS updated the product categories and the competitive bidding areas in the round two re-compete contracts. Respiratory equipment now includes oxygen, oxygen equipment, continuous positive airway pressure devices, respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories. Nebulizers are now their own separate product category instead of being included in the respiratory equipment category. Round two re-compete is in the same geographic areas that were included in the original round two. However, as a result of the Office of Management and Budget’s updates to the original 91 round two metropolitan statistical areas, there are now 90 metropolitan statistical areas for round two re-compete and 117 competitive bidding areas (CBAs). Any CBA that was previously located in multi-state metropolitan statistical areas was redefined so that no CBA is included in more than one state. The round two re-compete competitive bidding areas have nearly the same zip codes as the round two competitive bidding areas; the associated changes in the zip codes since competitive bidding was implemented are reflective in this round two re-compete. 
 CMS has also re-bid for the round one 2017 contracts effective January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018. In round one 2017, there are 9 metropolitan statistical areas and 13 CBAs to ensure there are no multi-state CBAs. We estimate approximately 9% of the Medicare market was impacted by the round one 2017 contracts. 
 The following table sets forth the current Medicare standard allowable reimbursement rates and the average of reimbursement rates applicable in Metropolitan Statistical Areas covered by rounds one and two of competitive bidding.
 
 
 | | | | Round one | | | Round two | | | Round one

In addition to reducing the Medicare reimbursement rates in the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), the competitive bidding program has effectively reduced the number of oxygen suppliers that can participate in the Medicare program. Based on industry data analyzing the number of unique supplier companies by state from July 2013 to April 2017, there has been a 41% decrease in the numbers of DMEPOS suppliers who have an active NPI number. We believe that approximately 59% of the Medicare market was covered by round one and round two of competitive bidding. 
 Cumulatively in round one, round two, round one re-compete, round two re-compete and round one 2017, we were offered contracts for a substantial majority of the CBAs and product categories for which we submitted bids. However, there is no guarantee that we will garner additional market share as a result of these contracts. The contracts include products that may require us to subcontract certain services or products to third parties, which must be approved by CMS. We currently operate in 49 of the 50 states in the U.S. We do not operate in Hawaii due to the licensure requirements. 
 Moreover, we cannot guarantee that we will be offered contracts in subsequent rounds of competitive bidding. In all five rounds of competitive bidding in which we have participated, we have gained access to certain CBAs and been excluded from other CBAs. 
 Following round one of competitive bidding, we were excluded from providing services to Medicare beneficiaries in the Kansas City-MO-KS, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach-FL, and Orlando-Kissimmee-FL CBAs. We had access to six CBAs of the nine regions subject to competitive bidding round one for the respiratory product category.

After round one re-compete of competitive bidding, we were excluded from providing services to Medicare beneficiaries in the following CBAs: Cleveland-Elyria-Mentor-OH, Cincinnati-Middleton-OH-KY-IN, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach-FL, Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford-FL, Pittsburg-PA, and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario-CA. We gained access to the Kansas City-MO -KS CBA. We had access to three CBAs of the nine regions subject to competitive bidding round one re-compete for the respiratory product category.
 After round one 2017 of competitive bidding, we have been excluded from the Chester-Lancaster and York Counties-SC CBA, which we previously won under round one re-compete. We also have been excluded from the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach-FL and Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford-FL CBAs. We have access to 10 of the 13 CBAs in which we bid for the respiratory product category: Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia-NC, Cincinnati-OH, Cleveland-Elyria-OH, Covington-Florence-Newport-KY, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington-TX, Dearborn-Franklin-Ohio, and Union Counties-IN, Kansas City-MO, Kansas City-Overland Park-Ottawa-KS, Pittsburgh-PA, and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario-CA. We have access to ten CBAs of the thirteen regions subject to competitive bidding round one 2017 for the respiratory product category.
 After round two of competitive bidding, we were excluded from 12 CBAs: Akron-OH, Cape Coral-Fort Myers-FL, Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach-FL, Honolulu-HI, Jacksonville-FL, Lakeland-Winter Haven-FL, Memphis-TN-MS-AR, North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota-FL, Ocala-FL, Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville-FL, Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater-FL, and Toledo-OH. We had access to 88 CBAs of the 100 regions subject to competitive bidding round two for the respiratory product category.

 After round two re-compete of competitive bidding, we were excluded from the following CBAs that we had previously won under round two: Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton-PA, Asheville-NC, Augusta-Richmond County-GA, Camden-NJ, Catoosa-Dade-Walker Counties-GA, Elizabeth-Lakewood-New Brunswick-NJ, Flint-MI, Greensboro-High Point-NC, Greenville-Anderson-Mauldin-SC, Jersey City-Newark-NJ, Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise-NV, Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway-AR, Louisville-Jefferson County-KY, Mercer County-PA, Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown-NY, Raleigh-NC, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre-Hazelton-PA, Stockton-Lodi-CA, Syracuse-NY, Wilmington-DE, and Youngstown-Warren-Boardman-OH. We were also excluded from the following CBAs in both round two and round two re-compete: Akron-OH and Toledo-OH. We gained access to certain Medicare markets in Cape-Coral-Fort Myers-FL, Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach-FL, Jacksonville-FL, Lakeland-Winter Haven-FL, North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton-FL, Ocala-FL, Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville-FL, and Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater-FL. We have access to 93 CBAs of the 117 regions subject to competitive bidding round two re-compete for the respiratory product category.
 Effective January 1, 2017, we believe we have access to over 85% of the Medicare oxygen therapy market based on our analysis of the 103 CBAs that we have won out of the 130 total CBAs. These 130 CBAs represent approximately 59% of the market with the remaining approximately 41% of the market not subject to competitive bidding. The loss of access to the CBAs where we were not awarded contracts is not expected to lead to a material adverse impact on our rental business. Medicare revenue, including patient co-insurance and deductible obligations, represented 7.0% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect the decline in total revenue resulting from the loss of competitive bidding contracts in the areas that we were excluded from to be partially offset by the “grandfathering” of existing Medicare patients (discussed below), rentals to patients with third-party insurance coverage, or Medicare patients paying out-of-pocket to purchase our products. Our revenue from Medicare in the 27 CBAs where we were not offered contracts as of January 1, 2017 was approximately $0.8 million and $1.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Under the competitive bidding program, DME suppliers that are not awarded a competitive bid contract in a CBA and product category which the DME supplier had previously been awarded a competitive bid contract may “grandfather” existing patients on service beginning on the effective date of the competitive bidding round. This means DME suppliers may retain all existing patients and continue to receive reimbursement for them, so long as the new reimbursement rate is accepted by the DME supplier and the beneficiary chooses to continue to receive equipment from the supplier. For example, a supplier that received a round two contract but not a round two re-compete contract may elect to “grandfather’ the patients that it serviced through the round two contract period. Suppliers must either keep or release all patients under this “grandfathering” arrangement in each CBA; a supplier may not select specific individuals to retain or release. Suppliers can continue to sell equipment in CBAs where they were not awarded contracts to patients paying out-of-pocket or with third-party insurance coverage. 
 We have elected to “grandfather” and retain all patients in CBAs in which we were not awarded contracts. In addition, we continue to accept patients in CBAs where we did not receive contracts through private insurance. We also pursue retail sales of our equipment to patients in those areas. 
 Medicare reimbursement for oxygen rental equipment is limited to a maximum of 36 months within a 60-month service period, and the equipment remains the property of the home oxygen supplier. The supplier that billed Medicare for the 36th month of service continues to be responsible for the patient’s oxygen therapy needs for months 37 through 60, and there is generally no additional reimbursement for oxygen generating portable equipment for these later months. CMS does not separately reimburse suppliers for 
 
11


oxygen tubing, cannulas and supplies that may be required for the patient. The supplier is required to keep the equipment provided in working order and in some cases, CMS will reimburse for repair costs. At the end of the five-year useful life of the equipment, the patient may request replacement equipment and, if he or she can be re-qualified for the Medicare benefit, a new maximum 36-month payment cycle out of the next 60 months of service would begin. The supplier may not arbitrarily issue new equipment. We have analyzed the potential impact to revenue associated with patients in the capped rental period and have deferred $0 associated with the capped rental period as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
 Our obligations to service Medicare patients over the contract rental period include supplying working equipment that meets each patient’s oxygen needs pursuant to his/her doctor’s prescription and certificate of medical necessity form and supplying all disposables required for the patient to operate the equipment, including cannulas, filters, replacement batteries, carts and carry bags, as needed. If the equipment malfunctions, we must repair or replace the equipment. We determine what equipment the patient receives, as long as that equipment meets the physician’s prescription, and we can deploy used assets in working order as long as the prescription requirements are met. We must also procure a recertification of the certificate of medical necessity from the patient’s doctor to confirm the patient’s need for oxygen therapy one year after the patient first receives oxygen therapy and one year after each new 36-month reimbursement period begins. The patient can choose to receive oxygen supplies and services from another supplier at any time, but the supplier may only transition the patient to another supplier in certain circumstances. 
 In addition to the adoption of the competitive bidding program, from 2010 through 2015, Medicare reimbursement rates for oxygen rental services in non-CBAs were eligible to receive mandatory annual updates based upon the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, or CPI-U. For 2014, the CPI-U was +1.8%, but the multi-factor productivity adjustment (Adjustment) was -0.8%, so the net result was a 1.0% increase in fee schedule payments in 2014 for items and services provided in areas not subject to competitive bidding. However, by law, the stationary oxygen equipment codes payment amounts must be adjusted on an annual basis, as necessary, to ensure budget neutrality of the new payment class for oxygen generating portable equipment (OGPE). Thus, the increase in allowable payment amounts for stationary oxygen equipment codes increased 0.5% from 2013 to 2014. For 2015, the CPI-U was +2.1%, but the Adjustment was -0.6%, so the net result was a 1.5% increase in fee schedule payments in 2015 for stationary oxygen equipment for items and services not included in an area subject to competitive bidding. Beginning in 2016, the standard allowable for all areas was set based on regional averages of the competitive bidding prices as described previously and no fees were based on non-competitive bidding. Accordingly, we do not anticipate future adjustments to the reimbursable fees based upon changes in CPI-U. However, as of January 1, 2017 and January 1, 2018 the Medicare reimbursement rates in the non-CBAs were adjusted to ensure budget neutrality based on the increased usage of the OGPE class that led to lower rates in these areas.  
 On November 4, 2016, CMS published a final rule in the Federal Register imposing additional regulations on the competitive bidding process. The final rule requires bidders choosing to participate in the competitive bidding program to obtain a $0.05 million surety bond for each CBA in which they bid. If a bidder does not accept a contract offer when its composite bid is at or below the median composite bid rate for suppliers used in the calculation of the single payment amount, the bid surety bond for the applicable CBA will be forfeited to CMS. In instances where the bidder does not meet the forfeiture conditions specified in the final rule, the bid surety bond liability will be returned to the bidder within 90 days of the public announcement of the contract suppliers for the CBA. Currently, there are 130 CBAs, which would mean a bidding supplier could incur a surety bond obligation with forfeiture conditions of up to $6.5 million. The final rule also changes the bid limits for individual items for future rounds of competitive bidding to reflect the 2015 unadjusted fee schedule to avoid a downward trend in bid pricing, to ensure the long-term viability of the competitive bidding program, and to allow suppliers to take into account both decreases and increases in costs in determining their bids. The rule also finalizes an appeals process for all breach of contract actions that CMS may take under the competitive bidding program. Lastly, the final rule sets forth a provision for lead item bidding for certain product categories in future bidding rounds to prevent the creation of price inversions, which occurred in round two of competitive bidding. Lead item bidding means that all HCPCS codes for similar items will be grouped together and priced relative to the bid for the “lead item,” as calculated by CMS.
 On November 2, 2017, a bi-partisan bill with 122 co-sponsors was introduced in the House of Representatives that would provide relief from competitive bidding in non-bid areas.  If passed, the bill would extend a retroactive delay of a second round of reimbursement cuts for Medicare beneficiaries from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2019 based on the reimbursement rates effective on January 1, 2016.  The legislation also proposes to remedy a double-dip cut to oxygen payments caused by the misapplication of a 2006 budget neutrality offset balancing increased utilization for oxygen generating portable equipment with lower reimbursement for stationary equipment.
 On February 12, 2018, the current presidential administration sent Congress a 2019 budget proposal that included language on competitive bidding. Specifically, the proposal eliminates the requirement under the competitive bidding program that CMS pay a single payment amount based on the median bid price, instead paying winning suppliers at their own bid amounts. Additionally, this proposal expands competitive bidding to all areas of the country, including rural areas, which will be based on competition in those areas rather than on competition in urban areas. This specific proposal is estimated to save the government $6.5 billion over 10 years.  In addition to changes to competitive bidding, the 2019 budget proposal would enable CMS not to impose the face-to-face 
 
12


requirement on all providers for durable medical equipment. Furthermore, the proposal seeks to address excessive billing of durable medical equipment that requires refills or serial claims. Specifically, Medicare would gain authority to test whether using a benefits manager for serial durable medical equipment claims result in lower improper payments and reductions in inappropriate utilization. The benefits manager would be responsible for ensuring beneficiaries were receiving the correct quantity of supplies or service for the appropriate time period. Lastly, the proposal would expand prior authorization to additional items and services that are both high-cost and at high-risk for improper payments.
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 93 contracts with Medicaid and private payors. These contracts qualify us as an in-network provider for these payors. As a result, patients can rent or purchase our systems at the same patient obligation as other in-network oxygen suppliers. Based on our patient population, we believe at least 30% of all oxygen therapy patients are covered by private payors. Private payors typically provide reimbursement at a rate between 60% and 100% of Medicare allowables for in-network plans, and although private payor plans can have 36-month capped rental periods similar to Medicare, they typically do not. We anticipate that private payor reimbursement levels will generally be reset in accordance with Medicare payment amounts established through competitive bidding. 
 We cannot predict the full extent to which reimbursement for our products will be affected by competitive bidding, the 2017 federal budget or future federal budgets, or by initiatives to reduce costs for private payors. We believe that we are well positioned to respond to the changing reimbursement environment because our product offerings are innovative, patient-focused and cost-effective. We have historically been able to reduce our costs through scalable manufacturing, better sourcing, continuous innovation, and reliability improvements, as well as innovations that reduce our product service costs by minimizing exchanges, such as user replaceable batteries. As a result of design changes, supplier negotiations, bringing manufacturing and assembly largely in-house and our commitment to driving efficient manufacturing processes, we have reduced our overall system cost 58% from 2009 to 2017. We intend to continue to seek ways to reduce our cost of revenue through manufacturing and design improvements.
 For additional discussion of the impact of the recent competitive bidding proposals, see “Risk Factors” herein.
 Manufacturing and raw materials
 We have been developing and refining the manufacturing of our Inogen One systems since 2004. While nearly all of our manufacturing and assembly processes were originally outsourced, assembly of the compressor, sieve bed, concentrator and certain manifolds is now conducted in-house in order to improve quality control and reduce cost. Additionally, we use lean manufacturing practices to maximize manufacturing efficiency. We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply several components of our Inogen One and Inogen At Home systems. We typically enter into supply agreements for these components that specify quantity and quality requirements and delivery terms. In certain cases, these agreements can be terminated by either party upon relatively short notice but in other instances we are obligated to purchase minimum quantities. We have elected to source certain key components from single sources of supply, including our batteries, motors, valves, and some molded plastic components. We believe that maintaining a single source of supply allows us to control production costs and inventory levels and to manage component quality. In order to mitigate against the risks related to a single source of supply, we qualify alternative suppliers and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions. However, any reduction or halt in supply from one of these single-source suppliers could limit our ability to manufacture our products or devices until a replacement supplier is found and qualified. 
 We currently manufacture in two leased buildings in Goleta, California and Richardson, Texas, that we have registered with the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and for which we have obtained International Standards Organization, or ISO, 13485 certification. We plan to continue the expansion of our facilities located in Richardson, Texas. We also began production of our Inogen One G3 concentrators in the fourth quarter of 2017 using a contract manufacturer, Foxconn, located in the Czech Republic to improve our ability to service our European customers. We believe we and our manufacturing partner have sufficient capacity to meet anticipated demand.
 Our entire organization is responsible for quality management. Our Quality Assurance department oversees this by tracking component, device and organization performance and by training team members outside the Quality Assurance department to become competent users of our Quality Management system. By measuring component performance, communicating daily with the production group and our suppliers, and reviewing customer complaints, our Quality Assurance department, through the use of our corrective action program, drives and documents continuous performance improvement of our suppliers and internal departments. Our Quality Assurance department also trains internal quality auditors to audit our adherence to the Quality Management system. Our Quality Management system has been certified to ISO 13485:2012 by BSI, a Notified Body to ISO. 
 Our manufacturing partner is expected to ramp capacity in 2018 to produce Inogen One G3 concentrators required to support our European demand. We expect to maintain our assembly operations for our Inogen One concentrators and Inogen At Home concentrators at our facility in Richardson, Texas and will continue to assemble compressors and sieve bed columns at our facility in 
 
13


Goleta, California. This will allow us to expand our manufacturing capacity and redirect our U.S. manufacturing activities to focus on growth in the U.S. and on our latest product, the Inogen One G4.
 As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities, including those facilities outside of the United States, are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and certain corresponding state agencies. We have been audited five times since April 2012 by the FDA and found to be in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices. We have completed four surveillance audits and two recertification audits by our notified body over the same period. In addition, two transfer audits (one combined with a surveillance audit tallied above and one standalone) and one site addition audit were also completed. In any given year, we may identify non-conformance and objectionable conditions.  As of December 31, 2017, all observations resulting in non-conformance or objectionable conditions have been minimal and have been corrected. Our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home system have received pre-market clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA.  The modifications made to our Inogen One G2, Inogen One G3, and Inogen One G4 systems represent non-significant modifications to the original Inogen One system, have the same indications for use, and are covered under our initial Inogen One 510(k) clearance.
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 223 employees in operations, manufacturing, quality assurance and repair. 
 Research and development 
 We are committed to ongoing research and development to stay at the forefront of patient preference in the oxygen concentrator field. As of December 31, 2017, our research and development staff included 24 engineers and scientists with expertise in air separation, compressors, pneumatics, electronics, embedded software, mechanical design, sensor, automation, connectivity and manufacturing automation. Our current research and development efforts are focused primarily on increasing functionality, improving design for ease-of-use, and reducing production costs of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems, as well as developing our next-generation oxygen concentrators. Over the last three years, Inogen has invested over $14.6 million in research and development ($5.3, $5.1 and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively) to launch our Inogen One G4, upgrade our Inogen One G3, and introduce our first-generation stationary oxygen concentrator to market. We have leveraged our thirty-one issued U.S. patents and one Canadian patent while also reducing the product manufacturing costs 58% from 2009 to 2017. 
 Utilizing lean product development methodologies, we have released five products since 2004, including our Inogen One G1 in October 2004, our Inogen One G2 in March 2010, our Inogen One G3 in September 2012, our Inogen At Home system in October 2014, and our Inogen One G4 in May 2016.  We are currently developing our next-generation portable oxygen concentrator, the Inogen One G5. Our dedication to continuous improvement has also resulted in five mid-cycle product updates and numerous incremental improvements. Development projects utilize a combination of rapid prototyping and accelerated life testing methods to ensure products are taken from concept to commercialization in a fast and capital efficient manner. We leverage our direct patient expertise to rapidly gain insight from end users and to identify areas of innovation that we believe will lead to higher-quality products and lower total cost of ownership for our products. 
 We continue to focus our efforts on design and functionality improvements that enhance patient quality of life and reduce service costs. 
 Competition 
 The oxygen therapy market is a highly competitive industry. We compete with a number of manufacturers and distributors of portable oxygen concentrators, as well as providers of other oxygen therapy solutions such as home delivery of oxygen tanks or cylinders, stationary concentrators, transfilling concentrators, and liquid oxygen. 
 Our significant manufacturing competitors are Invacare Corporation, Respironics (a subsidiary of Koninklijke Philips N.V.), AirSep Corporation and SeQual Technologies (subsidiaries of Chart Industries, Inc.), ResMed Corp., Drive Medical, O2 Concepts, Precision Medical, and Gas Control Equipment. Given the relatively low barriers to entry in the oxygen therapy device manufacturing market, we expect that the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future. Manufacturing companies compete for sales to providers primarily on the basis of product features, service and price. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, due to our manufacturing competitors’ reliance on home medical equipment distribution, which compresses their margins and limits their ability to invest in product features that address consumer preferences. To pursue a direct-to-consumer strategy, our manufacturing competitors would need to meet national accreditation and state-by-state licensing requirements and secure Medicare billing privileges, as well as compete directly with the home medical equipment providers that many rely on across their entire homecare businesses. For our two largest medical device competitors, the entire oxygen business for each, including stationary and transfilling concentrators, represents less than 15% percent of their billion-dollar plus homecare businesses in 2016. 
 
14


Lincare, Inc. (a subsidiary of the Linde Group), Apria Healthcare, Inc., Rotech Healthcare, Inc. and American HomePatient, Inc. (now a subsidiary of Lincare, Inc.) have been among the market leaders in providing oxygen therapy in the United States for many years, while the remaining U.S. oxygen therapy market is serviced by local or regional providers. Because many oxygen therapy providers were either excluded from contracts in the Medicare competitive bidding process or will have difficulty providing service at the prevailing Medicare reimbursement rates, we expect more industry consolidation. Oxygen therapy providers compete primarily on the basis of product features and service, rather than price, since reimbursement levels are established by Medicare and Medicaid, or by the individual determinations of private payors. We believe that the investment made by oxygen therapy providers in the physical distribution required for oxygen delivery limits their ability to easily switch their business model and employ a solution directly competitive to Inogen. 
 Some of our competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater resources than we have. As a consequence, they are able to spend more aggressively on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. Some of these competitors have: 
  
• | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


• | established relationships with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established distribution networks;
--+-----------------------------------


• | additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts, longer warranties, financing or extended terms, or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater history in conducting research and development, manufacturing, marketing and obtaining regulatory approval for oxygen device products; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, patent litigation and customer financing.

 As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. In light of these advantages that our competitors maintain, even if our technology and direct-to-consumer distribution strategy is more effective than the technology and distribution strategy of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitor products and services in lieu of purchasing our products. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved products and distribution strategies and as new companies enter the market with new technologies and distribution strategies. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations. Our ability to compete successfully and to increase our market share is dependent upon our reputation for providing responsive, professional and high-quality products and services and achieving strong customer satisfaction. Increased competition in the future could adversely affect our revenue, revenue growth rate, margins and market share. 
 Government regulation 
 Inogen One systems, Inogen At Home systems and related accessories are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States and comparable authorities in other countries. The FDA regulations govern the following activities that we perform, or that are performed on our behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses: product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, pre-market clearance or approval, record keeping, product marketing, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and post-marketing surveillance. 
 FDA’s pre-market clearance and approval requirements 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a prior Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or 501(k) clearance or a pre-market approval from the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring premarket approval.

510(k) clearance pathway 
 When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a pre-market approval application. The performance goal for FDA to make a decision is within 90 FDA Days (calculated as the number of calendar days between the date the 510(k) was received and date of a decision, excluding the days the submission was on hold for an Additional Information request). As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. The FDA must “accept” the submission and may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared device or use, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use, into Class III. We obtained 510(k) clearance for the original Inogen One system on May 13, 2004. We market the Inogen One G2, Inogen One G3, and Inogen One G4 systems pursuant to the original Inogen One 510(k) clearance. We obtained 510(k) clearance for the Inogen At Home system on June 20, 2014.
 Pre-market approval pathway 
 A pre-market approval application must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The pre-market approval application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A pre-market approval application must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device. 
 After a pre-market approval application is submitted and the FDA determines that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will accept the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review an “accepted” pre-market approval application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulations. 
 Clinical trials 
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support pre-market approval and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States, these trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites. We, the FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the product. 
 Pervasive and ongoing regulation by the FDA and foreign agencies
 Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 
  
• | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
16


 
• | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 After a device receives 510(k) clearance or a pre-market approval, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. We have modified various aspects of our Inogen One systems since receiving regulatory clearance, but we believe that new 510(k) clearances are not required for these modifications. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties. 
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, rescinding previously granted 510(k) clearances or withdrawing previously granted pre-market approvals. 
 As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and certain corresponding state agencies. We have been audited five times since April 2012 by the FDA and found to be in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices. We have completed four surveillance audits and two recertification audits by our notified body over the same period and identified four minor non-conformances, all of which were addressed. In addition, two transfer audits (one combined with a surveillance audit tallied above and one standalone) and one site addition audit were also completed.
 International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries. 
 Licensure, registrations, and accreditation 
 In April 2009, we became an accredited Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies Medicare supplier by Accreditation Commission for Health Care for our Goleta, California facility for Home/Durable Medical Equipment Services for oxygen equipment and supplies. Our Medicare accreditation must be renewed every three years by passing an on-site inspection. Our current accreditation with Medicare is due to expire in May 2018. Several states require that durable medical equipment providers be licensed in order to sell products to patients in that state. Certain of these states require that durable medical equipment providers maintain an in-state location. Most of our state licenses are renewed on an annual or bi-annual basis. Although we believe we are in compliance with all applicable state regulations regarding licensure requirements, if we were found to be non-compliant, we could lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future products to patients in that state. Loss of any state licensure may also impact our Medicare enrollment, which requires us to be properly licensed in every state where we are registered with Medicare to do business.  Loss or reprimand of our Medicare enrollment may also affect any Medicare Competitive Bidding Program Contracts we currently possess.  In addition, we are subject to certain state laws regarding professional licensure. We believe that our certified clinicians are in compliance with all such state laws. If our clinicians were to be found non-compliant in a given state, we would need to modify our approach to providing education, clinical support and customer service in such state. 
 Federal anti-kickback and self-referral laws 
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for, or to induce the: 
  
• | referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
17


The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute applies to our arrangements with our United States sales representatives, customers and healthcare providers, as well as certain coding and billing information that we may provide to purchasers of our Inogen One and Inogen At Home systems. Although we believe that we have structured such arrangements to be in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and other applicable laws, regulatory authorities may determine otherwise. Non-compliance with the federal anti-kickback statute can result in cancellation of our provider numbers and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, as well as civil and criminal penalties, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Federal law also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law,” which prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services,” which includes durable medical equipment, if the physician or immediate family member of the physician, has an ownership or investment interest or compensation arrangement with such entity that does not comply with the requirements of a Stark exception. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a non-compliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Although we believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements, these arrangements may not expressly meet the requirements for applicable exceptions from the law. 
 Additionally, as some of these laws are still evolving, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider arrangements may ultimately be found to be not in compliance with applicable federal law. 
 Federal False Claims Act 
 The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment to the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” or whistleblower lawsuits against companies. Although we believe that we are in compliance with the federal government’s laws and regulations, if we are found in violation of these laws, penalties include fines ranging from $0.011 to $0.022 million for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act. We believe that we are in compliance with the federal government’s laws and regulations concerning the filing of reimbursement claims. 
 Civil monetary penalties law 
 The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. We sometimes offer customers various discounts and other financial incentives in connection with the sales of our products. While it is our intent to comply with all applicable laws, the government may find that our marketing activities violate the Civil Monetary Penalties Law. If we are found to be in non-compliance, we could be subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs. In addition, to the extent we are found to not be in compliance, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 State fraud and abuse provisions 
 Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and false claims act that may apply to all payors. We believe that we are in compliance with such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 
 HIPAA 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are referred to as “covered entities.” Three standards have been promulgated under HIPAA’s regulations: the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, which restrict the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information, the Standards for Electronic Transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures, and the Security Standards, which require covered entities to 
 
18


implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard certain electronic health information, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. 
 In 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, which included sweeping changes to HIPAA, including an expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. ARRA includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, which, among other things, made HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates of covered entities effective February 17, 2010. A business associate is a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information in connection with recognized healthcare operations activities. As a result, business associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable standards. Moreover, HITECH creates a new requirement to report certain breaches of unsecured, individually identifiable health information and imposes penalties on entities that fail to do so. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The 2013 final HITECH omnibus rule modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that will likely make more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. 
 In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws. If we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions. Any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA, HITECH or state privacy and security statutes or regulations could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our results or operations. 
 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on medical device manufacturers for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.  Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $0.15 million per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission.  Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also requires healthcare providers to voluntarily report and return an identified overpayment within 60 days after identifying the overpayment. Failure to repay the overpayment within 60 days will result in the claim being considered a “false claim” and the healthcare provider will be subject to False Claims Act liability.
 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 Also, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, manufacturers, distributors, partners, collaborators or agents.  Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in legal fees, fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
 International regulation 
 International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain clearance or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may be different. 
 The primary regulatory body in Europe is the European Commission, which has adopted numerous directives and has promulgated standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the European Conformity Marking, or CE Mark, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the European Union, and other countries that comply with or mirror these directives. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a notified body, an independent and neutral 
 
19


institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system, review of technical documentation, and specific testing of the manufacturer’s device. Such an assessment may be required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout these countries. ISO 13485 certification is a voluntary standard. Quality systems that implement relevant harmonized standards establish the presumption of conformity with the essential requirements for a CE Mark. We have the authorization to affix the CE Mark to our products and to commercialize our devices in the European Union. Our ISO 13485 certification was issued on April 21, 2005 and our EC-Certificate was issued on March 16, 2007. The final form of the European Medical Device Regulation, which will replace Europe’s Medical Device Directive, was adopted on May 25, 2017 and it becomes effective on May 25, 2020. The Medical Device Regulation will apply in parallel with the Medical Device Directive for a transition period of three years. Additionally, a new version of ISO 13485 was recently published, beginning a transition period for updating certificates until March 2019.
 Before we can sell our devices in Canada we must submit a license application and obtain clearance, implement and comply with ISO Standard 13485, and undergo an audit by a registrar accredited by Health Canada. On January 25, 2006, we received our Medical Device License in Canada. Health Canada intends to implement the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) as the sole mechanism for manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with the quality management system requirements of the Medical Devices Regulations. MDSAP will replace the current Canadian Medical Devices Conformity Assessment System (CMDCAS) program. As of January 1, 2019, only MDSAP certificates will be accepted. In Australia, we must appoint an agent sponsor who will interact on our behalf with the Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA). We must also prepare a technical file and declaration of conformity to essential requirements under Australian law, provide evidence of CE Marking of the device and submit this information via our agent sponsor to the TGA in a Medical Device Application. On June 4, 2007, we received our Certificate for Inclusion of a Medical Device in Australia. 
 Intellectual property 
 We believe that to maintain a competitive advantage, we must develop and preserve the proprietary aspect of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. Currently, we require our employees, public accountants, consultants and advisors to execute non-disclosure agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationships with us, where appropriate. We also require our employees, consultants and advisors with whom we expect to work on our current or future products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the work day, developed using our property or related to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our Inogen One or Inogen At Home systems or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 
 Patents 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had seven pending U.S. patent applications, thirty-one issued U.S. patents and one issued Canadian patent relating to the design and construction of our oxygen concentrators and our intelligent delivery technology. We anticipate it could take several years for the most recent of these U.S. patent applications to result in issued patents, if successful. 
 Our patent portfolio contains three principal sets of patents and patent applications. The first set relates to the construction and design of specific Inogen products. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 8,440,004; 8,366,815; 8,377,181; and 8,568,519 are directed to design elements of the Inogen One G2 portable oxygen concentrator. These patents expire in 2031 (without taking into account any patent term adjustments) and may serve to deter competitors from reverse engineering or copying our design elements. This set of patents and patent applications also contains pending U.S. patent applications that relate to the designs of the Inogen One G3, Inogen One G4, and Inogen At Home oxygen concentrators. 
 The second set of patents and patent applications within our portfolio pertains to operating algorithms and design optimization techniques. U.S. Patent Nos. 7,841,343; 7,585,351; 7,857,894; 8,142,544; and 6,605,136 are directed toward optimization of the Pressure Swing Adsorption oxygen generating system and the oxygen conserving technology used across all of our products. These patents expire in 2027, 2026, 2027, 2026 and 2022 respectively (without taking into account any patent term adjustments). These algorithms and optimization techniques are developed to facilitate the design and manufacturing of our products. These patents may prevent competitors from achieving the same levels of optimization as found in our products. 
 The third set of patents and patent applications includes system component designs that may be incorporated into our products. For example, U.S. Patent No. 8,580,015, which expires in 2027 (without taking into account any patent term adjustments), is directed to product improvements that have been utilized in the Inogen One and Inogen One G2 products. Also, within this class of patents are U.S. Patent Nos. 7,686,870 and 7,922,789 that are directed to designs that may be utilized in future Inogen products to improve performance over current product offerings. These patents expire in 2027 and 2023 respectively (without taking into account any patent term adjustments).

We own trademark registrations for the mark “G4” in Europe (European Union registration) and the United Kingdom. Other service marks, trademarks, and trade names referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 770 full and part-time employees, representing 381 in sales, marketing, clinical and client services, 223 in operations, manufacturing, quality assurance and repair, 142 in general administration and 24 in research and development. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our employee relations are good. 
 Environmental matters 
 Our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including flammables, toxics, and corrosives. Our research and manufacturing operations produce hazardous chemical waste products. We seek to comply with applicable laws regarding the handling and disposal of such materials. Given the small volume of such materials used or generated at our facilities, we do not expect our compliance efforts to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We do not currently maintain separate environmental liability coverage and any such contamination or discharge could result in significant cost to us in penalties, damages, and suspension of our operations. 
 Backlog 
 We run our operations on a just-in-time basis; however, the volatility of order intake may result in periods when incoming orders exceed our capacity.  We do not currently have a backlog of orders that could not be fulfilled in our ordinary course of business.  Further, our customers can change or cancel orders with limited or no penalty and limited advance notice prior to shipment.
 Geographic information
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, substantially all of our long-lived assets were located within the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, all of our long-lived assets were located within the United States.  Approximately 22.3% of our 2017 revenue, 24.7% of our 2016 revenue, and 22.2% of our 2015 revenue came from international markets. See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our U.S. and non-U.S. revenue. 
 Seasonality
 We believe our sales may be impacted by seasonal factors. For example, we typically experience higher total sales in the second and third quarter, as a result of consumers traveling and vacationing during warmer weather in the spring and summer months, but this may vary year-over-year. As more home medical equipment (HME) providers adopt portable oxygen concentrators in their businesses, we expect our historical seasonality in the domestic business-to-business channel could change as well, which was previously influenced mainly by consumer buying patterns.  Direct-to-consumer sales seasonality may also be impacted by the number of sales representatives and the amount of marketing spend in each quarter. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the sales revenue in the second quarter accounted for 25.7%, 27.1% and 28.5%, respectively, and the sales revenue in the third quarter accounted for 28.0%, 28.1% and 25.7%, respectively, of our total sales revenue.
