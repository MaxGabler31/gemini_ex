Item 1. Business.
Overview of Our Company

Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. (Nasdaq: CCRN) is a market leading workforce solutions tech-enabled staffing, recruitment, and advisory firm that has 35 years of industry experience and insight. We solve complex labor-related challenges for customers while providing high-quality outcomes and exceptional patient care. As a multi-year Best of Staffing® award winner, we are committed to an exceptionally high level of service to both our clients and our healthcare professionals. Our Company was the first publicly traded staffing firm to obtain The Joint Commission Certification, which we still hold with a Letter of Distinction. In 2021, we were listed as one of the top four staffing and recruiting employers for women by InHerSights and earned Energage's inaugural 2021 Top Workplaces USA award. We were also CertifiedTM by Great Place to Work®. We have a longstanding history of investing in diversity, equality, and inclusion as a key component of the organization’s overall corporate social responsibility program which is closely aligned with its core values to create a better future for its people, communities, the planet, and its stockholders.
Leveraging national and in-market staffing teams, we place highly qualified healthcare professionals in virtually every specialty on travel and per diem assignments, local short-term contracts, and permanent positions. We also place teachers, substitute teachers, and other education specialties at educational facilities. Our diverse customer base includes both public and private acute care and non-acute care hospitals, outpatient clinics, ambulatory care facilities, single and multi-specialty physician practices, rehabilitation facilities, Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) programs, urgent care centers, local and national healthcare systems, managed care providers, public and charter schools, correctional facilities, government facilities, pharmacies, and many other healthcare providers. By utilizing the solutions we offer, customers are able to better plan their personnel needs, optimize their talent acquisition and management processes, strategically flex and balance their workforce, have access quality healthcare personnel, and provide continuity of care for improved patient outcomes. We believe that our national footprint provides a unique value proposition, as we are able to engage with a broader pool of talent and offer customers a more consultative approach relying on our understanding of the local markets they serve.
The healthcare staffing industry continues to evolve, with both healthcare providers and professionals demanding speed and placing heavier reliance on technology for fulfillment and delivery activities. According to the AKASA 2021 Annual Report on Automation, more than 66% of health systems and hospitals currently use automation tools for revenue cycle operations.
Recognizing this trend, we are continuing on a path of digital transformation and innovation across our business with continuous investments in expanding our technology capabilities both on the candidate engagement and customer facing fronts. Areas of investment include recruitment and candidate nurturing tools, market analytics, a subscription platform, mobile applications and self-serve capabilities, programmatic advertising, social media, and other technology. These investments enhance our recruiting capabilities and allow us to quickly respond to demand across a wide range of specialties.
In 2021, we successfully enhanced our applicant tracking system (ATS) for our travel business and upgraded Cross Country Marketplace, our proprietary on-demand staffing platform, which is a one-stop, self-service portal for healthcare professionals that has greatly improved the candidate experience and lead generation. The ATS has continued to improve the efficiency and candidate conversion ratios and is just one component of our larger technology ecosystem that will drive greater productivity as well as growth in both revenue and profitability. In 2022, we intend to continue enhancing and further deploying our ATS. We are also continuing to build out a complete self-service portal that candidates can use across the entire engagement life cycle. In addition, in December 2021, we acquired the assets of Selected, Inc., our first subscription model which allows educators to review candidate profiles and self-select candidates for permanent job opportunities. We believe this model can be applied across the enterprise to offer clients another way to hire permanent staff.
We have executed multiple initiatives to enhance our position as a leading, consultative, and strategic partner in the healthcare industry. Some of our key focus areas included personalizing the candidate experience, delivering a superior customer experience, infusing technology-enablement to drive efficiencies and increased productivity, and continuing our commitment to clinical excellence. As part of our growth strategy, we continue to optimize technologies by upgrading and integrating our middle and back-office platforms, and bringing our IT infrastructure and business processes onto a single cohesive platform. We expect these initiatives to drive growth through better operational execution, enhanced productivity, and a world-class client and candidate experience. In 2021, and with more than 35 registered clinicians on our corporate staff, we established a Clinical Quality Council which serves as an advisory committee to our entire organization and our clients.
One of our goals is also to continue to grow shareholder value by continuing to deepen our relationship with current customers and healthcare professionals, expanding the number and types of new customers we serve, growing the supply and types of specialties of our healthcare professionals, improving our operating leverage through growth and cost containment, and strengthening and broadening our market presence. This will require our continued focus on: (i) providing our workforce solutions offerings to new customers; (ii) expanding the services we provide to our current customers; (iii) further diversifying our customer base; (iv) improving our capture rate for current managed service programs (defined below) customers; (v) accessing more candidates; and (vi) continuing to modernize our technologies and processes to optimize our relationships with our healthcare professionals and customers.
To successfully execute our business strategy, we rely on our experienced and innovative executive and operational teams. Our executive team has extensive experience in the staffing, workforce solutions, technology services, and healthcare industries. We also foster a culture of performance, talented leadership, and collegiality that promotes the achievement of both company and personal goals. In both 2020 and 2021, the Company's Co-Founder & Chief Executive Officer was named to the Staffing Industry Analysts’ Staffing 100 List of the most notable leaders in the industry. Two other executives were included on Staffing Industry Analysts’ 2021 Global Power 150 - Women in Staffing List that recognizes the 100 most influential women in the Americas and 50 additional women internationally. One of those executives was also included in 2020 and 2019. We also have a female leader that became the first locum tenens director elected to the National Association Medical Staff Services Board of Directors. In addition, the Company's Chief Clinical Officer joined the Joint Commission’s Healthcare Staffing Advisory Council, a newly formed committee of staffing experts to help evaluate healthcare organizations.
COVID and Our Business
The COVID pandemic has continued to challenge the nation and our industry, and has highlighted the need to continue to innovate, improve our processes, and expand our services to meet the needs of our patients, employees, and our clients. We are more nimble and operationally efficient than we have ever been in the history of the Company through improved diversity that fosters more ideas, enhanced communications and connections, and in many other ways. A healthcare workforce shortage has been compounded by the current economy and the variants of COVID that have plagued the country for the past several months, but we were able to successfully hire more than one thousand corporate employees in 2021 due to our positive reputation, strong culture, and improved financial performance. We believe that if we take care of our people and our communities, the rest will follow, and this has resonated with both employees and clients. This mindset was a critical component that has helped us navigate through the pandemic.
The pandemic has continued to reinforce our value proposition in the market for offering a flexible, rapid, and cost-effective means for delivering critical care to millions of Americans across thousands of facilities. It has also caused us to rely on our foundational values of integrity, respect, transparency and fairness to ensure we are helping our clients at a time they need us most. We believe this will allow us to deliver the best long-term value to clients, candidates, and stockholders. Ensuring the health and safety of our employees has been paramount. While operating primarily through a remote workforce, our offices are open with stringent safety guidelines and procedures in place, including allowing only vaccinated employees on-site, social 
distancing, and enhanced cleaning at all of our locations. Business travel, including visits to our healthcare clients, continues to be somewhat limited as some clients are continuing to cope with the pandemic twenty-four hours a day/seven days a week; however, our sales team is traveling to clients that are currently seeing some relief.
Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to partner with our clients to deliver flexible solutions aimed at solving their immediate and long-term challenges. We provide data, industry insights, marketing analytics, and consulting services to assist clients in determining the appropriate rates necessary to attract the supply they need. Relying on our foundational values of integrity, respect, transparency and fairness, we are helping our clients at a time they need us most. We believe this will allow us to deliver the best long-term value to clients, candidates, and stockholders. As part of our COVID response, our cross-functional team ensures rapid response to our customers’ needs and deploys a set of pricing guidelines to ensure we deliver services at what we believe are competitive rates. As a result, we successfully staffed thousands of highly-qualified professionals on COVID response assignments again in 2021. Despite the inherent burn-out in the nursing profession, the politics, and varying governmental regulations, our healthcare professionals exemplify compassion and dedication while continuing to care for COVID and other patients on the front lines every day, often times at personal risk.
The pandemic has significantly exacerbated labor shortages in the country, and the dynamics drove a significant increase in the compensation costs for healthcare professionals. Our company has taken steps to absorb as much of the increased cost as possible, while still being responsible to our stockholders. In our capacity as a national staffing company, we do not dictate bill rates, nor set the pay rates for professionals. We evaluate the market conditions and advise our clients on what we believe to be the necessary bill rate that ensures they will have the vital clinicians needed to deliver the highest quality of care to the millions of patients they treat each year. Nurses especially have seen the highest rise in their compensation during the pandemic, which has been fueled by heightened demand across most specialties as health systems struggle to maintain adequate core staff levels for a variety of reasons. Though we certainly can’t predict how or when rates will moderate, the talent shortage is likely to persist, and depending on demand both bill and pay rates are likely to remain elevated in the short-term. Regardless of how rates evolve, we are committed to continue growing our base of clinicians on assignment and growing our market share.
We believe there are five lessons we must keep top of mind as we face another wave of COVID surge cases: (i) Embrace science and show compassion for others. We must embrace the science, but we must also embrace one another and understand all viewpoints. (ii) Innovate, adapt, and provide value. We need to integrate innovation into everyday practices to meet the increasing demand for care, such as telemedicine. (iii) Acknowledge the mental health impact. We need to acknowledge the very real and lasting mental health difficulties brought on by this pandemic and provide thoughtful support to our doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals during these difficult times. (iv) Support care across state lines. A mobile workforce can also aid clinician burnout and fill gaps in care. The pandemic further highlighted the need for national licensure so clinicians can cross state lines to provide care in areas of greater demand. (v) Remain transparent and practice with integrity. Ethical practice is a key component to running a business with integrity, and we know that we are doing the right thing for our customers and the patients they serve.
Corporate Social Responsibility
The Company believes in the impact of corporate sustainability and the responsible use of resources in consideration of future generations. Our Board of Directors has direct oversight of ESG matters, which include health, safety, social, and environmental issues, and is regularly briefed by senior management on these subjects. 
Our goal is to provide work conditions that enable employees to thrive in an environment that is healthy and reduces hazards and health and safety issues, as well as raising awareness on health and safety risks related to our business activities. As part of our health and safety program, we partner with employees to help them achieve both their physical and mental welfare by providing education on health topics, facilitating complementary health screenings, and offering resources that include a confidential support line. We foster a sound, respectful, fair, and inclusive workplace. Our culture is also infused with a growth mindset that encourages employee internal progression and retention through an array of learning and coaching resources. Employees are also held to the ethics standards set forth in our Code of Ethics policies, which also apply to vendors and suppliers.
Our goal is also to provide a clean, safe, and healthy workplace for our employees and to help preserve the environment of the communities we serve by monitoring and mitigating any undesired effect of our business activities on the environment. For many years, the Company has been committed to supporting our communities through several charities as well. We remain a loyal supporter of the American Red Cross, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Random Acts of Flowers, Palm Beach Country School Board, and Spirit of Giving Holiday Gift Drive, among others.
 Services
Increasingly, we are called upon by our customers to provide creative and innovative talent sourcing strategies across a continuum of care. Over the past several years, our workforce solutions have evolved into a total talent management approach as our customers focus on maintaining high-quality patient outcomes, while improving their total labor management to address complex financial, compliance, and other challenges in the healthcare industry. As part of the evolution of our services, we consider the following: (i) solving the immediate and future needs of our customers and expanding our relationships with them; (ii) enhancing our network of healthcare professionals by improving their experience, and deepening our relationship with them; (iii) expanding our service offerings to reduce sensitivity to economic cycles; (iv) expanding our expertise with various healthcare solutions in various geographic areas of the U.S.; (v) continuing to diversify our customer base to enhance our long-term business prospects; and (vi) enhancing and expanding our technology capabilities to deliver efficient and automated services to our customer healthcare facilities. Today, our workforce solutions include:
•Managed Service Programs (MSPs). As healthcare providers continue to adopt centralized, outsourced models for managing contingent labor for both clinical and non-clinical needs, we offer an MSP in which we manage all or a portion of the customer’s staffing needs. This includes both the placement of our own healthcare professionals and the utilization of other staffing agencies to fulfill the customer’s staffing needs. We have been a market leader in this area since launching our first MSP in 2003, and over the years, we have grown our relationships and matured the generational models of MSPs. Today, we service more than 80 customers across more than 700 facilities, with estimated spend under management of approximately $1.1 billion annually. The benefits to our customers include cost optimization, increased certainty of supply, and visibility into their labor needs and usage, as well as market insight from our industry expertise on a broad range of topics. 
•Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO). Through our RPO services, we offer our customers targeted recruitment solutions designed to increase core staff while reducing dependency on contract labor. Our RPO program provides support to replace or complement a customer’s existing internal recruitment functions for permanent hiring needs, and is delivered to healthcare organizations throughout the country and serves to provide creative, cost and operationally efficient hiring support and labor optimization, which leads to improvements in quality of care.
•Project Management. Periodically, our clients have urgent needs that fall outside the scope of an MSP arrangement and require a more focused effort to place staff within a very short window. For example, as healthcare systems continue to upgrade their electronic medical records or encounter a labor disruption, we can provide comprehensive project management, a deployment of a full staffing plan, and ultimately an organized volume of quality healthcare professionals during the process so that our customers may continue to deliver quality care.
•Retained and Contingent Search. Similar to RPO, we seek to identify and place candidates in full-time roles with our clients, across clinical and executive or administrative functions. These services are offered for specific roles and depending on the client’s needs will be contracted either on a retainer basis, with guaranteed fees or a contingent basis, which has a success fee once the placement has occurred.
•Other Services. Though not a material part of our business, we offer clients other value-added services such as Internal Resource Pool Consulting & Development (IRP), and Optimal Workforce Solutions (OWS). These services seek to augment our client’s capabilities with managing, supplementing and outsourcing aspects of their internal processes of managing their workforce.
In 2021, we modified our disclosures of reportable segments to better align with our management structure and to reflect how the operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. As a result, our business now consists of two business segments: Nurse and Allied Staffing and Physician Staffing, and the results of the previously-reported Search segment have been consolidated within Nurse and Allied Staffing. For additional information concerning our business segments, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Segment Results. Through our business segments, we provide our healthcare customers with a wide range of solutions as described above and staffing services as set forth below.

(1)Nursing and Allied Staffing. The Nurse and Allied Staffing segment provides workforce solutions and traditional staffing, recruiting, and value-added total talent solutions, including temporary and permanent placement of travel and local nurse and allied professionals, managed services programs (MSP) services, education healthcare services, in-home care services, and outsourcing services. We also serve as a direct-hire talent acquisition partner to healthcare organizations and academic institutions throughout the nation providing a full suite of prescriptive talent management solutions, including flexible talent delivery models such as retained, outsourced, and contingent. Our Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue and contribution income is set forth in Note 18 - Segment Data to the consolidated financial statements.
A majority of our revenue is generated from staffing registered nurses on long-term travel contract assignments (typically, 13 weeks in length) at hospitals and health systems. Additionally, we staff registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, certified nurse assistants, advanced practitioners, pharmacists, and more than 100 specialties of allied professionals on local per diem and short-term assignments in a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings. We also provide clinical and non-clinical professionals on long-term assignments to clients such as public and private acute-care and non-acute care hospitals, government facilities, public schools and charter schools, outpatient clinics, ambulatory care facilities, physician practice groups, local and national healthcare plans, managed care providers, correctional facilities, and many other healthcare providers. In June 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Workforce Solutions Group, Inc. (WSG), which allows us to deliver critical support to some of the neediest populations by delivering professionals to the home.
(2)Physician Staffing. Our Physician Staffing segment provides licensed practitioners across a broad array of specialties, as well as certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), nurse practitioners (NPs), and physician assistants (PAs) under our Cross Country Locums® brand on temporary assignments throughout the United States. The diverse list of clients we serve include healthcare facilities, such as acute and non-acute care facilities, medical group practices, government facilities, and managed care organizations. We recruit these professionals nationally and place them on assignments varying in length from several days up to one year. Our Physician Staffing revenue and contribution income is set forth in Note 18 - Segment Data to the consolidated financial statements.
Our Business Model
The recruitment and retention of a sufficient number of qualified healthcare professionals to work temporary assignments on our behalf is critical to the success of our business. Healthcare professionals choose temporary assignments for a variety of reasons that include seeking flexible work opportunities, seeking higher compensation, exploring diverse practice settings, building skills and experience by working at prestigious healthcare facilities, working through life and career transitions, and as a means of access into a permanent staff position all while practicing in the most appreciated and highly altruistic trade.
(1)Our Healthcare Professionals. Our company is well positioned to attract candidates, as clinical professionals routinely seek a wide range of diverse assignments in attractive locations, with competitive compensation and benefit packages, scheduling options, as well as a high level of service. In addition, we believe nurses and allied professionals are confident we will be able to offer them new assignments as they complete their current assignment. Each of our nurse and allied healthcare professionals is employed by us and is typically paid hourly wages and any other benefits they are entitled to receive during the assignment period. In addition, our competitive benefits generally include professional liability insurance, a 401(k) plan, health insurance, reimbursed travel, per diem allowances, and housing. In response to COVID, our Company frequently offers qualified healthcare professionals compensation during quarantine when they have tested positive for the virus.
Recruiters are an essential element of our Nurse and Allied Staffing business, and are responsible for establishing and maintaining key relationships with candidates for the duration of their assignments. Leveraging our database of clinicians and artificial intelligence, recruiters match the supply of qualified candidates with the demand for open orders from our customers. While word-of-mouth and referrals, especially from current and former healthcare professionals we have placed, continue as our leading channel of access to candidates, we also market our brands through strategic sourcing initiatives including programmatic strategic sourcing and extensive utilization of social media and mobile applications, which has become an increasingly important component of our recruitment efforts. In addition to maintaining engaging and intuitive websites to allow potential applicants to obtain information about our Company and assignment opportunities, in 2020, we launched Cross Country Marketplace, our proprietary on-demand staffing platform, as a one-stop, self-service portal to support the candidates throughout their experience with Cross Country, and are continuing to build out as a complete self-service portal that candidates can use across the entire engagement life cycle. In 2020, we also implemented our applicant tracking system for our travel business, which is designed to modernize the way our delivery teams operate while improving the experience of our candidates, with 
further deployments scheduled during the coming year. In 2021, we acquired Selected, an innovative subscription-based platform that allows educational centers to review thousands of screened candidates for direct hire.
Cross Country Locums recruits and contracts with physicians and advanced practice professionals to provide medical services for its healthcare customers. Physician or advanced practice professionals are independent contractors and enter into agreements with Cross Country Locums to provide medical services at a particular healthcare facility or physician practice group based on terms and conditions specified by that customer, for assignments ranging from a few days up to a year. California is the only state to mandate that Advanced Practitioners be treated as a W-2 employee. We believe physicians are attracted to us because we offer a wide variety of assignments, competitive fees, medical malpractice insurance, and a high level of service.
(2)Sales and Marketing. We take an enterprise sales approach in marketing our full capabilities across the continuum of care to hospitals, healthcare facilities, schools, and other organizations across the United States addressing total talent management needs. We provide flexible workforce solutions to the healthcare and school markets customizing delivery of diversified offerings meeting the specific needs of each customer.
Our traditional staffing channels include temporary and permanent placement of travel nurses and allied professionals, local nurses and allied staffing, advanced practitioners, physicians, and substitute teachers through the delivery brands including Cross Country Nurses®, Cross Country Allied®, Cross Country Medical Staffing Network®, Cross Country Search®, Cross Country Workforce Solutions Group®, and Cross Country Education®. Our recruiters leverage the Company’s extensive databases of clinicians and healthcare professionals, as well as their expertise in their given specialties, to qualify and place candidates.
(3)Credentialing and Quality Management. We screen all of our candidates prior to placement through our credentialing departments. Our credentialing processes are designed to ensure that our professionals have the requisite skillsets required by our customers, as well as the aptitude to meet the day-to-day requirements and challenges they would typically encounter on assignments where they are placed. The credentialing of our nurse and allied healthcare professionals is designed to align with the guidelines of The Joint Commission, a national accrediting body, to ensure quality care. Our Cross Country University division, accredited by the American Nurse Credentialing Center, offers training, assessment, and professional development to further ensure the quality of the personnel we place on assignment. Our physician credentialing entity, Credent, is also certified by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA).
(4)Payment for Services. We negotiate payment for services with our customers based on market conditions and needs. We generally bill our nurse and allied employees at an hourly rate which includes all employer costs, including payroll, withholding taxes, benefits, professional liability insurance, meals and incidentals, and other requirements, as well as any travel and housing arrangements, where applicable. Our shared service center processes hours worked by field employees in the time and attendance systems, which in turn generate the billable transactions to our customers. Hours worked by independent contractor physicians are reported to our Cross Country Locums office. Billing for other services such as RPO, Search, or Project Management vary depending on the contract, but typically are invoiced upon the success of achieving agreed upon milestones or completion of specific deliverables, such as the placement of a candidate. On occasion we are able to bill for the reimbursement of certain expenses incurred, such candidate marketing costs or set-up fees incurred for certain projects such as travel costs for internal staff. 
(5)Operations. Our businesses are operated through a relatively centralized business model servicing all assignment needs of our healthcare professional employees, physicians, and customer healthcare facilities primarily through operation centers located in Boca Raton, Florida; Woodland Hills, California; Lake Forest, California; and Berkeley Lake, Georgia. In addition to the key sales and recruitment activities, certain of these centers also perform support activities such as coordinating housing, payroll processing, benefits administration, billing and collections, travel reimbursement processing, customer service, and risk management.
(6)Information Systems. Various information systems are utilized to run our customer relationship management, recruitment, and placement functions based on our different brands. Some of these sophisticated applications are proprietary and are hosted in Tier 1 hosting facilities while other systems are Software as a Service (SaaS) based and hosted by our vendor partners. Our systems maintain detailed information about our customer required skillsets and status which assist us in enabling fulfillment and assignment renewals. Our databases contain an extensive pool of existing and potential customers and all related recruitment and sales activity. Our financial and human resource systems are managed on leading enterprise resource planning software suites that manage certain aspects of accounts payable, accounts receivable, general ledger, billing, and human capital management. We manage our information 
systems with internal team members located both in the United States and in India. Cybersecurity remains a central focus point across our organization, with dedicated resources, iterative training for all employees, as well as a reliance on third parties engaged to assist us in monitoring and managing systems and devices, as well as detecting cyber threats and preventing breaches.
(7)Risk Management, Insurance, and Benefits. Our risk management program is designed to ensure prompt notification of incidents by customers, clinicians, and independent contractors, educational training to our employees, loss analysis, and prompt reporting procedures to reduce our risk of exposure. While we cannot predict the future, we continuously review facts and incidents associated with professional liability and workers’ compensation claims in order to identify trends and reduce our risk of loss in the future where possible. We consider assessments provided by our customers and we work with clinicians and experts from our insurance carriers to determine employment eligibility and potential exposure.
We provide workers’ compensation insurance coverage, professional liability coverage, and healthcare benefits for our eligible employed temporary professionals. We record estimates of the ultimate cost of, and reserves for, workers' compensation and professional liability benefits based on actuarial models prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary using our loss history as well as industry statistics. In determining our reserves, we include reserves for estimated claims incurred but not reported. On a quarterly basis, we estimate the healthcare claims that have occurred but have not been reported based on our historical claim submission patterns. The ultimate cost of workers’ compensation, professional liability, and health insurance claims will depend on actual amounts incurred to settle those claims and may differ from the amounts reserved for such claims.
The Company maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability, workers’ compensation, fidelity, employment practices liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, cyber, property, and professional liability policies. These policies provide coverage subject to their terms, conditions, limits of liability, and deductibles, for certain liabilities that may arise from our operations. There can be no assurance that any of the above policies will be adequate for our needs, or that we will maintain all such policies in the future.
Our Geographic Markets and Client Base
In 2021, 2020, and 2019, primarily all of our revenue was generated in the United States, and all of our long-lived assets were located in the United States and India. We provide our staffing services and workforce solutions in all 50 states. During 2021, the largest percentage of our revenue was concentrated in Florida, California, New York, and Texas. We provide services to public and private acute care and non-acute care hospitals, outpatient clinics, ambulatory care facilities, single and multi-specialty physician practices, rehabilitation facilities, urgent care centers, public and charter schools, correctional facilities, government facilities, retailers, and many other healthcare providers. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
Our Industry

We primarily compete in the U.S. temporary healthcare staffing and workforce solutions markets. Staffing Industry Analysts September 2021 report estimates the healthcare staffing markets had an aggregate market size of $24.7 billion in 2021, of which $11.8 billion was travel nursing, $4.6 billion was per diem nursing, $4.4 billion was allied health, and $4.0 billion was locum tenens and advanced practitioners. The demand for our services is impacted by many factors, of which we believe the most significant are the following:
Supply and Demand Drivers
Economic Backdrop. In November 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total national unemployment rate was 4.2%, while temporary help services gained 6,200 jobs for the month of November 2021. According to the Staffing Industry Analysts “US Staffing Industry Pulse Survey Report" (November 2021), travel nurse staffing continued its run of COVID-spurred dominance, with median year-over-year revenue growth greater than 100%, per diem nursing up 48%, and allied healthcare up 42%. It is anticipated that the U.S. staffing industry will grow in 2022 by 4% to $163.8 billion, as economic conditions normalize, although the ongoing pandemic continues to pose some degree of risk and uncertainty to the outlook, according to Staffing Industry Analysts “US Staffing Industry Forecast: September 2021 Update” (September 7, 2021). However, it is estimated that the healthcare staffing segment will decline by 9% next year, assuming easing of the pandemic and fewer assignments with crisis pay rates, with declines in the travel nurse and per diem nurse segments, but continued growth in locum tenens and allied healthcare staffing.
Increased Need for Healthcare and Special Education Services in Schools. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), enacted in 1975, mandates that children and youth ages 3-21 with disabilities be provided a free and appropriate public school education. According to the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistic Report titled “The Condition of Education" (May 25, 2021), in 2019-20, the number of students ages 3-21 who received special education services under the IDEA was 7.3 million, or 14% of all public school students. The IDEA requires that these children and young adults receive care from speech language pathologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses and other healthcare professionals while at school. According to the U.S. Department of Education report dated September 28, 2020, no matter what primary instructional delivery approach is chosen (remote/distance, in-person, hybrid) in response to COVID, each child with disabilities must be provided a free appropriate public education. Based on the foregoing, we believe the demand for consulting and healthcare staffing services for public schools and charter schools will continue to be strong for agencies that can provide consulting services, healthcare personnel, technical assistance on policies, implementation, and training related to children and youth with special needs in or out of school settings.
Healthcare Sector Endured Job Losses in 2020 as a Result of the COVID Pandemic, but Made Modest Gains in 2021. The healthcare sector lost 527,000 jobs between February 2020 and November 2020, with nursing and residential care accounting for most of the loss, but gained back 77,000 jobs through November 2021, according to HealthleadersMedia.com, “Healthcare Sector Jobs Unchanged in November” (December 3, 2021). According to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics 10-year projections (September 8, 2021), overall, employment is expected to grow 7.7%, with the healthcare and social assistance sector adding the most new jobs (3.3 million). Within healthcare, the individual and family services industry is projected to increase the fastest with an annual growth rate of 3.3%. 
Fewer Nurses are Satisfied with Their Jobs in Wake of COVID. Fewer nurses are satisfied with their occupation in the wake of COVID, according to a study we conducted between May and June 2021 in partnership with Florida Atlantic University's Christine E. Lynn School of Nursing. It found that 32% of surveyed nurses are "very/completely" satisfied with their occupation compared to 52% prior to the pandemic. In addition, 29% of nurses surveyed said their desire to leave the profession is dramatically higher now than before the pandemic. The survey found that 97% of respondents agreed that increasing pay rates and other incentives would attract and retain more nurses.
Macro Drivers of Demand. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) increased the number of insured patients over the past several years, especially in states that expanded Medicaid. In addition, two other long-term macro drivers of our business, a growing and aging U.S. population, should continue to drive demand for our services. The number of Americans ages 65 and older will more than double over the next 40 years and is projected to reach 80 million in 2040. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are 1.3 million residents in nursing homes alone, with nearly another million in assisted living facilities. These numbers are rising, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that 35% of seniors are likely to go into a nursing home later in life. Nursing homes and assisted living facilities are a $450 billion dollar market, expanding annually. However, a 2021 staffing report from the Long Term Care Community Coalition stated that most nursing homes (63%) failed to provide sufficient staffing to meet their residents’ needs.
Healthcare Trends Resulting from the COVID Pandemic. Virtual health will play a growing role in management of chronic conditions, primary care, and the potential for solving some access issues for mental health, according to “Business Group on Health: 2022 Trends to Watch” (November 5, 2021). The future focus will be on achieving optimal quality, appropriateness, experience, and integration of virtual health with in-person delivery. Additionally, on-site clinics are expected to rebound in 2023-2024 to support workforce health, well-being, and safety as part of the post-pandemic future. According to research from Arizton Advisory & Intelligence, "U.S. Telehealth Market - Industry Outlook and Forecast 2021-2026" (May 2021), the U.S. telehealth market was valued at $10 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $43 billion by 2026, growing at an annual rate of 28%.
Supply of Nurses. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook (September 8, 2021), employment of registered nurses is projected to grow 9% from 2020 to 2030, about as fast as the average for all occupations. The RN workforce is expected to grow from 3.1 million in 2020 to 3.4 million in 2030, an increase of 276,800 or 9%. The Bureau also projects the need for an additional 194,500 new RNs each year through 2030, factoring in nurse retirements and workforce exits. According to the Washington State Nurses Association “COVID intensifies the national nursing shortage” (September 15, 2021), it is projected that by 2022, there will be far more registered nurse jobs available than any other profession. With more than 500,000 seasoned RNs anticipated to retire by 2022, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the need for 1.1 million new RNs for expansion and replacement of retirees. Nurse 
shortages are a long-standing issue, but because of COVID, it is anticipated to grow even more by next year. Another factor influencing demand is the shortage of instructors. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, more than 80,000 qualified applicants to bachelor and graduate nursing programs have been turned away due to factors such as insufficient faculty, clinical sites, or classroom space, and clinical preceptors, as well as budget constraints. We believe these shortages should have a positive effect on demand for our services as temporary nurse staffing orders typically increase when nurse vacancy rates rise. 
Physician Shortage. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) “The Complexities of Physician Supply and Demand: Projections From 2019 to 2034” (June 2021), the United States is expected to face a shortage of physicians. The projections show a shortage ranging between 37,800 and 124,000 by 2034 as demand for physicians continues to outpace supply, according to AAMC, including shortfalls in both primary and specialty care. In addition, more than 40% of active physicians in the U.S. will be age 65 or over within the next decade. The issue of increasing clinician burnout, intensified by the pandemic, could cause doctors to cut back their hours or accelerate their plans for retirement.
Competition
As one of the largest providers of workforce solutions and healthcare staffing in the U.S., we operate on a national, regional, and local basis in a highly competitive industry for both healthcare customers and healthcare professionals. In general, we compete against other national companies, as well as numerous smaller, regional, and local companies.
The principal competitive factors in attracting, retaining, and expanding business with healthcare customers nationally include: (i) understanding the customer’s work environment; (ii) offering a comprehensive suite of services to assist the customer in assessing its personnel needs and partnering with customers to design various customizable alternative solutions; (iii) the timely filling of customers' needs; (iv) price; (v) customer service; (vi) quality assurance and screening capabilities; (vii) risk management policies; (viii) insurance coverage; and (ix) general industry reputation.
Through our breadth and expertise of value-added workforce solutions, we have the ability to meet a national shift towards a more integrated delivery of healthcare which allows us to assist hospitals and health systems turning to lower-cost, more accessible alternatives, such as outpatient or ambulatory care centers. By offering travel, per diem, and permanent placement of a variety of healthcare professionals, we are able to present many different types of personnel to hospitals and health systems at their main campuses and their ambulatory and outpatient facilities.
The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified healthcare professionals for temporary employment include: (i) a large national pool of desirable assignments; (ii) pay and benefits; (iii) speed of placements; (iv) customer service; (v) quality of accommodations; and (vi) overall industry reputation. We focus on retaining healthcare professionals by providing high-quality customer service, long-term benefits (to employees), and medical malpractice insurance.
From a candidate attraction standpoint, we have an extensive customer base with hospitals and healthcare facilities, and other healthcare providers, throughout the U.S. As a result, we have a diverse portfolio of assignments for our healthcare professionals to choose from. Healthcare professionals apply with us through our differentiated nursing, locum tenens, and allied healthcare recruitment brands. We believe our access to such a large and diverse group of healthcare professionals makes us more attractive to healthcare institutions and facilities seeking healthcare staffing and workforce solutions in the current dynamic marketplace. Our applicant tracking system for our travel nurse and allied business provides a world-class candidate experience.
Staffing Industry Analysts recognized us as the seventh-largest healthcare staffing firm in the U.S., with 4% market share in 2020. We rank as the fourth-largest travel nurse staffing firm, the third-largest per diem nurse staffing firm, the eighth-largest allied healthcare staffing firm, and the tenth-largest locum tenens firm. Some of our traditional competitors in the workforce solutions, healthcare staffing, and search businesses include: AMN Healthcare Services, CHG Healthcare Services, Jackson Healthcare, Aya Healthcare, RightSourcing, Ingenovis Health, and Medical Solutions. In recent years, several technology-enabled companies have entered the market, though at present we believe the current scale is limited.
Seasonality
The number of healthcare professionals on assignment with us is subject to seasonal fluctuations which may impact our quarterly revenue and earnings. Hospital patient census and staffing needs of our hospital and healthcare facilities fluctuate, which impact our number of orders for a particular period. Many of our hospital and healthcare facility clients 
are located in areas that experience seasonal fluctuations in population during the winter and summer months. These facilities adjust their staffing levels to accommodate the change in this seasonal demand and many of these facilities utilize temporary healthcare professionals to satisfy these seasonal staffing needs. Likewise, the number of nurse and allied professionals on assignment may fluctuate due to the seasonal preferences for destinations of our temporary nurse and allied professionals. In addition, we expect our Physician Staffing business to experience higher demand in the summer months as physicians take vacations, while our education and school business are expected to experience lower demand in the summer months when public and charter schools are closed. This historical seasonality of revenue and earnings may vary due to a variety of factors and the results of any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.
Certifications
The staffing businesses of our brands are certified by The Joint Commission under its Health Care Staffing Services Certification Program. The Joint Commission is the recognized global leader for health care accreditation. Certification promotes a culture of excellence across the organization, and is recognized nationwide as a symbol of quality that reflects an organization's commitment to meeting certain performance standards. In addition, Credent Verification and Licensing Services, a subsidiary of Medical Doctor Associates, is certified by the NCQA.
Regulations
Our business is subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate throughout the U.S. Complex federal and state laws and regulations govern, among other things, the licensure of professionals, the payment of our employees (e.g., wage and hour laws, employment taxes, and income tax withholdings, etc.), and the general operations of our business, which may be amended from time to time. Future federal and state legislation or interpretations thereof may require us to change our business practices. Compliance with all of these applicable rules and regulations require a significant amount of resources. We endeavor to be in compliance with all such rules and regulations.

Our ability to be successful in our marketplace directly depends on attracting and retaining talented and skilled employees, and keeping those individuals fully engaged in our business.

Talent Development. Our mission regarding talent management and development is to support organizational results and success by employing strategies to attract, engage, develop, and retain employees, and to partner with our leaders to nurture and grow leadership talent. These investments include providing clear insight into employee performance, creating career paths, promoting from within whenever possible, maintaining open communication, and offering professional development opportunities. In 2020, we adopted Dayforce, a human resources tool which features a fully interactive learning management system, where employees can access professional development resources such as skills training courses. We partnered with Strayer University and Capella University to provide our employees with access to flexible degree programs at a discounted cost. We have also embraced the Nursing Now pledge by reinforcing investment in the workforce, continuing to promote nurses to management roles, and providing guidance and support on best nursing practices through our dedicated clinical team. Nurse Now is a global campaign aimed at improving health by raising the status and profile of nursing.
Community and Social Impact. We participate in numerous events with a variety of non-profit organizations. Our mission to deliver quality patient care extends to our community and we are committed to action that fosters positive impact in our community and around the U.S. Our human resources department develops and implements programs to help our employees realize their potential through volunteering and supporting our communities. Employees are able to take paid time off to perform volunteer activities, and are able to donate to a charity of their choice directly from their paychecks, either as a one-time donation or ongoing. We have also launched an employee-led council which encourages employees from a wide variety of backgrounds and of diversity to come together, connect, build relationships, and have their voices heard.
We have a long-standing commitment to our employees to create a business working environment that fosters engagement through personal innovation, achievement, wellness, advancement and training/development opportunities, promoting health and safety, and investments in their communities. These efforts culminate in creating a business culture of achievement and loyalty that enables us to minimize turnover in our workforce and succeed in competitive and challenging marketplaces.
