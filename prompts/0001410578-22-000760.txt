Item 1.Business
General
Servotronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Registrant” or the “Company”) design, manufacture and market advanced technology products consisting primarily of control components and consumer products consisting of knives and various types of cutlery and other edged products. The Company operates through two primary segments: the Advanced Technology Group (ATG) and the Consumer Products Group (CPG).
The Company was incorporated in New York in 1959. In 1972, the Company was merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, thereby changing the Company’s state of incorporation from New York to Delaware.
The Company’s shares currently trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE American) under the symbol SVT.
Products
Advanced Technology Products (ATG)
The Company designs, manufactures and markets a variety of servo-control components which convert an electrical current into a mechanical force or movement and other related products. The principal servo-control components produced include torque motors, electromagnetic actuators, hydraulic valves, pneumatic valves and similar devices, all of which perform the same general function. These are sold principally to the commercial aerospace, aircraft and government related industries, as well as medical and industrial markets.

To fill most of its orders for components, the Company must either modify a standard model or design a new product in order to satisfy the customer’s particular requirements. The Company also produces unique products based on specifications provided by its customers. The Company produces under long-term contracts and other types of orders.
The Company may from time to time produce metallic seals of various cross-sectional configurations. These seals fit between two surfaces, usually metal, to produce a more secure and leak-proof joint. The Company manufactures these seals to close tolerances from standard and special alloy steels. Ductile coatings are often applied to the seals in order to increase their effectiveness.
The Company has also produced other products of its own and/or of a given design to meet customers’ requirements.
Consumer Products (CPG)
The Company designs, manufactures and sells a variety of edged products, tools and specialty consumer products for domestic and international distribution. These products include a wide range of cutlery items such as steak, carving, bread, butcher and paring knives for household use and for use in restaurants, institutions and private industry, as well as equipment and gear including fixed and folding knives for hunting, fishing and camping. The Company also sells knives and tools to the U.S. Government, related agencies, and allied foreign governments. These products include machetes, bayonets, axes, strap cutters, and other tools that are designed primarily for military and rescue/first-responder use, but are viable in commercial markets as well. The Company also produces and markets other edged products such as various specialty tools, putty knives, linoleum sheet cutters, field knives and medical items including scalpels and micro-spatulas. The Company manufactures its products from stainless and high carbon steels, titanium, or synthetic materials in numerous styles, designs, models and sizes. Substantially all of the Company’s commercial related products are intended for the moderate to premium priced markets. The Company also provides plastic fabrication, metal fabrication and other engineering, design, and OEM/white-label manufacturing services to regional customers. This includes the production of a wide range of machined, engineered, and/or molded consumer and industrial products and components.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Advanced Technology Products
The Company’s ATG products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Products are primarily non-seasonal in nature. These products are sold to commercial aviation manufacturers, government prime contractors, government subcontractors, and end-users. Sales are made primarily by the Company’s professional staff.
The Company’s prime contracts and subcontracts with United States Government subcontractors and commercial manufacturers are subject to termination at the convenience of the customer. In the event of such termination, the Company is ordinarily entitled to receive payment for its costs and profits on work done prior to termination. Since the inception of the Company’s business, less than 1% of its contracts have been terminated for convenience. The Company’s sales of advanced technology products are composed primarily of a small group of customers. The Company has a significant concentration of business with two major customers: Customer A and Customer B. Sales to Customer A accounted for 33.5% of consolidated sales in 2021 and 26.7% of consolidated sales in 2020. Sales to Customer B accounted for 19.1% of consolidated sales in 2021 and 22.3% of consolidated sales in 2020. In 2021 and 2020 we had a concentration of sales to Customer A and Customer B representing approximately 52.6% and 49.0% of our consolidated sales, respectively.
Two commercial aircraft accidents in 2018 and 2019 led to the grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. A significant portion of the units shipped to Customer B support Boeing 737 MAX aircraft production as shown in the table below:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-----+---+------------------------------+---+---------------+--
​ | | 737 MAX shipments as a % of: | 
Year | ​ | Customer B shipments | ​ | ATG Shipments | 
2019 | | 27 | % | 13 | %
2020 | | 17 | % | 6 | %
2021 | | 16 | % | 4 | %

There was a significant decline of 30.0% in shipments to Customer B for the Boeing 737 MAX and a 38% decline in total shipments to Customer B in 2020 as compared to 2019. There was an additional decline of 42% in shipments to Customer B for the Boeing 737 MAX and a 38% decline in total shipments to Customer B in 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020.
The ATG revenue decreased approximately $9,105,000 in 2021 as compared to 2020. Customer A revenue increased approximately $258,000 or less than 2% in 2021 as compared to 2020. Customer B revenue decreased approximately $3,334,000 or (30)% in 2021 as compared to 2020. Customer B revenue drop was 37% of total ATG drop in revenue in 2021 as compared to 2020.
The loss of either of these customers would have a significant impact on our revenue and earnings. The reduction in business with Customer B has significantly reduced our sales and earnings. See Note 1, Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Concentration of Credit Risks, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information related to sales concentrations.
Consumer Products
The Company’s consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Consumer sales are seasonal. Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores. The Company’s Consumer Products Group (CPG) also sells its knives and tools (principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives) to various branches of the United States Government. Additionally, the Company provides OEM and white label product design and manufacturing services to a regional customer base across a wide range of consumer and commercial industries. No single customer of the CPG represented more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2021 or 2020. The Company sells its products and manufacturing services through its own sales resources, independent manufacturers’ representatives and electronic commerce.
Business Segments
Business segment information is presented in Note 10, Business Segments, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Intellectual Properties
The Company has rights under certain copyrights, trademarks, patents, and registered domain names. In the view of management, the Company’s competitive position is not dependent on patent protection.
Research Activities
The amount spent by the Company in research and development activities during its 2021 and 2020 fiscal years was not significant, but the Company does take advantage of tax credits for research and development activities when available. Such activities are expensed as incurred.
Environmental Compliance
The cost of compliance with current environmental laws has not been material and the Company does not anticipate that it will be in the future. The Company does not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Company’s business, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position.
Manufacturing
The Company manufactures its ATG products in Elma, New York and Franklinville, New York and its CPG products in Franklinville, New York.

Raw Materials and Other Supplies
The Company purchases raw materials and certain components for its products from outside vendors. The Company is generally not dependent upon a single source of supply for any raw material or component used in its operations. We believe the loss of any one supplier, although potentially disruptive in the short-term, would not materially affect our operations in the long-term. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic and supply chain disruptions, the Company continues to face upward pricing pressure on certain parts and raw materials.
Competition
Although no reliable industry statistics are available to enable the Company to determine accurately its relative competitive position with respect to any of its products, the Company believes that it is a significant factor with respect to certain of its servo-control components within its competitive market. The Company’s share of the overall cutlery market is not significant.
The Company has many different competitors with respect to servo-control components because of the nature of that business and the fact that these products also face competition from other types of control components which, at times, can accomplish the desired result. Many of these competitors are substantially larger and have greater resources than the Company.
The Company encounters active competition with respect to its consumer products from numerous companies, many of which are larger in terms of manufacturing capacity, financial resources and marketing organization. Its principal competitors vary depending upon the customer and/or the products involved. The Company believes that it competes primarily with more than 20 companies with respect to its consumer products, in addition to foreign imports. To the Company’s knowledge, its principal competitors with regard to cutlery include Corelle Brands Holdings, Inc., Benchmade Knife Company, Inc., Tramontina, Inc., Dexter-Russell Inc., W. R. Case & Sons Cutlery Company, Lifetime Brands, Inc., Cutco Corporation and Gerber. The Company also competes with other regional manufacturing companies for its molded plastic and metal and plastic fabrication services. To the Company’s knowledge, its principal competitors with regard to manufacturing services include PM Plastics, Monarch Plastics and Ontario Plastics.
The Company markets most of its products throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in select foreign markets. The Company believes that it competes in marketing its servo-control products primarily on the basis of operating performance, adherence to rigid specifications, quality, price and delivery and its consumer products primarily on the basis of price, quality and delivery.
