ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
The Meet Group, Inc. (the “Company,” “The Meet Group,” “us,” or “we”) is a portfolio of mobile social entertainment apps designed to meet the universal need for human connection.  We leverage a powerful live-streaming video platform, empowering our global community to forge meaningful connections. Our primary apps are MeetMe®, LOVOO®, Skout®, Tagged® and, as of March 5, 2019, Growlr®.
We operate location-based social networks for meeting new people, primarily on mobile platforms, including on iPhone, Android, iPad and other tablets, that facilitate interactions among users and encourage users to connect, communicate and engage with each other. Over the past two years we have transformed our business from an advertising based revenue model to one where the majority of our revenue is derived from user pay monetization and subscription. The fastest growing component of user pay monetization comes from in-app purchases, including virtual gifts associated with our live video product.
We began developing our video platform in 2016 with the belief that we could successfully pair live-streaming and dating – a model that we had seen work effectively for Asian dating app providers. We first launched video on MeetMe early in 2017, and, in October of 2017, we began to monetize the feature by enabling gifting within the video streams. During this time period, we also executed on our strategy of acquiring other properties: Skout, Inc. (“Skout”), Ifwe Inc. (“if(we)”) and Lovoo GmbH (“Lovoo”) – where we believed our live-streaming platform would fit naturally. We then integrated live video into each app. We launched the monetized video platform on Skout in the fourth quarter of 2017, Tagged (if(we)) in the second quarter of 2018 and Lovoo beginning in the second quarter of 2018. We have also continued to add features and enhancements intended to drive video engagement and increase monetization for all the apps. Live video has become the fastest growing revenue product in our history.
We also offer online marketing capabilities, which enable marketers to display their advertisements on our apps. We offer significant scale to our advertising partners, with hundreds of millions of daily impressions across our active global user base, and sophisticated data science for effective targeting. We work with our advertisers and advertising networks to maximize the effectiveness of their campaigns by optimizing advertisement formats and placements.
Just as Facebook has established itself as the social network of friends and family, and LinkedIn as the social network of colleagues and business professionals, The Meet Group is creating the social entertainment network not of the people you know, but of the people you want to know. Nimble, fast-moving and already in more than 100 countries, we are challenging the dominant player in our space, Match Group, Inc. (“Match Group”), and differentiating ourselves with live video, which is not offered by many of our direct competitors. Modeled after the video products offered by Asian dating app providers, but enhanced in order to appeal to western audiences, our live video product is aimed at the nexus of entertainment and community, where we believe our apps exhibit natural strength.
Our vision extends beyond dating and entertainment. We focus on building quality products to satisfy the universal need for human connection among all people, everywhere – not just paying subscribers. We believe meeting new people is a basic human need, especially for users aged 18-34, when so many long-lasting relationships are made. We use advanced technology to engineer serendipitous connections among people who otherwise might never have met – a sort of digital coffeehouse where everyone belongs. Over the years, The Meet Group’s apps have originated untold numbers of chats, shares, good friendships, dates, romantic relationships – even marriages.
We believe that we have significant growth opportunities enabled through our social entertainment platform. We believe our scale provides unique advantages to grow video monetization, while also establishing a high density of users within the geographic regions we serve. As The Meet Group’s networks grow and the number of users in a location increases, we believe that users who are seeking to meet new people will incrementally benefit from the quantity of relevant connections.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
How We Create Value for Users
We provide something we feel everyone craves: the magic of human connection. Through our live-streaming video platform and pipeline of new products, such as live video gifting, we are helping to connect a portion of the over 50 million people aged 18-34 in the U.S. and the more than one billion worldwide. We offer a range of free and subscription-based services to our users, monetizing through direct user purchases including video, subscription, in-app purchase revenue as well as through advertising. In 2018, we generated approximately 60% of our revenue from user pay sources.
Monetization of our video product is done primarily through gifting. In our one-to-many live-streaming feature, a single broadcaster can entertain and interact with essentially unlimited viewers on the app. Gifting enables those viewers to use virtual credits purchased through iTunes or Google Play to send the broadcaster a virtual gift as a show of appreciation or interest for that entertainment.
People use The Meet Group apps to make friends, socialize, date, be entertained and chat. In fact, in our internal survey of MeetMe users conducted in January 2019, 83% of those responding said they preferred to start relationships as friends. We believe this comfort level drives higher engagement and retention.
We believe we are well positioned to continue to grow user engagement and generate revenue with our live-streaming video platform and continued execution against an aggressive product pipeline. We believe new video products not only have the potential to attract new users, but also to grow monetization per user.
More than four million people use our apps, on average, every day to meet new people in their local communities and throughout the world. In many cases they are logging in multiple times per day in order to interact with other users and engage in live video broadcasts. More than 20% of our mobile users engage with our video product each day, and we are seeing increasing video monetization across our apps. Not only are users being entertained, but many are also meeting friends, significant others and potential spouses every day.
Our applications offer a variety of ways for users to discover and interact with one another, with Live increasingly becoming a core medium of connection.
The most popular feature has traditionally been one-on-one chat, and users spend much of their time with The Meet Group interacting with the connections they have made on our apps. Our primary “magic” is not chat itself, but the ease with which our users can find new people with whom to chat. Our chat service is generally provided free to all users. Lovoo limits the number of chats a user can send for free and provides for the ability to unlock additional chats with a paid subscription or in-app purchase.
There are four key features we offer to facilitate connections between users, “Browse,” “Swipe,” “Feed” and “Live.”
The most direct is a “Browse” feature, which allows users to peruse profiles and photos of potential connections nearby or around the world. We use sophisticated, data-backed algorithms to prioritize the most relevant recommendations for each user, optimizing for real connection as measured by each one’s likelihood to reply and engage in a lengthy conversation.
For users interested in a quicker, more gamified experience, each of our apps offers a “Swipe” feature, which allows users to, in effect, swipe left and right on potential matches based on their photos and limited profile information. When two users express interest in one another in the swipe, we notify each one of the match and encourage them to chat. We believe double-sided match requirement causes these conversations to be significantly more efficient, but somewhat less frequent, than those that come from a Browse feature.
We also enable users, on apps other than Lovoo, to discover and connect with one another around content, including both text and photo posts, within our “Feed” features. In this model, rather than browsing profiles, users are browsing content created by other users, either nearby or around the world. This content offers a compelling jumping-off point for extended conversation, both public (in the form of comments on that content) and private (in the form of one-on-one chats that subsequently develop).
In 2017, we began an aggressive push into live video, adding a new section called “Live,” which we believe to be both an engaging and highly monetizable format for communication and social entertainment, on our MeetMe and Skout applications. We added similar functionality to our Tagged and Lovoo applications in 2018. We also added new features within Live, most recently with the launch of “Battles” on MeetMe and Skout in December 2018.

The one-to-many broadcasting feature of Live enables our users to become performers, gain an audience, cultivate relationships with their top fans, and earn cash rewards if they produce engaging content and spend enough time on our platforms. The most popular livestreamers interact directly with their live audience on our apps, even allowing audience members to join their streams as guest streamers. Audience members can make in-app purchases to show their appreciation with gifts to livestreamers.
Users can also make in-app purchases in other features within the apps, typically either to unlock content or functionality or to prioritize their profiles or content within the applications. For example, users can spend Credits, Points or Gold for promotion within the Browse and Feed features, which garners them more attention with the goal of allowing them to find more connections more quickly. As another example, users may purchase the ability to unlock the list of who viewed their profile or who expressed interest.
Finally, each of our apps also offers a subscription service for those users who want to have the very best experience and the most options available to them. Benefits for subscribers vary across the portfolio, but include additional advanced filters, suppression of advertisements, permanent access to information or features otherwise locked, and increased or eliminated limits on functionality such as daily icebreakers or swipe gameplay.
Our Strategy
We are executing on our core mission of meeting the universal need for human connection with a focus on live video products, while diversifying our revenue base towards user pay revenue such as subscriptions and in-app purchases as we scale our business and strive to grow revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.
Our strategy for 2019 and beyond is aimed at growing our audience, expanding our video offerings and engaging our active user base to drive monetization. 
Key elements of our strategy include:
Strengthen the Core:  Having transformed our business to a primarily user pay model, a key area of our focus is to strengthen the core social entertainment business we have built. This includes developing and delivering new video products, as we did with the launch of Battles in late 2018, enhancing the user experience, and improving operational execution across our business. We believe that by strengthening our core business we will improve user monetization and grow revenue.
Expand into Adjacencies:  Beyond our current user base, we see opportunities to leverage our social entertainment platform to expand into new user groups, adjacencies and niches, both organically or inorganically. Having acquired and integrated three businesses in the 2016-2018 time frame, and having successfully brought live video to each of the new acquisitions, we expect to enter new markets, including, for example, the gay community and additional geographies, to build scale and create value. On March 5, 2019, we acquired Initech, LLC, a privately held company that owns and operates a leading same-sex social application, Growlr (“Growlr”). We acquired Growlr for $11.8 million, using $4.8 million in cash on hand and $7.0 million from our existing revolving credit facility, plus an earnout of $2.0 million to be paid in annual $1.0 million installments over the next two years if certain revenue metrics are achieved in each year.
Additional opportunities include the development and delivery of standalone apps with a non-dating focus as well as geographic expansion. 
Grow Margins:  We will continue to focus on improving operating efficiencies and margins, while investing in growth from new products.

Operating Metrics
We measure website and mobile application activity in terms of monthly active users (“MAUs”) and daily active users (“DAUs”). We define a MAU as a registered user of one of our platforms who has logged in and visited within the last month of measurement.

Trends in Our Metrics
In addition to MAUs and DAUs, we measure activity on the Company’s apps in terms of average revenue per user (“ARPU”) and average daily revenue per daily active user (“ARPDAU”). We define ARPU as the quarterly revenue per average MAU. We define ARPDAU as the average daily revenue per DAU. We define mobile MAU as a user who accessed our sites by one of our mobile applications or by the mobile optimized version of our websites for MeetMe, Skout and Lovoo, whether on a mobile phone or tablet during the month of measurement. We define a mobile DAU as a user who accessed our sites by one of our mobile applications or by the mobile optimized version of our websites for MeetMe, Skout and Lovoo, whether on a mobile phone or tablet during the day of measurement.
In the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the Company averaged 15.18 million mobile MAUs and 17.58 million total MAUs, as compared to 13.99 million mobile MAUs and 16.70 million total MAUs on average in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, a net increase of 1.19 million or 9% for mobile MAUs, and a net increase of 0.88 million or 5% for total MAUs. Mobile DAUs averaged 4.27 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 and 4.29 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the Company averaged 4.86 million total DAUs, as compared to 4.95 million total DAUs on average for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, a net decrease of approximately 0.09 million total DAUs, or 2%.

As the business continues to evolve and as subscription and in-app purchases contribute to a larger portion of revenue, we may choose to report new or additional metrics that are more closely tied to key business drivers or stop reporting metrics that are no longer relevant. 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
We are continually developing new products, as well as optimizing our existing platforms and feature sets in order to meet the evolving needs of our user base and advertising partners.
We develop most of our software internally. We will, however, purchase technology and license intellectual property rights where it is strategically important, operationally compatible, or economically advantageous. For instance, we partner with third parties for video and to further our internationalization efforts as we look to bring additional languages into our existing platforms. We are not materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to product development. We work with third party payment providers as part of our video monetization product.
Our technology team of 170 people consists of our product development and engineering team, our database administration team, our quality assurance team and our network system operators. These teams are responsible for feature enhancements and general maintenance across all of our platforms. Our technology team is headquartered in New Hope, Pennsylvania with additional offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, San Francisco, California and Dresden, Germany.
SALES AND MARKETING
We have grown our user base through organic, viral channels as well as through acquisitions. By encouraging members to invite their friends to join our apps and to share their activity across other external platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, and by

providing members with easy-to-use tools, we believe we have successfully grown our user base while minimizing marketing costs. We focus primarily on creating a truly differentiated experience and compelling value proposition for new users in our markets and developing the technologies needed to facilitate their word-of-mouth marketing on our behalf in order to attract and retain new members.
Our paid customer acquisition strategy will focus on acquiring users in geographies where we believe we will see payback on our acquisition investment. We spent $25.6 million, $15.8 million and $12.1 million on paid direct user acquisition in 2018, 2017 and 2016, or 14.3%, 12.8% and 15.9% of our total revenue, respectively.  
SALES AND OPERATIONS
Our advertising sales and operations team is comprised of 11 full-time employees in the U.S. and Germany and covers major brand agencies, direct response and cost-per-action engagement advertisers, advertising networks, and mobile agencies. Our advertising operations are headquartered in New Hope, Pennsylvania, with additional offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, San Francisco, California and Dresden and Berlin, Germany.
Our operations and member services team consists of 40 full-time employees, 2 part-time employees, and approximately 200 contractors split between Delhi and Bangalore, India. This team is responsible for reviewing images and other user-generated content, investigating and responding to member abuse reports, and providing general customer support.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our intellectual property includes trademarks related to our brands, products, and services, copyrights in software and creative content, patents, trade secrets, domain names, and other intellectual property rights and licenses of various kinds. We seek to protect our intellectual property through trademark and other laws of the U.S. and other countries, and through contractual provisions.
We consider the MeetMe, Skout, Tagged, Hi5, Lovoo, Growlr and Social Theater trademarks and our related trademarks to be valuable to the Company, and we have registered these trademarks in the U.S. and other countries throughout the world and aggressively seek to protect them.
COMPETITION
We believe we are challenging the dominant player in the dating space, Match Group, but we are not limited to dating. We operate at the forefront of nascent segments (social discovery and social entertainment) of a broader sector that is still being defined (social networking). As such, we face significant competition in every aspect of our business, both from established companies whose products help users meet new people, or are evolving to do so, and from smaller but well-funded startups that can quickly gain attention and compete with us for users. Examples of services that compete with us for users and advertiser interest include, but are not limited to:

• | Mobile applications and websites whose primary focus is to help users meet new people in their geographical area, including Badoo, Twoo and Meetup.


• | Social networking mobile applications and websites with a focus on dating, which is a subset of the opportunity around meeting new people, such as Zoosk, Match, Happn, PlentyOfFish, OkCupid and Tinder.


• | Other video platforms that provide one-to-many and one-to-one video services such as live.me, Tiktoc, Azar, Younow, Bigo, Twitch and Periscope.


• | Broader social networks that currently offer or may evolve to offer services aimed at helping users meet new people in their area, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.


• | Significant competition for Social Theater comes from publishers including TrueX, Unruly Media, Ironsource, Jun Group and Genesis Media.

As we introduce new products, and as other companies introduce new products and services, we expect to become subject to additional competition. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our competition is included in Part I, Item 1A—Risk Factors of this report.
In addition to other online dating and social networking brands, we compete indirectly with offline dating services, such as matchmakers.

EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 296 full-time and 12 part-time employees in the U.S. and Germany. Our future success is substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management and key technical personnel, as well as our continuing ability to attract, maintain the caliber of, and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our employees is included in Part I, Item 1A—Risk Factors of this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
In the U.S., advertising and promotional information presented to visitors on our mobile applications and websites and our other marketing activities are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices. There are a variety of state and federal restrictions on the marketing activities conducted by email, or over the Internet, including U.S. federal and state privacy laws and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or the TCPA, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2001, or the CAN-SPAM Act. We may also be subject to laws in the various other countries in which we operate, including the General Data Protection Regulation which came into effect in most of Europe on May 25, 2018. The rules and regulations are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by courts or other governmental authorities. We may unintentionally violate such laws, such laws may be modified, and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments (or developments stemming from enactment or modification of other laws) or the failure to anticipate accurately the application or interpretation of these laws could create liability to us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our businesses. Additional information regarding certain risks related to government regulations is included in Part I, Item 1A—Risk Factors of this report.
