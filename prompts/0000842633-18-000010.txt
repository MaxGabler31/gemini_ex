Each of our businesses provides products through established distribution channels that cater to the specific needs of our customers’ purchasing behaviors. We developed many of these channels over decades, and believe they are a competitive differentiator for us across the markets we serve. In many cases, we provide products to end markets through our captive branch and warehouse distribution locations, while in other cases we supply to large and small distribution companies that provide our customers with flexible purchasing solutions. For example, Rieke accesses its markets through direct sales to end-use customers, as well as through leading distributors, where it has enjoyed favorable, long-standing relationships. TriMas Aerospace provides fasteners directly to OEM customers and through well-established aerospace distribution partners. Norris Cylinder markets its steel cylinders both directly to packaged gas companies, as well as to distributors and resellers. Our Lamons business operates with a primary manufacturing facility in Texas and sales branches strategically located near petrochemical and refining complexes, allowing Lamons to offer a high level of service to its customer base. Enabled by its branch network and close proximity to its customers, we believe Lamons’ ability to deliver quick turn-around and customized solutions for its customers provides a competitive advantage.


• | TriMas Business Model. We believe the diverse nature of the businesses we own and industries we serve, coupled with our light capital investment model, provide significant cash conversion opportunities. We implemented the TriMas Business Model ("TBM") in late 2016 to improve the management of our businesses, The TBM provides a platform to set near- and long-term performance objectives and goals, including safety, financial, and talent development, measure these against defined objectives, and utilize a reliable communication and escalation process that provides for flexibility and adjustments if market expectations change. We believe the TBM connects our operations, and allows us to benefit from sharing best practices across each of our businesses. The TBM has helped to drive improvement in our performance. For example, since August 2016, we have rationalized 13 manufacturing, warehousing and office locations, streamlined fixed expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses in certain of our businesses experiencing softer end markets, and increased our focus on optimizing inventory levels. We believe actions driven by the TBM have provided an economic benefit to us and have augmented our cash conversion characteristics and performance overall. Specifically, we reduced our debt from $374.7 million at December 31, 2016 to $303.1 million at December 31, 2017. We will continue to rely on the TBM to drive continuous improvement and employee motivation to better manage our operations and to unlock TriMas’ value potential.

Our Strategies 
Guided by our experienced management team and our commitment to operational excellence, we have pursued, and continue to advance, the following strategies:

• | Relentless Commitment to Cash Conversion. Our operating and financial model, combined with management’s disciplined approach to capital allocation and other investments, are strategic imperatives that we will continue to execute. Through focused management, we believe we have the ability to generate substantial free cash flow for reinvestment in our businesses consistent with our capital allocation priorities. We will manage indebtedness consistent with our long-term net leverage target and invest in organic growth in our most compelling market segments. We also expect to consider strategic bolt-on acquisitions that would fit within our current product areas, as well as other capital actions consistent with our long-term, financial principles.


• | Accelerate Growth and Achieve Market Leading Returns. We use the TBM to drive management’s decision-making processes to achieve our annual growth targets, as well as drive our businesses towards achieving market-leading returns. We believe our commitment to having well-defined strategies in place, setting and executing against annual goals and long-range targets, and operating in a data-driven environment will help us optimize our performance.

• | Entry into New Markets and Development of New Customers. Engineered Components has opportunities to grow its businesses by offering its products to new customers, markets and geographies. Norris Cylinder is the only manufacturer of high and low-pressure steel cylinders in North America. Norris Cylinder is selling its cylinders internationally primarily into Europe, South and Central America, and the Asia Pacific region as well as pursuing new end markets such as cylinders for use as hydrogen fuel cells in storage (cell towers) and transport (fork trucks), in breathing air applications and in fire suppression. Arrow Engine continues to expand its product portfolio to serve new customers and new applications for oil and natural gas production in all areas of the industry, including shale drilling. Although tempered by lower drilling levels over the past few years, Arrow Engine has also been focused on expanding its international sales, particularly in Mexico, Indonesia and Venezuela.


• | Manage Capacity to Reflect Expected Demand Levels. Norris Cylinder has deployed previously acquired assets in both its Huntsville, Alabama and Longview, Texas facilities to mitigate risk, improve efficiency and support its future expected growth, increasing its manufacturing flexibility for both large and small high pressure cylinders. Norris Cylinder is in process of installing equipment to produce higher volume cylinders more efficiently, which will allow higher technology products to be produced on the existing forge asset. Norris Cylinder also flexes its operating cost structure in coordination with movements in demand. Arrow Engine has been unfavorably impacted by reductions in drilling activity driven by the decline in oil prices. In response, we re-aligned Arrow Engine's business to reflect the current demand levels by lowering costs and maximizing resources until the end market recovers, including closing or consolidating four of its former locations. We have also variablized Arrow Engine's cost structure to respond quickly to end market changes and enhance flexibility, driving low cost sourcing efforts, and focusing on additional productivity and Lean initiatives.

Marketing, Customers and Distribution 
Customers of our Engineered Components businesses operate in the oil, gas, industrial and commercial end markets. Given the focused nature of many of our products, we rely upon a combination of a direct sales force and an established network of independent distributors with familiarity of the end-users. In many of the markets this segment serves, its companies’ brand names are virtually synonymous with product applications. The narrow end-user base of many of these products makes it possible for this segment to respond to customer-specific engineered applications and provide a high degree of customer service. Our OEM and aftermarket customers include Airgas/Air Liquide, Chesapeake, Kidde-Fenwal, Natural Gas Compression Systems, Praxair and Total Operations and Production Services ("TOPS"). In years with higher levels of drilling activity, DNOW and Weatherford were larger customers of engines, parts and compressor products. 
Engineering Components manufacturing facilities are located are in the United States. 
Competition 
Norris Cylinder competes against Worthington, Beijing Tianhai Industry Co., Faber and Vitkovice Cylinders. In May 2012, the U.S. International Trade Commission made a unanimous final determination that Norris Cylinder had been materially injured by imports of DOT high pressure steel cylinders that were being subsidized by the Government of China, as well as being dumped in the U.S. market by producers in China. As a result, antidumping and countervailing duties were imposed on the subject imports for a five year period to create a fairer competitive environment in the United States. The duties were extended for an additional five year period during 2017, and will be subject to renewal in 2022. Arrow Engine tends to compete against natural gas powered, lower horsepower, multi-cylinder engines from manufacturers such as Caterpillar, Chevy, Cummins and Ford industrial engines and electric motors. In general, Norris Cylinder and Arrow Engine supply highly engineered, non-commodity, customer-specific products with large shares of small markets supplied by a limited number of competitors.

TriMas' Acquisition Strategy
We believe that TriMas has significant opportunities to grow through disciplined, strategic acquisitions that enhance the strengths of our core businesses. We typically seek "bolt-on" acquisitions, in which we acquire another industry participant or adjacent product lines that expand our existing product offerings, gain access to new customers, end markets and distribution channels, expand our geographic footprint and/or capitalize on scale and cost efficiencies. Strategically, our primary focus is on bolt-on acquisition candidates in the Packaging segment, as this segment has a higher growth and margin profile. While we would also consider opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions in our other segments, such transactions are of secondary focus.
Materials and Supply Arrangements
Our largest raw material purchases are for steel, polyethylene and other resins, aluminum, titanium and copper. Raw materials and other supplies used in our operations are normally available from a variety of competing suppliers. In addition to raw materials, we purchase a variety of components and finished products from low-cost sources in China, India, Mexico, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.
Steel is purchased primarily from steel mills and service centers with pricing contracts principally in the three-to-six month time frame. Changing global dynamics for steel production and supply will continue to present a challenge to our business. Polyethylene is generally a commodity resin with multiple suppliers capable of providing product globally. 
Historically, we have experienced volatility in costs of our raw material purchases, and have worked with our suppliers to manage costs and disruptions in supply. We also utilize pricing programs to pass increased steel, resin and other raw material costs to customers. Although we may experience delays in our ability to implement price increases, we have been generally able to recover such increased costs.
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 4,000 people, of which approximately 46% were located outside the United States and 16% were unionized. We currently have collective bargaining agreements covering five facilities worldwide, two of which are in the United States. Two of the three facilities outside the United States with collective bargaining agreements are associated with state-controlled unions. 
We believe employee relations are good and are not aware of any present active union organizing activities at any of our other facilities. We cannot predict the impact of any further unionization of our workplace. Our labor agreement with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America at our TriMas Aerospace facility in Commerce, California expires in August 2018 and we expect to enter into timely negotiations regarding the extension of our agreement. 
Seasonality and Backlog
Our business does not experience significant seasonal fluctuation, other than our fourth quarter, which has tended to be the lowest net sales quarter of the year given holiday shutdowns by certain of our customers and other customers deferring capital spending to the new year. We do not consider sales order backlog to be a material factor in our businesses. Our TriMas Aerospace customers often provide a forward view of build rates and need for products, but firm orders do not extend for more than a few months, and are not guaranteed and subject to change.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges and chemical and hazardous waste management and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners' or operators' releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment and compliance with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. However, the nature of our operations and our long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities.
Current laws and regulations have not had a material impact on our business, capital expenditures or financial position. However, we must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords. Future events, including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas regulation could require us to incur expenses related to the modification or curtailment of operations, installation of pollution control equipment or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites.

Intangible Assets
Our identified intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names and technology, are recorded at approximately $194.2 million at December 31, 2017, net of accumulated amortization. The valuation of each of the identified intangibles was performed using broadly accepted valuation methodologies and techniques.
Customer Relationships. We have developed and maintained stable, long-term selling relationships with customer groups for specific branded products and/or focused market product offerings within each of our businesses. Useful lives assigned to customer relationship intangibles range from five to 25 years and have been estimated using historic customer retention and turnover data. Other factors considered in evaluating estimated useful lives include the diverse nature of focused markets and products of which we have significant share, how customers in these markets make purchases and these customers' position in the supply chain. We also monitor and evaluate the impact of other evolving risks including the threat of lower cost competitors and evolving technology.
Trademarks and Trade Names. Each of our businesses designs and manufactures products for focused markets under various trade names and trademarks (see discussion above by reportable segment). Our trademark/trade name intangibles are well-established and considered long-lived assets that require maintenance through advertising and promotion expenditures. Because it is our practice and intent to maintain and to continue to support, develop and market these trademarks/trade names for the foreseeable future, we consider our rights in these trademarks/trade names to have an indefinite life, except as otherwise dictated by applicable law.
Technology. We hold a number of United States and foreign patents, patent applications, and proprietary product and process-oriented technologies within all four of our reportable segments. We have, and will continue to dedicate, technical resources toward the further development of our products and processes in order to maintain our competitive position in the industrial, commercial and consumer end markets that we serve. Estimated useful lives for our technology intangibles range from one to 30 years and are determined in part by any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit useful life. For example, patent rights have a maximum limit of 20 years in the United States. Other factors considered include the expected use of the technology by the operating groups, the expected useful life of the product and/or product programs to which the technology relates, and the rate of technology adoption by the industry.
International Operations
Approximately 14.0% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were derived from sales by our businesses located outside of the United States, and we may expand our international operations through organic growth actions and acquisitions. In addition, approximately 16.2% of our long-lived assets as of December 31, 2017 were located outside of the United States. We operate manufacturing facilities in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Mexico, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. In addition to the net sales derived from sales by our businesses located outside of the United States, we also generated approximately $79.8 million of export sales from the United States. For information pertaining to the net sales and long-lived assets attributed to our international operations, refer to Note 19, "Segment Information," included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," within this Form 10-K.
