Business
 
Digipath Labs, Inc. - Cannabis Testing
 
Our cannabis testing business is operated through our wholly owned subsidiary, Digipath Labs, Inc., which performs all cannabis related testing using FDA-compliant laboratory equipment and processes. We opened our first testing lab in Las Vegas, Nevada in May of 2015 to serve the new State approved and licensed medical marijuana industry. We have plans to open labs in other legal states, assuming resources permit.
 
We seek to be the nation’s highest standard, full-service testing lab for cannabis and ancillary cannabis infused products. We are a third party independent testing laboratory facility for cannabis, cannabis infused products and other botanical nutraceuticals to serve growers, dispensaries, caregivers, producers, patients and eventually all end users of cannabis and botanical products.
 
Our mission is to provide pharmaceutical-grade analysis and testing to the cannabis industry, under ISO-17025:2017 guidelines, to ensure consumers and patients know exactly what is in the cannabis they ingest and to help maximize the quality of our client’s products through research, development and standardization.

As a premier cannabis testing laboratory with ISO-17025:2017 accreditation, we take a careful, strategic approach to all of our cannabis testing. A diverse array of tests combined with our lab equipment and analytical instrumentation enable us to accurately test cannabis for potency, the presence of pesticides, microbial contamination, metals and heavy metals, which include, but are not limited to, substances like arsenic, cadmium, lead, or mercury. Not only is testing for potency and Cannabidiol (“CBD”) and tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) content important, we recognize that more profound testing is needed particularly as a true national standard is developed. Digipath Labs is committed to follow Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”), Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), US Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) guidelines, proprietary standard operating procedures (“SOP”), and Good Lab Practices (“GLP”) that are in line with current Federal and State governing bodies. We utilize a variety of tests to safely and effectively share enhanced understanding of the cannabis plant with caregivers, dispensaries and patients. We are committed to the advancement of science by offering a method of standardization for cannabis that is intricate and accurate. This approach and our investment in state-of-the-art testing equipment is of the utmost importance.
 
Digipath Labs screens medicinal and recreational cannabis for potentially harmful contaminants, including:
 
— Residual Solvents (for extracts)
 — Pesticides
 — Mold and Yeast
 — Heavy metals, including mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium and nickel
 — Biological toxins, such as aflatoxin and ocratoxins
 — Microbial contaminants including E. coli, salmonella, Aspergillus and gram negative bacteria
 
Digipath Labs also tests cannabis for its quality, potency, and cannabinoid and terpene profiles, which determine the suitability of specific chemoprofiles for the treatment of specific ailments.
 
We utilize one of our two Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatographs (“UPLC”), which accurately separates and measures the cannabinoid content of any sample of flower, edible, concentrate or other cannabis product. Our Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (“ICP-MS”) is utilized for heavy metals testing, and provides accurate readings for harmful metals ensuring that the Parts Per Billion (“PPB”) are substantially below the regulated and accepted trace amounts. Our laboratory testing equipment is calibrated using third party reference standards to ensure precision measurements throughout the testing process and has been certified by ISO-17025:2017 standards.
 
With accurate science becoming a major part of the cannabis industry, the major question is one of standards; we hold ourselves accountable and provide efficient and accurate research and results to our clients. Our test results are meant to help dispensaries, caregivers and patients know the concentration and quality of their cannabis without having to question the credibility of the data.
 
Market Overview
 
The United States’ legal cannabis market is projected to reach $11 billion in consumer spending in 2018 and more than $23 billion by 2022, according to key insights featured in our newest report: The State of Legal Marijuana Markets, 6th Edition (SOLMM6), co-produced by Arcview Market Research in partnership with BDS Analytics. This growth has the potential to generate more than 467,000 full-time equivalent jobs in 2022. In addition, the Nevada Department of Taxation recently disclosed that it collected more than $5.8 million in tax revenue on the sale of nearly $38 million worth of cannabinoid-related products during the month of October 2017, and more than $69 million in tax revenue on north of $529 million of sales during the first fiscal year since the legalized sale of recreational cannabis went into effect on July 1, 2017. As the cannabis industry continues to expand, we expect to see a parallel increase in state regulations related to the testing and disclosure of cannabis and cannabis related products. We believe that there will be a strong demand for qualified laboratories to perform such testing, both to assist producers of cannabis and cannabis products to meet expected state mandated requirements, and to provide assurance to consumers and state regulators regarding the safety and composition of such products.
 
With increased legalization nationwide, the lab-testing sector is expected to experience substantial growth. GreenWave Advisors, an independent research and financial analyst firm, projects annual revenue of $553 million for lab testing alone if the U.S. legalizes cannabis on a federal level. When adding in related services, such as data analytics and consulting, the revenue potential could surpass $866 million annually. The data troves collected through the testing process are already creating value and could become an increasingly valuable asset and generate substantial revenue for the most accomplished laboratories. This data could also be used to determine specific genetic attributes of targeted cannabinoids and assist with maximizing medicinal benefits and individualized medicine in the future.

Competition
 
The cannabis industry in the United States is highly fragmented, rapidly expanding and evolving. The industry is characterized by new and potentially disruptive or conflicting legislation promulgated on a state-by-state basis. Our competitors include local enterprises, some of which may have financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources greater than ours. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and consultants.
 
Our competitive position depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientists and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products and solutions, the personal relationships of our executive officers and directors, and our ability to secure adequate capital resources. We compete to attract and retain customers of our services. We compete in this area on the basis of price, regulatory compliance, vendor relationships, usefulness, availability, excellent customer service and ease of use of our services.
 
Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is categorized as a Schedule-I controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the United States Department of Justice and is illegal to grow, possess and consume under Federal law. A Schedule-I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” However, since 1995, thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have passed state laws that permit doctors to recommend prescribing cannabis for medical-use and ten states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that legalize the adult-use of cannabis for any reason. This has created an unpredictable business-environment for dispensaries and collectives that legally operate under state-laws but in violation of Federal law. On August 29, 2013, United States Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued the Cole Memo to United States Attorneys guiding them to prioritize enforcement of Federal law away from the cannabis industry operating as permitted under state law, so long as:

● | cannabis is not being distributed to minors and dispensaries are not located around schools and public buildings; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the proceeds from sales are not going to gangs, cartels or criminal enterprises; 
● | cannabis grown in states where it is legal is not being diverted to other states; 
● | cannabis-related businesses are not being used as a cover for sales of other illegal drugs or illegal activity; 
● | there is not any violence or use of fire-arms in the cultivation and sale of marijuana; 
● | there is strict enforcement of drugged-driving laws and adequate prevention of adverse health consequences; and 
● | cannabis is not grown, used, or possessed on Federal properties. 

 
The Cole Memo was meant only as a guide, not a rule of law, for United States Attorneys and did not alter in any way the Department of Justice’s Federal authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law. Moreover, the Cole Memorandum also provided that it could not be used as a defense to any criminal prosecution.
 
On January 4, 2018, United States Attorney General Jefferson Sessions issued a Memorandum to United States Attorneys rescinding the Cole Memorandum, stating that prosecutors should follow well-established principles in effect prior to the issuance of the Cole Memorandum that govern all federal prosecutions in deciding which activities to prosecute under existing federal laws. Federal legislation has been proposed over the years to reschedule or de-schedule cannabis, as well as to transform the Cole Memorandum into a rule of law.
 
The National Marijuana News Corp. – Cannabis News
 
In May 2014, we established an online radio program called The National Marijuana News (“TNMNews”). TNMNews educates the public regarding the political, economic, medicinal, scientific, and cultural dimensions of the rapidly evolving and controversial medicinal and recreational marijuana industry from diverse and dissenting perspectives. We have expanded our web presence as “THE” destination for unbiased news and information on everything marijuana. As we expand TNMNews, we hope to increase advertising revenue, collect user and consumer data and continue to provide a platform for our own products and services.
 
TNMNews is an Internet radio news and talk show featuring unbiased reporting of the burgeoning marijuana industry. Although leaning more towards a medicinal use platform, the show seeks to foster thought-provoking discussion of both the medicinal and recreational marijuana markets.
 
We launched TNMNews’ Internet radio program on Live 365 and several terrestrial radio stations around the country in 2014. Our Facebook page has also garnered over 172,000 page likes and TNMNews has become a leader in cannabis news, interviews and education. We now also broadcast on Facebook live and Spotify.

Competition
 
TNMNews faces competition from traditional news media as well as new publications and web sites devoted to cannabis use. However, most marijuana-themed Internet podcasts are pro-cannabis and appeal to the recreational user. In contrast, we are pioneering a new path down the middle by presenting both sides of marijuana issues in a professional and unbiased format. Major media players are hopping on the marijuana bandwagon. Local publications like the Denver Post and the San Francisco Chronicle have dedicated space to cannabis coverage. The Huffington Post and many of the other major daily newspapers cover cannabis news. MSNBC, CNN, and truTV are developing series around cannabis. We believe that increasing public interest in this topic ensures we will have an audience and be able to attract paid advertisers.
Government Regulation
 
The following is a brief summary of certain statutes, regulations, policies and proposals affecting our media business. For example, radio broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act. This does not comprehensively cover all current and proposed statutes, regulations and policies affecting our media and business. Reference should be made to the Communications Act and other relevant statutes, regulations, policies and proceedings for further information concerning the nature and extent of regulation of our media business. Finally, several of the following matters are now, or may become, the subject of court litigation, and we cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation or its impact on our media business.
 
Federal law regulates the broadcast of obscene, indecent or profane material. Legislation enacted by Congress provides the FCC with authority to impose fines of up to $325,000 per utterance with a cap of $3.0 million for any violation arising from a single act. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the appeals of several FCC indecency enforcement actions. While setting aside the particular FCC actions under review on narrow due process grounds, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the FCC’s indecency policies, and the FCC has since solicited public comment on those policies. We may receive in the future, letters of inquiry and other notifications from the FCC concerning complaints that programming contains indecent or profane language. We cannot predict the outcome of our outstanding letters of inquiry and notifications from the FCC or the nature or extent of future FCC indecency enforcement actions.
 
Customers
 
We provide cannabis lab testing services in Las Vegas to Nevada licensed Medical Marijuana Enterprises (“MMEs”), and have expanded to recreational use facilities with the recently passed legislation that allows for the recreational use of marijuana in Nevada. We sell our services to these enterprises on a fixed fee per test or panel of tests, and offer a discounted price for customers based on volume. On June 17, 2014, Clark County approved a total of 117 special use permits to cultivation and 87 production applicants. There may be some cross-over applicants in this total whereby an applicant was awarded both a cultivation and production permit, and some of these applicants will undoubtedly not be able to commence operations and will lose their permits, but this is generally our pool of customers, along with additional permit holders in the Cities of Las Vegas and North Las Vegas. As of December 25, 2018, MMEs approved by the State of Nevada include 61 dispensaries, with an additional 60 more dispensary licenses pending, 115 cultivators, 81 production facilities, 24 distributors and 11 labs. We have worked with over 85 cultivators and producers in and around Clark and Nye County. As new harvests come to market, we anticipate further customer growth, especially with last year’s legalization of recreational cannabis in the State of Nevada. We also anticipate a steady stream of new Nevada MMEs to become operational and licensed throughout 2019, which should result in additional opportunities for Digipath Labs.
Research and Development
 
We believe that our future success will be impacted by our ability to continue to enhance and broaden our services to meet the evolving needs of a relatively newly regulated cannabis services industry. Our research and development efforts are focused on developing new, complementary solutions to streamline our processes and provide optimal services to both our customers and for regulators.
 
When developing our technical solutions to provide cannabis testing solutions, industry regulatory requirements also dictate that substantial documentation be created to demonstrate data integrity. Our standard operating procedures include streamlined methodologies for generating and maintaining testing services that can be tailored to the variations in other State jurisdictions, as necessary.
 
We expect to continue to invest in our businesses and to invest further as we expand our lab business for cannabis testing to other jurisdictions.

Marketing, Sales and Support
 
We use a range of communication platforms to reach our target customers. The goal of the marketing strategy is to position us as the leading testing company in the botanical, nutraceutical, and cannabis industries in the country. Our marketing efforts include digital/online, industry conferences and affiliations, media outreach, our own TNMNews, direct response and public relations. We believe that these efforts have the ability to deliver our brand message in a powerful way to maximize audience reach.
Seasonality
 
Our businesses are not subject to seasonality.
 
Insurance
 
We do not currently maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance. We intend to obtain such insurance in accordance with customary industry practices when we have sufficient financial resources.
