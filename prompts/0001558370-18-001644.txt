     Item 1. Business
     Overview
     We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on becoming the leader in responsible pain management by developing and commercializing innovative, differentiated products for patients suffering from pain. Our first product, Xtampza, is an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral formulation of oxycodone, a widely prescribed opioid medication. In April 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved our new drug application, or NDA, filing for Xtampza for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.  Certain human abuse potential studies are included in the approved label, as well as data supporting the administration of the product as a sprinkle or administered through feeding tubes.  In June 2016, we announced the commercial launch of Xtampza. 
     Xtampza has the same active ingredient as OxyContin OP, which is the largest selling abuse-deterrent, extended-release opioid in the United States by dollars, with $1.7 billion in U.S. sales in 2017. We conducted a comprehensive preclinical and clinical program for Xtampza consistent with FDA guidance on abuse-deterrence. These studies and clinical trials demonstrated that chewing, crushing and/or dissolving Xtampza, and then taking it orally or smoking, snorting, or injecting it did not meaningfully change its drug release profile or safety characteristics. By contrast, clinical trials performed by us and others — including head-to-head clinical trials comparing Xtampza with OxyContin OP — have shown that drug abusers can achieve rapid release and absorption of the active ingredient by manipulating OxyContin OP using common household tools and methods commonly available on the Internet.  In November 2017, we announced the approval of a Supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA for Xtampza to include comparative oral pharmacokinetic data from a clinical study evaluating the effect of physical manipulation by crushing Xtampza compared with OxyContin OP and a control (oxycodone hydrochloride immediate-release), results from an oral human abuse potential study and the addition of an oral abuse deterrent claim. 
     In addition, our preclinical studies and clinical trials have shown that the contents of the Xtampza capsule can be removed from the capsule and sprinkled on food or into a cup, and then directly into the mouth, or administered through feeding tubes, without compromising their drug release profile, safety or abuse-deterrent characteristics. By contrast, OxyContin OP, which is formulated in hard tablets, has a black box warning label stating that crushing, dissolving, or chewing can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of the active ingredient. We believe that Xtampza can address the pain management needs of patients in the United States who have difficulty swallowing and suffer from pain severe enough to require daily, around the clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.
     In December 2017, we entered into a Commercialization Agreement with Depomed, Inc., or Depomed, pursuant to which Depomed agreed to grant us a sublicense of certain of its intellectual property related to Nucynta ER and Nucynta IR, or the Nucynta Products, for commercialization of such products in the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We closed the transactions contemplated by the Commercialization Agreement, as amended, on January 9, 2018 and we began marketing the Nucynta Products in February 2018. Nucynta ER is an extended release formulation of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around the clock, long term opioid treatment, including neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults, and for which alternate treatment options are inadequate. Nucynta IR is an immediate release formulation of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in adults.

     Since 2010, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of our patented DETERx platform technology, the preclinical and clinical advancement of our product candidates, pre-commercialization activities and the creation and protection of related intellectual property. Since 2011, we have generated limited revenue from product sales and we continue to incur significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Prior to our initial public offering of common stock, or IPO, in May 2015, we funded our operations primarily through the private placement of preferred stock, convertible notes and commercial bank debt. Since our IPO, we have funded our operations primarily through the proceeds of public offerings and sale of our equity securities.
     Background on Chronic Pain and Opioid Abuse
     Patients Suffering from Chronic Pain
     Chronic pain, typically defined as pain that lasts beyond the healing of an injury or that persists longer than three months, is a worldwide problem with serious health and economic consequences. According to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, chronic pain represents a public health crisis of epidemic proportions affecting approximately 100 million people in the United States and 20‑30% of the population worldwide — more than heart disease, cancer and diabetes combined. Common types of chronic pain include lower back pain, arthritis, headache, and face and jaw pain. The prevalence of chronic pain is expected to rise in the future, as the incidence of associated illnesses such as diabetes, arthritis and cancer increases in the aging population.
     Chronic pain leads to over $560 billion in healthcare and productivity costs each year according to the Institute of Medicine. Prescription opioids remain the primary treatment for chronic pain. Chronic pain patients often start treatment with immediate release opioids, but change to extended‑release opioids to achieve more convenient dosing with more consistent blood levels of the active drug. Extended‑release opioids incorporate a large amount of opioid with a time‑release mechanism designed to deliver steady amounts of opioid, typically over 12 to 24 hours.
    
Annual sales from extended‑release and long‑acting opioids represent approximately $5.0 billion (21 million prescriptions) of the approximately $13 billion U.S. opioid market in 2017. OxyContin OP generated U.S. sales of $1.7 billion in 2017, which represents approximately a 15% U.S. market share of all extended‑release and long‑acting opioid prescriptions.
     Prescription Opioid Abuse is an Epidemic in the United States
 Abusers tamper with extended‑release opioid drugs to achieve the euphoria that results from rapid increases in the blood concentration of the active ingredient, a potentially fatal activity known as dose dumping. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, described abuse of prescription drugs in the United States as a growing and deadly epidemic. Deaths in the United States from prescription opioid overdose have grown from approximately 4,000 in 1999 to approximately 16,000 in 2013.
     According to a 2012 study conducted by the CDC, annually there are 144,000 treatment admissions for abuse or misuse of opioids, 560,000 emergency room visits for misuse or abuse of opioids, over 2.5 million individuals who abuse or are dependent on opioids and over 7.3 million non‑medical users who use opioids without prescriptions or for non‑therapeutic effects. The American Journal of Managed Care estimated in a 2013 report that opioid abuse costs public and private healthcare payors over $72 billion annually in direct healthcare costs, including costs of emergency room visits, rehabilitation and associated health problems.
     The FDA has estimated that nearly 35 million Americans have used prescription pain relievers, including opioid‑containing drugs, for non‑prescription purposes at least once in their lifetime. A 2011 research report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimated that between 1999 and 2009 there was a 430% increase in substance‑abuse treatment facility admissions resulting from the use of prescription pain relievers. According to a 2011 study by the University of Michigan, one in 12 high school seniors reported non‑medical use of Vicodin, a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone, and one in 20 high school seniors reported non‑medical use of OxyContin.
     Drug abusers find extended‑release opioids desirable because of the large amount of drug payload, which they attempt to release quickly into the bloodstream to create euphoria. It is difficult for drug abusers to achieve this rapid release and

absorption into the bloodstream by taking multiple intact extended‑release opioid tablets or capsules because doing so often causes sleepiness and/or respiratory distress before euphoria is achieved. Instead, abusers attempt to defeat the extended‑release properties in order to achieve rapid release of the active ingredient. 
     Despite the introduction of OxyContin OP in 2010 as the first FDA‑approved, abuse‑deterrent extended‑release opioid formulation, abuse of extended‑release opioids, including OxyContin OP, continues to be a major public health issue. OxyContin OP, even with its abuse‑deterrent formulation, remains vulnerable to abuse using common household objects, like pill crushers. Third party studies found that abusers of OxyContin OP use various routes of abuse — including snorting, injection and oral abuse — despite its abuse‑deterrent features. In a third party study of OxyContin abusers both before and after OxyContin OP was introduced, researchers found that while the non‑oral route of administration of abuse of OxyContin OP (i.e., injection, snorting and smoking) decreased after its introduction, oral abuse of OxyContin OP increased from approximately 52% to 75% of OxyContin abusers.

     Legislative and Regulatory Actions
     In response to widespread prescription opioid abuse, the U.S. government and a number of state legislatures have introduced, and in some cases have enacted, legislation and regulations intended to encourage the development of abuse‑deterrent forms of pain medications. The FDA has stated that addressing prescription drug abuse is a priority, and the development of abuse‑deterrent opioids is a key part of that strategy.
     In 2010, Purdue received approval for a new formulation of OxyContin, named OxyContin OP, designed to make it more difficult to abuse. In April 2013, the FDA approved new product labeling for OxyContin OP, which, for the first time included abuse‑deterrent product label claims consistent with the FDA’s January 2013 draft abuse‑deterrent product label guidance. At the same time, the FDA withdrew the approval of the original, non‑abuse‑deterrent OxyContin formulation, thus preventing the commercialization of generic versions of the original OxyContin that did not have abuse‑deterrent properties. This decision by the FDA is consistent with its public statement that the development of abuse‑deterrent opioid analgesics is a public health priority.
     Recent actions to address the opioid abuse epidemic include:
    
· | FDA guidance: In January 2013, the FDA introduced draft guidance regarding studies and clinical trials that should be conducted to demonstrate that a given formulation has abuse‑deterrent properties, how those studies and clinical trials will be evaluated, and what product labeling claims may be approved based on the results of those studies and clinical trials. The draft guidance described four categories of abuse‑deterrence studies and clinical trials: Categories 1, 2 and 3 consist of pre‑marketing studies and clinical trials designed to evaluate a product candidate’s potentially abuse‑deterrent properties under controlled conditions, while Category 4 post‑marketing clinical trials and studies assess the real‑world impact of a potentially abuse‑deterrent formulation. These requirements were largely adopted in the April 2015 final FDA guidance, which also provides examples of product label claims that may be made based on the results of the corresponding studies and clinical trials.

· | 48 state and territorial attorneys general support development of abuse‑deterrent opioids: In March 2013, the National Association of Attorneys General urged the FDA to adopt standards requiring manufacturers and marketers of prescription opioids to develop abuse‑deterrent versions of those products. Their letter, signed by

48 state and territorial attorneys general, commended the FDA for expeditiously proposing guidance that establishes clear standards for manufacturers who develop and market abuse‑resistant opioid products, while considering incentives for undertaking the research and development necessary to bring such products to market. It also encouraged the FDA to ensure that generic versions of such products are designed with similar abuse‑resistant features.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA mandated product label changes: On September 10, 2013, the FDA announced its intention to require product label changes to all approved extended‑release and long‑acting opioids. In particular, the FDA announced its intention to update the indications for these opioids so that they will be indicated only for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around‑the‑clock, long‑term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. On April 16, 2014, the FDA updated these indications. The FDA also requires post‑marketing studies and clinical trials for any such opioids.

· | Massachusetts and Maine approved laws to mandate that insurers cover abuse‑deterrent opioids: In August 2014 and June 2015, the governors of Massachusetts and Maine, respectively, signed laws establishing a drug formulary commission charged with identifying drugs with a heightened public health risk due to their potential for abuse and formulations of abuse‑deterrent drugs that may be substituted for these drugs that have a heightened public health risk. When a prescriber writes a prescription for an opioid identified as having a heightened public health risk, the pharmacist must dispense an interchangeable abuse‑deterrent product from the formulary, if one exists, except when the prescriber indicates “no substitution.” The Massachusetts and Maine laws also require insurers to cover abuse‑deterrent opioid drugs on a basis not less favorable than corresponding non‑abuse‑deterrent drugs. Several other states have enacted similar legislation, including Florida, Maryland and West Virginia.

· | FDA Opioids Action Plan: In February 2016, the FDA released an action plan to address the opioid abuse epidemic and reassess the FDA’s approach to opioid medications. The plan identifies FDA’s focus on implementing policies to reverse the opioid abuse epidemic, while maintaining access to effective treatments. The actions set forth in the FDA’s plan include strengthening postmarketing study requirements to evaluate the benefit of long-term opioid use, changing the REMS requirements to provide additional funding for physician education courses, releasing a draft guidance setting forth approval standards for generic abuse-deterrent opioid formulations, and seeking input from the FDA’s Scientific Board to broaden the understanding of the public risks of opioid abuse. The FDA’s Scientific Advisory Board met to address these issues on March 1, 2016. The FDA’s plan is part of a broader initiative led by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to address opioid-related overdose, death and dependence. The HHS initiative’s focus is on improving physician’s use of opioids through education and resources to address opioid over-prescribing, increasing use and development of improved delivery systems for naloxone, which can reverse overdose from both prescription opioids and heroin, to reduce overdose-related deaths, and expanding the use of Medication-Assisted Treatment, which couples counseling and behavioral therapies with medication to address substance abuse. In March 2016, as part of the HHS initiative, the CDC released a new Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The guideline is intended to assist primary care providers treating adults for chronic pain in outpatient settings. The guideline provides recommendations to improve communications between doctors and patients about the risks and benefits of opioid therapy for chronic pain, improve the safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and reduce the risks associated with long-term opioid therapy. Also, in March 2016, the FDA announced required enhanced warnings for immediate-release opioid pain medications related to risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death. The FDA also required safety labeling changes across all prescription opioids related to potentially harmful drug interactions. In August 2016, the FDA announced that it is requiring boxed warnings for prescription opioid analgesics, opioid-containing cough products, and benzodiazepines.

· | U.S. Senate Passed Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act: In March 2016, the U.S. Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Consistent with the initiatives of HHS, this legislation would expand the availability of naloxone, which can counter the effects of opioid overdose, for law enforcement and other first responders. The legislation also calls for HHS to convene an interagency task force to develop best practices for pain management with opioid medications. The legislation would also provide resources to improve state monitoring of controlled substances, including opioids. Other initiatives include resources for treating opioid addiction in incarcerated persons and expanding opioid abuse prevention education and treatment efforts.

· | Introduction of Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act 2.0: On February 27, 2018, a bipartisan group of senators introduced Senate Bill 2456 (S.2456). S.2456 is characterized as “CARA 2.0,” in reference to the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. CARA 2.0 would limit initial prescriptions for opioids to 3 days, while exempting initial prescriptions for chronic care, cancer care, hospice or end of life care, and palliative care. CARA 2.0 would also increase civil and criminal penalties for opioid manufacturers that fail to report suspicious orders for opioids or fail to maintain effective controls against diversion of opioids. The bill would increase civil fines from $10,000 to $100,000, and if a manufacturer fails to maintain effective controls or report suspicious orders with knowledge or willful disregard, the bill would double criminal penalties from $250,000 to $500,000. In addition, in 2017 several states, including Indiana, Louisiana, and Utah, enacted laws that further limit or restrict opioid prescriptions.

      Types of Abuse‑Deterrent Technologies
     In response to the opioid abuse epidemic, the pharmaceutical industry has created a number of abuse‑deterrent products and product candidates, using a variety of technologies. These strategies generally fall under the following categories:
    
· | Physical/Chemical Barriers: Physical barriers are formulations designed to prevent chewing, crushing, cutting, grating or grinding for oral or nasal abuse. Physical and chemical barriers can make it difficult to extract the opioid from the formulation for IV abuse using common solvents such as water. For example, OxyContin OP uses a cured, thermoformed polymer to make the tablets harder to crush for oral or nasal abuse. When crushed, the product gels in the presence of small injectable volumes of liquid, making it more difficult to draw into a syringe.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Agonist/Antagonist Combinations: An opioid antagonist can be co‑formulated with an active opioid ingredient, or agonist, to interfere with or reduce the euphoria associated with abuse.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The antagonist can be physically sequestered in the tablet (e.g., Pfizer’s Embeda®). When taken orally as directed, the majority of the encapsulated antagonist is eliminated in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract and not absorbed into the bloodstream, allowing the active ingredient to work. However, when crushed or dissolved by an abuser or patient, the antagonist is released with the active ingredient and both are absorbed into the bloodstream, with the intent of blunting the euphoric effects of the active ingredient. A problem with this approach is that if the tablet is crushed or dissolved, the antagonist can cause the patient or abuser to experience opioid withdrawal, with potentially serious consequences.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Alternatively, the antagonist can be co‑formulated in a fixed ratio with the active ingredient (e.g., Purdue’s Targiniq™). When taken orally as directed, most of the antagonist is circulated directly to the liver and rendered ineffective, allowing the active ingredient to work. However, when snorted or injected, the antagonist is distributed in the bloodstream before it gets to the liver, with the intent of preventing euphoria. A disadvantage with this approach is that it limits the amount of active ingredient a patient can take, which may make it inadequate to control chronic pain. Further, the presence of the antagonist in the co‑formulated drug may precipitate withdrawal, with potentially serious consequences.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Market research studies performed for us have shown that some physicians prefer not to use an abuse‑deterrent formulation with an opioid antagonist because such formulations may be less useful in addressing chronic pain and because their antagonist components may precipitate withdrawal.
    
· | Prodrug approaches: A prodrug is a drug administered in an inactive, or less active, form designed to enable more effective delivery. The prodrug is then converted by the body into the active ingredient through a normal, metabolic process. In a prodrug opioid, the active ingredient is designed to be released if the drug is taken orally, but if an abuser or patient takes a large amount of the drug, the prodrug is not broken down or absorbed rapidly enough to create euphoria. If injected or snorted, the prodrug is not broken down and the active

ingredient is not released. No opioids using a prodrug approach are currently marketed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other approaches: Some companies are taking different approaches to abuse deterrence, including attempting to slow the rate of the drug’s entry into the brain. No opioids using such novel approaches are currently marketed. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We believe Xtampza represents the best‑in‑class approach to an abuse‑deterrent extended‑release opioid formulation. Xtampza does not incorporate an opioid antagonist, is not a prodrug, and is resistant to abuse through physical or chemical manipulation.
     Chronic Pain with Dysphagia
     It is estimated that more than 10% of patients with chronic pain, or approximately 11 million patients, have dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing, because they have cancer, are elderly, have other medical problems or have difficulty swallowing without a known medical cause. The FDA recognized the unmet medical needs of this growing population in issuing guidance in June 2015, in which the FDA cited survey data that suggest that as many as 40% of Americans may have difficulties swallowing tablets and capsules and noted that these difficulties can precipitate a number of adverse events and noncompliance with treatment regimens.
     Except for Xtampza, all FDA‑approved, orally administered extended‑release opioids have a black box warning product label stating that “crushing, dissolving or chewing can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of the active drug,” making them unsuitable or unattractive for patients who suffer from chronic pain with dysphagia, or CPD. OxyContin OP’s product label states that “there have been post‑marketing reports of difficulty in swallowing OxyContin tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat… Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing.” An external marketing study performed for us in 2013 estimated that Xtampza has a peak revenue potential for U.S. patients with CPD in excess of $700 million annually.
     Our Solution: The DETERx Platform Technology
     Overview
     DETERx is a novel, proprietary, patented platform technology that is designed to maintain the extended‑release and safety profiles of highly abused drugs in the face of various methods of abuse and tampering, including chewing, crushing and/or dissolving, and then taking them orally or snorting or injecting them. The DETERx formulation consists of wax‑based microspheres that are filled into a capsule. The microspheres are spherical micron‑sized beads that are prepared by combining the active ingredient (oxycodone, in the case of Xtampza) with inactive ingredients. Each microsphere, whether inside or outside the capsule, is designed to be abuse‑deterrent and extended‑release. The active ingredient is solubilized and homogenously dispersed in each microsphere.
     Xtampza microspheres have a median particle size of approximately 300 microns and are comprised of the active ingredient (oxycodone), a fatty acid, and wax and surfactant excipients which are all Generally Recognized As Safe, or GRAS, by the FDA. The microspheres are formulated through a proprietary melt process in which the active ingredient, as a free base, is combined with fatty acid and wax and surfactant excipients to form a molten solution in which the base is solubilized via an ionic interaction with the fatty acid. The resulting homogenous liquid is spray congealed into small droplets using a proprietary spinning disk manufacturing process. The droplets rapidly congeal into solid wax‑based microspheres, which are then filled into capsules. Differing product strengths are achieved by varying the weight of the microspheres loaded into a capsule. When administered orally as directed, the Xtampza formulation is designed to be administered every 12 hours and releases oxycodone over an extended period of time in the GI tract by diffusion from the microspheres into gastrointestinal fluids.

     Because of our proprietary DETERx platform technology, each individual microsphere has extended‑release and abuse‑deterrent properties. The microspheres are designed to be administered in capsule form, sprinkled on food or into a cup then directly in the mouth, or administered into the stomach via a gastric or nasogastric tube without compromising their abuse‑deterrent, extended‑release profile. These features may make Xtampza uniquely suited to address the needs of patients suffering from CPD.
     Abuse‑Deterrent Features
     Abusers often seek to accelerate the absorption of opioids into the bloodstream by crushing them in order to swallow, snort or smoke the drug, or dissolving them in order to inject the drug. The wax‑based microspheres produced using the DETERx platform technology have physical and chemical barriers that are intended to reduce the potential for these forms of abuse. We believe that microspheres made using our proprietary technology deter the most common methods of manipulating opioids for abuse because of their features described in the table below.

 Abuse‑Deterrent Features of DETERx Platform Technology

Method of Abuse | Abuse‑Deterrent Feature: | Advantages 
----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oral | Particle Size, Matrix Composition and Fusing Effect | The microspheres are small and soft, so chewing or crushing them to further reduce the particle size does not meaningfully reduce the particle size or increase the surface area. The hydrophobic excipient matrix of each microsphere is composed of soft, fatty, and wax‑based inactive ingredients that tend to agglomerate and fuse when crushed.
Injection | Less Soluble Salt Form | We created a novel salt form of the active ingredient, which is less soluble in aqueous solutions (such as water) but readily dissolved in fatty excipients, such as those used in our DETERx formulation. 
 | Matrix Composition | The hydrophobic excipient matrix is designed to trap the active ingredient, making it difficult for abusers to extract the opioid. 
 | High Melting Point | Melting the waxy composition of the microspheres results in quick solidification when heat is removed, clogging a syringe. 
Snorting | Matrix Composition | The hydrophobic excipient matrix is designed to trap the active ingredient, preventing the release of the opioid in the nose and causing temporary nasal side effects that make Xtampza undesirable for nasal abuse. 

      Pipeline

 We have applied our DETERx platform technology to Xtampza as well as the product candidates in our pipeline, with the exception of the Nucynta Products. We recently completed formulation development work for our extended‑release, abuse‑deterrent hydrocodone program. Based upon an assessment of the market opportunity and the potential to differentiate from currently marketed hydrocodone products as well as programs in development, we are prioritizing our abuse deterrent hydrocodone program as our second product in development. We filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, with the FDA in December 2015 and initiated a clinical trial in the first quarter of 2016. We also have an extended‑release, abuse‑deterrent oxymorphone program for the treatment of chronic pain for which we have filed an IND. This program has been granted Fast Track status by the FDA. In addition, we have other extended‑release, abuse‑deterrent product candidates that have completed preliminary preclinical studies, including morphine for pain and methylphenidate for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.  All of these product candidates share similar abuse‑deterrent qualities as Xtampza and are designed to be suitable for patients with difficulty swallowing. We own all of the rights to Xtampza and our DETERx-based product candidates.
     Each of our product candidates is being developed to seek FDA approval in accordance with Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits an applicant to file an NDA that relies, in part, on data not developed by or for the applicant and to which the applicant has not received a right of reference, such as the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy in the approval of a similar drug, or listed drug, or published literature in support of its application.
     Xtampza
 Overview
     Our first FDA-approved product, Xtampza, is an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral formulation of oxycodone, a widely prescribed opioid medication. In April 2016, the FDA approved our new NDA filing for Xtampza for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Certain human abuse potential studies are included in the approved label, as well as data supporting the administration of the product as a sprinkle or administered through feeding tubes. In June 2016, we announced the commercial launch of Xtampza. In October 2016, we announced the submission of a New Drug Submission to Health Canada seeking marketing approval of Xtampza for the same indication for which we obtained approval from the FDA. 
     Xtampza has the same active ingredient as OxyContin OP, which is the largest selling abuse-deterrent, extended-release opioid in the United States by dollars, with $1.7 billion in U.S. sales in 2017. We conducted a comprehensive preclinical and clinical program for Xtampza consistent with FDA guidance on abuse-deterrence. These studies and clinical trials demonstrated that chewing, crushing and/or dissolving Xtampza, and then taking it orally or smoking, snorting, or injecting it did not meaningfully change its drug release profile or safety characteristics. By contrast, clinical trials performed by us and others — including head-to-head clinical trials comparing Xtampza with OxyContin OP — have shown that drug abusers can achieve rapid release and absorption of the active ingredient by manipulating OxyContin OP using common household tools and methods commonly available on the Internet. In November 2017, we announced the approval of a Supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA for Xtampza to include comparative oral pharmacokinetic data from a recently completed clinical study evaluating the effect of physical manipulation by crushing Xtampza compared with OxyContin OP and a control (oxycodone hydrochloride immediate-release), results from an oral human abuse potential study and the addition of an oral abuse deterrent claim. 
     In addition, our preclinical studies and clinical trials have shown that the contents of the Xtampza capsule can be removed from the capsule and sprinkled on food or into a cup, and then directly into the mouth, or administered through feeding tubes, without compromising their drug release profile, safety or abuse-deterrent characteristics. By contrast, OxyContin OP, which is formulated in hard tablets, has a black box warning label stating that crushing, dissolving, or chewing can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of the active ingredient.

     We believe that Xtampza can capture a significant share of the $5.0 billion U.S. extended‑release opioid market, including a portion of the existing $1.7 billion OxyContin OP market. In addition, we believe that Xtampza can become a market leader for treating patients with chronic pain who have difficulty swallowing.

OxyContin OP Extended‑Release Market
     Purdue launched OxyContin OP in 2010. In April 2013, the FDA determined that Purdue had been successful in demonstrating OxyContin OP’s abuse‑deterrent characteristics and permitted Purdue to amend its product label to include certain abuse‑deterrent claims. Since the launch of OxyContin OP, there has been a reduction in the overall abuse of OxyContin, primarily in the snorted and injected routes of administration.
     Despite OxyContin OP’s commercial success, it carries with it a well‑documented abuse stigma both for physicians who prescribe it and for patients who use it to treat chronic pain. In a market research study conducted for us in 2013, 35% of patients surveyed who were taking OxyContin OP indicated concern that their friends or family have a negative perception of OxyContin OP. Of the 1,021 patients surveyed in the study, 11% of chronic pain patients responded that they have had their opioid medication stolen, most often from their home, and 76% indicated an interest in switching to a pain medication similar to OxyContin OP but that was more abuse‑deterrent. A market research study of 30 physicians conducted for us in 2015 concluded that while physicians view OxyContin OP as an effective and valuable option, one third reported prescribing it less often than they would like because of patients’ reticence to use OxyContin OP because of its reputation for addiction and abuse. 
     Further, in a third party study of post‑marketing data on misuse and diversion of prescription opioid analgesics, the initial decline in abuse of OxyContin OP by patients who reported abusing the non‑abuse‑deterrent OxyContin 30 days prior to entering treatment for opioid abuse disorder, plateaued at 25% to 30%, with no further decreases from 2012 to study conclusion in 2014. A sub‑population of participants was surveyed to investigate their continued abuse of OxyContin. Among the 88 participants who abused both non‑abuse‑deterrent OxyContin and OxyContin OP, their continued abuse of OxyContin OP was explained by: (i) a transition from non‑oral routes of administration to oral use (approximately 43%); (ii) successful efforts to defeat the abuse‑deterrent formulation mechanism leading to a continuation of inhaled or injected use (approximately 34%); and (iii) exclusive use of the oral route independent of formulation type (approximately 23%). Representative comments of participants who continued to abuse OxyContin OP demonstrated that participants were able to identify methods of circumventing the abuse deterrent properties using the internet.
     Other Extended‑Release Opioids
     While OxyContin OP is the largest selling extended‑release opioid in the United States by dollars in 2017, there are approximately 18 million additional prescriptions for non‑abuse‑deterrent extended‑release opioids annually in the United States. Many of these opioids include active ingredients, such as morphine, that are commonly perceived as having greater adverse side effects than oxycodone‑based formulations. Because of the abuse stigma associated with OxyContin OP and non‑abuse‑deterrent opioid formulations, we believe that Xtampza offers physicians treating chronic pain an attractive alternative to the existing options. Our market research also demonstrates that payors recognize the prevalence of opioid abuse and its corresponding economic burden. This research indicates that “brand” prices would be acceptable for products that are differentiated. As such, we aim to achieve broad Tier 3 payor coverage on commercial plans and contract with Medicare and Medicaid. In a market research study conducted for us, 83% of disease specialists (such as oncologists and neurologists) and 67% of pain specialists surveyed indicated that they would prescribe Xtampza for patients without dysphagia.     Chronic Pain with Dysphagia
     In a market research survey conducted for us, of 1,021 patients with chronic pain, 30% of the patients reported that they have trouble swallowing or do not like to swallow pills, and 65% of the patients did not realize that cutting, crushing or grinding extended‑release opioids can change the drug release profile. Most of the currently approved abuse‑deterrent opioid drugs do not have an FDA product label that permits the sprinkling of the product on food or into a cup, and then directly in the mouth and administration through feeding tubes for use by patients with CPD, creating an unmet medical need due to the lack of adequate treatment options.  Further, in an effort to make them easier to swallow, some patients with CPD — and 47 of the 1,021 patients participating in the survey conducted for us — crush their prescribed extended‑release opioids and can inadvertently harm themselves because of the rapid immediate‑release of the active ingredient. Because our Xtampza microspheres are designed to be able to be removed from the capsule and still retain their abuse‑

 
  13

 
deterrent and extended‑release properties, we believe that Xtampza is an effective pain‑management solution for patients with CPD. 
     Nucynta ER and Nucynta IR
     In December 2017, we entered into a Commercialization Agreement with Depomed, pursuant to which Depomed agreed to grant us a sublicense of certain of its intellectual property related to the Nucynta Products for commercialization of such products in the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. On January 9, 2018, we amended the Commercialization Agreement and consummated the transactions contemplated thereby.
     Nucynta ER is an extended release formulation of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around‑the‑clock, long term opioid treatment, including neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults, and for which alternate treatment options are inadequate. Nucynta IR is an immediate release formulation of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in adults. 
     Pursuant to the Commercialization Agreement, we assumed all commercialization responsibilities, including sales and marketing, for the Nucynta Products, while Depomed continues to control manufacturing of the Nucynta Products. We began shipping and recognizing product sales on the Nucynta Products on January 9, 2018. We began commercial promotion of the Nucynta Products in February 2018. We will pay a royalty to Depomed on all revenues from the sale of Nucynta Products based on certain net sales thresholds, with a fixed annual minimum royalty during the first four years of the Commercialization Agreement, subject to certain conditions.
     Onsolis
     In May 2016, we licensed the U.S. rights to develop and commercialize Onsolis from BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc., or BDSI. Onsolis is a Transmucosal Immediate-Release Fentanyl film indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older, who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. In December 2017, after a review of our product portfolio, we provided written notice to BDSI of termination of the License and Development Agreement dated May 11, 2016, or the License Agreement, which termination will be effective pursuant to the terms of such agreement on March 8, 2018. Upon such termination of the License Agreement, our rights to develop and commercialize Onsolis will revert to BDSI.
    
Manufacturing of DETERx Products and Product Candidates
     Overview
     Xtampza and our product candidates created with our DETERx technology platform are manufactured using a proprietary process. This process is reproducible, scalable and cost‑efficient, and we believe that the microsphere formulation — and the related manufacturing process — is unique in the extended‑release opioid market. 
     To date, we have produced Xtampza at a contract manufacturing organization, Patheon. The existing Patheon facility has the capacity to support our commercialization of Xtampza during the first several years after commercial launch. We are working with Patheon to build dedicated manufacturing capacity at Patheon’s existing facility. Patheon has an established record of manufacturing products approved in the United States, including controlled substances.
     We own all of the intellectual property, including know‑how and specialized manufacturing equipment, necessary to be able to replicate the manufacturing equipment currently located at Patheon’s facility at an alternative location (and with an alternative vendor) if necessary.
     Drug Substances
     The active ingredient used in Xtampza, oxycodone base, is an odorless white crystalline powder. We currently procure this active ingredient pursuant to a supply agreement with a single U.S.‑based manufacturer. If our current supplier is 

 
  14

 
unable to supply oxycodone base in the quantities and at the times we require it, we are aware of other suppliers who we would expect to be able to satisfy our commercial orders.
     Oxycodone base is classified as a narcotic controlled substance under U.S. federal law. Xtampza is, and we expect that our product candidates will be, classified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, as Schedule II controlled substances, meaning that they have a high potential for abuse and dependence among drugs that are recognized as having an accepted medical use. Consequently, we expect that the manufacturing, shipping, dispensing and storing of our product candidates will be subject to a high degree of regulation, as described in more detail under the caption “— Governmental Regulation — DEA Regulation.” 
     Marketing and Commercialization
     We are in the process of commercializing Xtampza and the Nucynta Products in the United States with a direct sales force. We plan to explore out‑licensing partnerships for Xtampza in other international markets, such as Canada, Australia and Japan, as well as countries in Latin America and Europe.
     The members of our management team who are leading the commercialization of Xtampza and the Nucynta Products have substantial experience in pharmaceutical sales and marketing. We have a dedicated field sales force, consisting of approximately 131 sales professionals, to call on the approximately 11,000 physicians who write approximately 58% of the branded extended‑release oral opioid prescriptions in the United States, with a primary focus on pain specialists. In addition, we deploy a focused sales force of approximately 14 specialty sales representatives to call on hospitals. In addition, we employ medical sales liaisons, or MSLs, to respond to clinician inquiries about Xtampza. We also employ a market‑access team to support our formulary approval and payor contracting.
     We are continuing to execute our commercialization strategy with the input of key opinion leaders in the field of pain management, as well as healthcare practitioners. We have developed positioning and messaging campaigns, a publication strategy, initiatives with payor organizations, and distribution and national accounts strategies. Our marketing strategy includes increasing awareness of the differentiated features of Xtampza and the Nucynta Products and increasing awareness of solutions for patients with CPD who require or would benefit from extended‑release opioids.
     Intellectual Property 
     We regard the protection of patents, designs, trademarks and other proprietary rights that we own or license as critical to our success and competitive position. Our patent portfolio directed toward Xtampza and our DETERx technology consists of twelve issued patents in the United States (seven of which claim compositions of matter, three of which claims both compositions of matter and methods of use, and two that claim methods of use), one granted and two pending applications in the European Patent Office, two issued patents in Canada, and one issued patent in each of Japan and Australia. Finally, we have six patent applications pending in the United States, one pending patent application in each of Canada and Japan, and one pending PCT application. Our issued U.S. patents are projected to expire in 2023, 2025, 2030, and 2036 and our pending patent applications in the United States, if issued, would be projected to expire in 2023, 2025, 2030, and 2036. In addition, we use a unique and proprietary process to manufacture our products that requires significant know‑how, which we currently protect as trade secrets.
     Our policy is to patent the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business, but only in those cases in which we believe that the costs of obtaining patent protection is justified by the commercial potential of the technology, and typically only in those jurisdictions that we believe present significant commercial opportunities to us. We have concluded that some of our technology is best protected as proprietary know‑how, rather than through obtaining patents. In some cases, we publish the invention such that it becomes prior art in order for us to secure freedom to operate and to prevent a third party from patenting the invention before us. Our technology and products are not in‑licensed from any third party, and we own all of the rights to Xtampza and our 

 
  15

 
product candidates. We believe we have freedom to operate in the United States and other countries, but there can be no assurance that other companies, known and unknown, will not attempt to assert their intellectual property against us.
     We also rely on trademarks and trade designs to develop and maintain our competitive position. We have received trademark registration for Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., DETERx, and Xtampza ER in the United States.
     We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know‑how that is not patentable, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and, in some cases, requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. Additionally, these confidentiality agreements require that our employees, consultants and advisors do not bring to us, or use without proper authorization, any third party’s proprietary technology.
     Our Strategy
     Our goal is to become the leader in responsible pain management by developing and commercializing innovative, differentiated products for patients suffering from pain. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:
· | Grow Xtampza in the United States. We continue to strengthen our commercial organization, including our sales force and commercial manufacturing capacity for U.S. commercialization of Xtampza. Our management team has extensive experience commercializing pharmaceutical products, and we are in the process of expanding sales, marketing and reimbursement functions to grow Xtampza sales in the United States. We are detailing Xtampza to approximately 11,000 physicians who write approximately 58% of the branded extended‑release oral opioid prescriptions in the United States with a sales team of approximately 131 sales representatives. We believe that this physician group also represents a significant portion of the top prescribers of extended‑release and long‑acting opioids (including drugs formulated with fentanyl and methadone) currently used to treat patients with CPD. In addition, we deploy a separate, focused sales team of approximately 14 specialty sales representatives to detail Xtampza to hospitals.

· | Commercialize the Nucynta Products in the United States. In December 2017, we entered into a Commercialization Agreement with Depomed, pursuant to which Depomed agreed to grant us a sublicense of certain of its intellectual property related to the Nucynta Products for commercialization of such products in the United States. We began shipping and recognizing product sales on the Nucynta Products on January 9, 2018, and we began commercial promotion of the Nucynta Products in February 2018. We are detailing the Nucynta Products to substantially the same physicians to whom we detail Xtampza, leveraging our existing sales organization.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Establish strategic collaborations to accelerate and maximize the potential of our products and product candidates worldwide. We intend to seek strategic collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies to commercialize Xtampza and our product candidates outside the United States and to develop certain of our product candidates that are outside of our core therapeutic focus.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Advance other product candidates that incorporate our DETERx platform technology. We have begun advancing our development program for COL‑195, an abuse‑deterrent, extended‑release hydrocodone for the treatment of chronic pain. We initiated clinical trials for our hydrocodone product candidate in the first quarter of 2016. We also have an IND application on file for COL‑172, an abuse‑deterrent, extended‑release oxymorphone for the treatment of chronic pain, which has been granted Fast Track status by the FDA. In addition, we have COL‑171, a proprietary preclinical DETERx extended‑release, abuse‑deterrent methylphenidate formulation for the treatment of ADHD.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquire additional products and product candidates. We may identify and license, co‑promote or acquire products or product candidates being developed for pain indications and other complementary products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our commercialization strategy for our products continues to evolve, and as part of that evolution, we are developing positioning and messaging campaigns, a publication strategy, initiatives with payor organizations, and distribution and 

 
  16

 
national accounts strategies.
     Competition
     Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition and potential competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. Most of the existing and potential competitors have significantly more financial and other resources than we do.     Xtampza
     Currently, the only opioid drugs on the market for chronic pain relief that have an abuse‑deterrent product label are OxyContin OP and Hysingla®, both from Purdue, Embeda from Pfizer, MorphaBond ER from Inspirion Delivery Technologies and Arymo ER from Egalet. Hysingla is a once a day hydrocodone product. Embeda is a combination of morphine and naltrexone, an opioid antagonist that can be sprinkled on soft food but contains a boxed warning on its product label stating that “the capsules are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine.” MorphaBond ER is a twice daily morphine product formulated with a hard tablet and gelling polymers. Arymo is an extended-release morphine product formulated as a hard tablet.
     In addition, there are five other approved extended-release opioids that have abuse deterrent product labeling, Vantrela ER from Teva, Targiniq from Purdue and Troxyca ER from Pfizer, none of which are currently on the market. Vantrela ER is a twice daily hydrocodone product. Targiniq is a combination of oxycodone and naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Troxyca ER is a combination of oxycodone and naltrexone, an opioid antagonist. A number of other large and small companies are developing abuse deterrent drugs for chronic pain. Many other companies have products for the treatment of chronic pain which do not have abuse-deterrent claims in their labels, including Pernix and Mallinckrodt, as well as several generic companies.
     We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our products and product candidates include their degree of abuse deterrence, bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy, and convenience of dosing and distribution, as well as their safety, cost and tolerability profiles. Xtampza may also face competition from commercially available generic and branded extended‑release and long‑acting opioid drugs other than oxycodone, including fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and methadone, as well as opioids that are currently in clinical development, including a generic version of Xtampza ER for which Teva recently submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, to the FDA and which is the subject of patent infringement litigation filed by us in February 2018.
     Xtampza competes against all extended‑release opioids, including Purdue’s OxyContin OP for the treatment of patients experiencing pain severe enough to require around-the-clock, long-term analgesia. Although no generic oxycodone extended‑release products are currently commercially available, it is possible that generic forms of OxyContin OP could become available, in which case Xtampza would compete with any such generic oxycodone extended‑release products.  
     Additionally, we are aware of companies with abuse‑deterrent oxycodone product candidates in late-stage development, including Egalet, Intellipharmaceutics, Nektar Therapeutics and Pain Therapeutics.  If these products are successfully developed, approved for marketing and become commercially available, they could represent significant competition for Xtampza. It is also possible that a company that has developed an abuse‑deterrent technology could initiate an abuse‑deterrent oxycodone program at any time.
     Nucynta
     Nucynta ER competes against other long-acting opioid medications, including among others: OxyContin; Butrans; Belbuca; and Embeda.
     Nucynta IR competes primarily against short-acting opioids used for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in adults. There are numerous such medicines, including, among others: generic hydrocodone acetaminophen; generic oxycodone; generic oxycodone acetaminophen; and generic tramadol.

     Government Regulation
     FDA Approval Process
     In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FD&C Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. Failure to meet FDA requirements for approval would also result in a medication not being approved for marketing.
 The process of developing a pharmaceutical and obtaining FDA approval to market the medication in the United States typically involves:
    
· | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication for which FDA approval is sought;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre‑approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

      Satisfaction of FDA pre‑market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
     Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long‑term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
     The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by FDA unless, within the 30‑day time period, the FDA raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
     Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights, safety and wellbeing of subjects and to define the 

 
  18

 
roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; and (ii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and any effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
     GCP requirements include that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. An independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the informed consent information as well as the clinical trial protocol before the trial commences at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. The FDA or the IRB may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time and on various grounds, particularly upon the belief that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects, or impose other conditions.
     Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients, and is tested to assess safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, PK, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common AEs and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive Phase 3 clinical trials. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit‑risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the clinical trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report key parameters of certain clinical trials at the NIH‑maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov.
     After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
     The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Rather than accept an NDA for filing, then FDA may request additional information. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and may be subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review. The FDA has established certain performance goals for the review of new drug applications. The agency endeavors to review applications for standard review drug products within 10 to 12 months of the acceptance for filing, and aims to review applications for drugs granted priority review, which may apply to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, within six to eight months. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late‑submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
     The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee — typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts — for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with 

 
  19

 
GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
     After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, and when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
     An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Changes to certain of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses similar procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
     REMS
     The FDA has the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition of the approval of an NDA or after approval to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary for a new drug, the drug sponsor must submit a proposed REMS plan as part of its NDA prior to approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and Elements To Assure Safe Use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy, at a minimum, at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the REMS approval. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
     In February 2009, the FDA informed manufacturers of certain opioid products that it would require a REMS for their opioid drug products. Subsequently, the FDA initiated efforts to develop a new standardized REMS for these opioid medications to ensure their safe use, and in July 2012, approved a class‑wide REMS for extended‑release and long‑acting opioid products. Extended‑release formulations of oxycodone, morphine, hydrocodone and hydromorphone, for example, are required to have a REMS. Manufacturers subject to this class‑wide REMS must work together to implement the REMS as part of a single shared system to reduce the burden of the REMS on the healthcare system. The central component of the extended release/long acting opioid REMS program is an education program for prescribers and patients. Specifically, the REMS includes a Medication Guide available for distribution to patients who are dispensed the drug, as well as a number of ETASU. These ETASU include training for healthcare professionals who prescribe the drug; information provided to prescribers that they can use to educate patients in the safe use, storage, and disposal of opioids; and information provided to prescribers of the existence of the REMS and the need to successfully complete the necessary training. Prescriber training required as part of the REMS is conducted by accredited, independent continuing education providers, without cost to healthcare professionals, under unrestricted grants funded by the opioid analgesic manufacturers. Moreover, REMS assessments must be submitted on an annual basis to assess the extent to which the ETASU are meeting the goals of the REMS and whether the goals or elements should be modified.
     As part of the FDA’s Opioid Action Plan, the agency intends to update the extended-release and long-acting opioid REMS after having evaluated existing requirements and considered recommendations from the joint meeting of the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee and the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory 

 
  20

 
Committee on May 3-4, 2016.  The recommendations from that meeting included: extending training to other health care professionals involved in the management of patients with pain; expanding the REMS requirements to include the immediate-release opioid analgesic drug manufacturers; and evaluating the best approach to implementing mandatory prescriber education on pain management.
     Advertising and Promotion
     The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off‑label” uses — that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug’s labeling — because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off‑label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.     Fast Track Designation
 The FDA has various programs to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track designation program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the submission of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request.
     In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s NDA before the application is complete. The FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
     Post‑Approval Requirements
     Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion restrictions.
     Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post‑market testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration subjects entities to periodic announced or unannounced inspections by the FDA or these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, other regulatory actions may be taken, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.

 As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and associated regulations, impose certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements and other limitations on the distribution of drug samples to physicians. The PDMA also requires that state licensing of distributors who distribute prescription drugs meet certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA and a growing majority of states also impose certain drug pedigree requirements on the sale and distribution of prescription drugs. The PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations. In 2010, a statutory provision was enacted that required manufacturers and authorized distributors of record to report on an annual basis certain information about prescription drug samples they distributed. The FDA issued a draft compliance policy guide on the reporting requirement. The FDA stated that it would exercise enforcement discretion with regard to companies that have not submitted reports until the FDA finalizes the reporting requirement and/or provides notice that it is revising its exercise of enforcement discretion.
     The FDA may require post‑approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug.
     The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments
     Orange Book Listing
     In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or efficacy of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
     The ANDA applicant is required to make certain certifications to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than make certifications concerning a listed method‑of‑use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
     A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
     Exclusivity
    
 
  22

 

 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA, discussed in more detail below, that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug. A drug may obtain a three‑year period of exclusivity for a change to the drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the labeling or a new formulation, during which FDA cannot approve an ANDA or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA, if the supplement includes reports of new clinical trials (other than bioavailability clinical trials) essential to the approval of the supplement.
     An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
     Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
     Generally, drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on data not developed by the applicant, such as the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy in the approval of a similar product or published literature in support of its application.
     Section 505(b)(2) NDAs may provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional clinical trials or provide additional materials to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
     To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Thus approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired; until any non‑patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired; and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. In the interim period, the FDA may grant tentative approval. Tentative approval indicates that the FDA has determined that the applicant meets the standards for approval as of the date that the tentative approval is granted. Final regulatory approval can only be granted if the FDA is assured that there is no new information that would affect final regulatory/ approval. As with traditional NDAs, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three‑year marketing exclusivity, assuming the NDA includes reports of new clinical trials (other than bioavailability clinical trials) essential to the approval of the NDA.
     Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
     Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to post certain information regarding the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
     DEA Regulation
     Our first product, Xtampza, is regulated as a “controlled substance” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation 

 
  23

 
and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
     The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule II drugs are those that meet the following characteristics:
    
· | high potential for abuse;
--+--------------------------


· | currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | abuse may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | are considered “dangerous.”
--+----------------------------

      Xtampza, an abuse-deterrent oral formulation of oxycodone, is listed by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA. The Nucynta Products are also listed by the DEA as Schedule II controlled substances under the CSA. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, storing, selling and using of the products is subject to a high degree of regulation. Schedule II drugs are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription.
     Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
     The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special permits and notification requirements apply to imports and exports of narcotic drugs.
     In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. Because Xtampza is regulated as a Schedule II controlled substance, it is subject to the DEA’s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much oxycodone may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate amount of opioids that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We and our contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule I or Schedule II substance, including oxycodone base for use in manufacturing Xtampza. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments.
     To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or 

 
  24

 
diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
     Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products.
     International Regulation
     In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval and, if applicable, DEA classification. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
     Many foreign countries are also signatories to the internal drug control treaties and have implemented regulations of controlled substances similar to those in the United States. Our products will be subject to such regulation which may impose certain regulatory and reporting requirements and restrict sales of these products in those countries.
     Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. In addition, as with HIPAA in the United States, the collection and use of personal health data in the EU is governed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), with many requirements mandated by the GDPR for the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, transfer of personal data within and outside of the EU and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. Enforcement of the GDPR is scheduled to begin on May 25, 2018, and failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR may result in substantial fines and other administrative penalties.
     In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement and commercial distribution of our products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
     Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
     In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the DOJ, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with fraud and abuse laws such as the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, as amended and similar state laws. In order to participate in the Medicaid program, existing federal law requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates to state governments, based on a statutory formula, on covered outpatient drugs reimbursed by the Medicaid program as a condition of having their drugs paid for by Medicaid. Manufacturers are required to report AMP and best price for each of their covered outpatient drugs to the government on a regular basis. Additionally, some state Medicaid programs have imposed a requirement for supplemental rebates over and above the formula set forth in federal law, as a condition for coverage. In addition to the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal law also requires that if a pharmaceutical manufacturer wishes to have its outpatient drugs covered under Medicaid as well as 

 
  25

 
under Medicare Part B, it must sign a “Master Agreement” obligating it to provide a formulaic discount that results in a federal ceiling price, or maximum price that participating manufacturers may charge for covered drugs sold to the U.S. Departments of Defense (including the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Veterans Affairs, the Public Health Service and the Coast Guard, and also provide discounts through a drug pricing agreement meeting the requirements of Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act, for outpatient drugs sold to certain specified eligible health care organizations. The formula for determining the discounted purchase price under the 340B drug pricing program is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and rebate amount for a particular product as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, discussed above.
     The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, on the other. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include the transfer of anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at other than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti‑Kickback Statute liability in all cases. The reach of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute was broadened by the recently enacted Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, some of which apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some cases, and do not contain safe harbors.
     The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third‑party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper promotion of off‑label uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug’s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. To the extent we participate in government healthcare programs, our future activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. Also, HIPAA created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

 
  26

 

     In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities in the future may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain “covered entities,” which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards through HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
     Additionally, under the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, manufacturers of drugs for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) must report information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations must report ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. Such reports are to be made to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, by the 90th day following the end of each subsequent year and CMS subsequently is to publish the reported information on a publicly available website.
     There are also an increasing number of state “sunshine” laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Such legislation also prohibits pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing and prohibits certain other sales and marketing practices. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
     Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre‑marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are approved and sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
     Third‑Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
     The commercial success of Xtampza, the Nucynta Products and our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third‑party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Third‑party payors include governmental programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care plans. These third‑party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third‑party payors 

 
  27

 
have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost‑containment mechanisms and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments.
     The cost of pharmaceuticals and devices continues to generate substantial governmental and third‑party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third‑party payor policies as well as healthcare legislative reforms.
     Some third‑party payors also require pre‑approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost‑containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for Xtampza, the Nucynta Products and our product candidates and to operate profitably.
     In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies.
     Healthcare Reform
     In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. The Medicare Modernization Act imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand‑alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non‑governmental payors.
     The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness clinical trials are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third‑party payors do not consider our products to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which includes measures to significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following:
    
· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  28

 

    
· | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point‑of‑sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a licensure framework for follow‑on biologic products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if Congress does not act on the recommendations (the IPAB has not yet been called upon to act as the annual determinations by the CMS Office of the Actuary have not identified a savings target for implementation in years 2015 or 2016); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.
     In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the repeal will result in over 13 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage over the next ten years, and is likely to lead to increases in insurance premiums. It is uncertain how or whether this legislation may affect our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.
     Other Regulatory Requirements

     We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us.     Research and Development
     We incurred research and development expenses of $8.6 million, $14.9 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 250 full‑time employees. Of these, 19 were engaged in full‑time research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective‑bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
