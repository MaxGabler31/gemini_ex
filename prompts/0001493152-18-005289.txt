Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 
On October 2, 2017 Heatwurx, Inc., “(Heatwurx”) and Processa Therapeutics, LLC (“Processa”), a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Heatwurx, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with Promet Therapeutics, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Promet”) pursuant to which, at the effective time on October 4, 2017, Heatwurx acquired all of the assets of Promet, in exchange for issuing to Promet approximately 222,217,000 shares (approximately 31,745,000 shares following our reverse stock split) of the common stock of Heatwurx. Following the closing, Heatwurx changed its name to Processa Pharmaceuticals, Inc. As used in this Form 10-K, unless the context suggests otherwise, “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company” or “Processa” refer to Processa Pharmaceuticals, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries and the acquired assets from Promet.
 
Following the acquisition, we have abandoned our prior business plan and we are now pursuing Promet’s historical business and proposed business, with a focus on developing drugs to treat patients that have a high unmet medical need.
 
Overview
 
Processa is an emerging pharmaceutical company focused on the clinical development of drug products that are intended to improve the survival and/or quality of life for patients who have a high unmet medical need. Within this group of pharmaceutical products, we currently are developing one product for two indications (i.e., the use of a drug to treat a particular disease) and searching for additional products for our portfolio. 
 
Part of our business strategy is:
 

(i) | to identify drugs that have potential efficacy in patients with an unmet medical need, as demonstrated by some clinical evidence, even if it be anecdotal, such that the patient’s survival and/or quality of life might improve, 
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | to identify drug products that have been developed or approved for other indications but can be repurposed to treat those patients who have an unmet medical need, and 
(iii) | to identify drugs that can be quickly developed within 2-4 years to completion of a pivotal study for the submission of a new drug application (“NDA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or to license the drug to a potential strategic partner just prior to a more expensive and time consuming pivotal study. 

 
Processa’s lead product, PCS-499 (previously known as CTP-499), is an oral tablet that is an analog of an active metabolite of an already approved drug. The advantage of PCS-499 is that it potentially may work in many conditions because it has multiple pharmacological targets that it affects that are important in the treatment of these conditions. The compound has previously been shown to be safe and tolerable with a trend toward efficacy in diabetic nephropathy. Based on the pharmacological activity, Processa has identified other unmet medical need conditions where the use of PCS-499 may result in clinical efficacy. These include Necrobiosis Lipoidica (NL) and Radiation-Induced Fibrosis (RIF) in head and neck cancer patients. NL is a chronic, disfiguring condition for which most patients do not have any treatment options. It develops more commonly in women than in men on the lower extremities, and ulceration can occur in approximately 30% of NL patients, which may lead to more severe complications, such as deep tissue infections and osteonecrosis that can threaten life of the limb. The Processa development team has already met with the FDA on the NL condition and has developed a strategy for moving the program for NL forward starting with a Phase 2 clinical trial in NL patients in late 2018. The Processa team will meet with the FDA to further define the program for use of PCS-499 for the RIF condition in the next few months. CTP-499 had previously been investigated for a different indication in Phase 2 studies before we exercised an option to license CTP-499 from CoNCERT Pharmaceuticals in March 2018. Based on the diverse pharmacological activity of CTP-499, the Processa team has defined a strategy to develop this product in two indications where physicians and patients seek significant medical help. CTP-499 will be investigated for the treatment of two conditions that occur as a result of multiple pathophysiological changes, necrobiosis lipoidica and the adverse effects associated with radiation therapy in the treatment of head and neck cancer. Besides the diverse pharmacological properties of CTP-499 targeting many of the physiological changes that occur for these two indications, an analog drug with similar pharmacology, presently approved for a different indication, has been successfully used in some patients for the treatment of these indications but cannot be used in many patients because it has dose limiting side effects, not allowing for higher doses to be administered to obtain adequate efficacy. The CTP-499 dose limiting side effects appear to occur at a much higher dose based on the existing clinical and pre-clinical data for CTP-499, allowing physicians to potentially increase the dose to effectively treat significantly more patients with these two conditions. These two indications do not have any FDA-approved treatments, have the potential to seriously affect a patient’s day-to-day quality of life and have projected maximum annual gross sales of $750 million to $2 billion worldwide. Our team had a successful pre-IND (Investigating New Drug) meeting with the FDA on necrobiosis lipoidica in October 2017, defining the next steps to move CTP-499 into Phase 2 studies and the path to eventual approval. Our ability to generate meaningful revenue from any products in the United States depends on obtaining FDA authorization. Even if our products are authorized and approved by the FDA, we must still meet the challenges of successful marketing, distribution and consumer acceptance.

To advance its mission, Processa has assembled an experienced and talented management and product development team. The Processa team is experienced in developing drug products through all principal regulatory tiers from Initial New Drug (“IND”) enabling studies to NDA submission. The Company’s combined scientific, development and regulatory experience has resulted in more than 30 drug approvals by the FDA, over 100 meetings with FDA and involvement with more than 50 drug development programs, including drug products targeted to patients who have an unmet medical need.
 
In parallel the Processa team is looking to acquire additional drug candidates to help patients who have an unmet medical need. Processa has evaluated over 50 potential assets for acquisition and is presently performing due diligence on a cancer drug and a drug used for a cardiovascular condition that has no approved treatment.
 
Research and Development, Product Manufacturing, and Clinical Supplies 
 
We currently have no in-house laboratory, drug manufacturing, product manufacturing, or clinical facilities. We rely on third-party contract labs, animal facilities, clinical facilities, and drug manufacturers to make the material used to support the development of our product candidates and to execute the actual studies. However, the study designs and the final evaluation/interpretation of the data are made by Processa with the third-party contractors providing the hands-on services to perform the studies. We purchase the material used in our clinical trial activities from various companies and suppliers.
Customers and Distribution
 
As we are still in the process of developing our products, we do not currently sell or distribute pharmaceutical products.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success will depend in large part on our ability to:
 

● | obtain and maintain international and domestic patent and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | prosecute and defend our patents, once obtained; 
● | preserve our trade secrets; and 
● | operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties. 

 
We intend to seek appropriate patent protection for product candidates in our research and development programs where applicable and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for composition of matter, medical uses, processes for preparation and formulations.
 
We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and any continuing innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for, or adequate remedies to protect, our technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors.

Asset Acquisitions by Licensing Agreements or Company Acquisitions
 
On March 19, 2018 Promet, Processa and CoNCERT Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“CoNCERT”) executed an Amendment to the Option Licensing Agreement granting an exclusive license, including the right to assign the license, sublicense, develop, manufacture, use and commercialize CTP-499 worldwide. Upon exercising the option to license CTP-499, Promet transferred $8.0 million of its Processa shares, approximately 5.9% of all Processa outstanding shares, to CoNCERT with CoNCERT also being eligible to receive royalties on commercial sales. Promet with CoNCERT’s agreement has subsequently assigned the license to Processa after exercising the licensing option
 
We have also evaluated over 50 potential assets for acquisition and are presently performing due diligence on a cancer drug and a drug used for a cardiovascular condition that has no approved treatment. If one or both of these assets are a good fit for our portfolio, we will try to acquire the asset through in-licensing or acquisition of the Company.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We do not currently have sales or marketing capabilities. In order to commercially market any pharmaceutical product that we successfully advance through preclinical and clinical development and for which we obtain regulatory approval, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third parties with sales and marketing capabilities. Because of the early stage of our pharmaceutical development programs, we have not yet developed a sales and marketing strategy for any pharmaceutical products that we may successfully develop.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive. Our potential competitors in the field are many in number and include major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, they may have substantially more experience in effecting strategic combinations, in-licensing technology, developing drugs, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products. We cannot give any assurances that we can compete effectively with these other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our potential competitors in these markets may succeed in developing products that could render our products and those of our collaborators obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in the fields in which we compete.
Government Regulation
 
Pharmaceutical Regulation
 
If we market any pharmaceutical products in the United States, they will be subject to extensive government regulation. Likewise, if we seek to market and distribute any such products abroad, they would also be subject to extensive foreign government regulation.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products. FDA regulations govern the testing, manufacturing, advertising, promotion, labeling, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and generally require a rigorous process for the approval of new drugs.
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state generally must decide whether to recognize approval.
 
The definition of “rare or orphan disease” differs between the US and other foreign countries, and as such may impact the development program, the regulatory approval process, the exclusivity marketing periods, sales and marketing and the pricing. Since many of the products being developed will be used in rare diseases the differences in the regulations between the US and other foreign countries may add complexity to the development program, the clinical studies, regulatory approval and costing for the product.
 
Regulation in the United States
 
The FDA testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and money. We cannot assure you that any of our products will ever obtain approval. The FDA approval process for new drugs includes, without limitation:
 

● | preclinical studies; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for clinical trials; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy of the product; 
● | review of a New Drug Application, or NDA; and 
● | inspection of the facilities used in the manufacturing of the drug to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations. 

 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and effectiveness of the product. Most of these studies must be performed according to good laboratory practices, a system of management controls for laboratories and research organizations to ensure the consistency and reliability of results. The results of the preclinical studies, existing clinical and/or human use data (if applicable) together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which we are required to file before we can commence any clinical trials for our product candidates in the United States. Clinical trials may begin 30 days after an IND is received, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials. If concerns or questions are raised, an IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot assure you that submission of any additional IND for any of our preclinical product candidates will result in authorization to commence clinical trials.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate that is the subject of the trial to volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution at which the study will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution arising from the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. Also, clinical trials must be performed according to good clinical practices, which are enumerated in FDA regulations and guidance documents.
 
Clinical trials typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2 and 3. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including if the FDA makes a finding that the subjects participating in the trial are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
In Phase 1 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on patients to determine safety, any adverse effects, proper dosage, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects.
 
In Phase 2 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a limited number of subjects to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
 
In Phase 3 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a larger number of subjects in an expanded patient population and at multiple clinical sites.

We cannot assure you that any of our current or future clinical trials will result in approval to market our products.
 
An NDA must include comprehensive and complete descriptions of the preclinical testing, clinical trials and the chemical, manufacturing and control requirements of a drug that enable the FDA to determine the drug’s safety and efficacy. A NDA must be submitted, filed and approved by the FDA before any product that we may successfully develop can be marketed commercially in the United States.
 
The facilities, procedures and operations for any of our contract manufacturers must be determined to be adequate by the FDA before product approval. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP, licensing specifications and other FDA regulations before and after a NDA has been approved. Foreign manufacturing facilities are also subject to periodic FDA inspections or inspections by foreign regulatory authorities. Among other things, the FDA may withhold approval of NDAs or other product applications if deficiencies are found at the facility. Vendors that may supply us with finished products or components used to manufacture, package and label products are also subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections.
 
In addition, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulatory requirements on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet.
 
Failure to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA’s review of NDAs, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
Since we plan to market our products in foreign countries, we may also be subject to a wide variety of foreign regulations governing the development, manufacture and marketing of our products. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must still be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies, and the time needed to secure approval in any region such as the European Union or in a country with an independent review procedure may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We cannot assure you that clinical trials conducted in one country will be accepted by other countries or that an approval in one country or region will result in approval elsewhere.
Additional Regulation
 
Third-Party Reimbursement
 
In the United States, physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase pharmaceutical products generally rely on third-party payors, principally private health insurance plans, Medicare and, to a lesser extent, Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the product and procedure for which the product is being used. Even if a product is approved for marketing by the FDA, there is no assurance that third-party payors will cover the cost of the product and related medical procedures. If they do not, end-users of the drug would not be eligible for any reimbursement of the cost, and our ability to successfully market any such drug would be materially and adversely impacted.
 
Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. Reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many foreign markets, including markets in which we hope to sell our products, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government pricing control. In these markets, once marketing approval is received, pricing negotiations could take significant additional time. As in the United States, the lack of satisfactory reimbursement or inadequate government pricing of any of our products would limit their widespread use and lower potential product revenues.

Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Federal and state anti-kickback and anti-fraud and abuse laws, as well as the federal Civil False Claims Act may apply to certain drug and device research and marketing practices. The Civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States. Actions under the Civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or by a private individual acting as an informer or whistleblower in the name of the government. Violations of the Civil False Claims Act can result in significant monetary penalties. The federal government is using the Civil False Claims Act, and the threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers, suppliers and drug and device manufacturers throughout the country for a wide variety of drug and device marketing and research practices and has obtained multi-million-dollar settlements. The federal government may continue to devote substantial resources toward investigating healthcare providers’, suppliers’ and drug and device manufacturers’ compliance with the Civil False Claims Act and other fraud and abuse laws. We may have to expend significant financial resources and management attention if we ever become the focus of such an investigation, even if we are not guilty of any wrong doings.
HIPAA
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, requires the use of standard transactions, privacy and security standards and other administrative simplification provisions, by covered entities which include many healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA instructs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations implementing these standards in the United States.
Other Laws
 
We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, and various federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of material into the environment.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 13 employees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor or trade union, and we believe that our relations with our employees is good. We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced personnel, but competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the individuals needed.
Status as an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as that term is defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (i.e., those that have not had a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are required to comply with such new or revised financial accounting standards.
 
The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period provided by Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act and comply with the requirements that apply to nonemerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We may still take advantage of all of the other provisions of the JOBS Act, which include, but are not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
