Item 1. Business
General 
Charlotte’s Web Holdings, Inc., (“Charlotte’s Web”, the “Company” or “we”), a benefit company under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) ("BCBCA"), S.B.C. 2002, c. 57, as amended, including the regulations promulgated thereunder, and a Certified B Corp headquartered in Denver, Colorado, was incorporated under the BCBCA on May 18, 2018 under the name Stanley Brothers Holdings Inc. On July 12, 2018, the Company changed its name to Charlotte’s Web Holdings, Inc. On August 29, 2018, the Company filed articles of amendment to amend its share capital in connection with its initial public offering to authorize the issuance of common shares ("Common Shares"), preferred shares and proportionate voting shares ("Proportionate Voting Shares") of the Company. On November 3, 2021, all outstanding Proportionate Voting Shares of the Company were converted by way of mandatory conversion in accordance with the Company’s Articles and at the discretion of the Company, into Common Shares. Pursuant to the Company’s Articles, the Company is no longer authorized to issue additional Proportionate Voting Shares. The Company’s Common Shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") under the symbol, “CWEB.” The Company’s Common Shares are also quoted on the over-the-counter stock market, the OTCQX, in the United States under the symbol, “CWBHF."
The Company is a market leader in innovative hemp extract wellness products under a family of brands which includes Charlotte’s Web™, CBD Medic™, CBD Clinic™, and Harmony Hemp™. Charlotte’s Web branded premium quality products start with proprietary hemp genetics that are 100% North American farm grown and manufactured into hemp extracts containing naturally occurring phytocannabinoids including cannabidiol ("CBD"), cannabichromene ("CBC"), cannabigerol ("CBG"), cannabinol ("CBN"), terpenes, flavonoids and other beneficial hemp compounds. The Company moved into its new current good manufacturing practices ("cGMP") facility in Louisville, Colorado, (the "LOFT"), during the second quarter of 2020 at which the Company conducts its production, distribution, and quality control activities, and has expanded its research and development ("R&D"). Charlotte’s Web product categories include full spectrum hemp extract oil tinctures (liquid products), gummies (sleep, stress, immunity, exercise recovery), capsules, CBD topical creams and lotions, as well as products for pets. Charlotte’s Web products are distributed to more than 15,000 retail outlets and 8,000 health care practitioners, and online through the Company’s website at www.CharlottesWeb.com. The information provided on the Charlotte’s Web website is not part of this report or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.
The business of the Company consists of the farming, manufacturing, sales, and marketing of products of hemp-derived CBD wellness products. As of December 31, 2021, the Company operated in a single operating and reportable segment, hemp-derived CBD wellness products, as its executive officers reviewed overall operating results in order to assess financial performance and to make resource allocation decisions, rather than to assess a lower-level unit of operations in isolation.
Hemp extracts are produced from the plant Cannabis sativa L. ("Cannabis") and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol ("THC") concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis ("Hemp"). The Company is engaged in research involving a broad variety of compounds derived from Hemp. Where such research indicates that a product with a greater than 0.3% THC level may have a potential therapeutic use, the Company may consider pursuing development of that use in jurisdictions where it is legal to do so in accordance with applicable regulations and if consistent with the Company’s founding principles.
The Company does not currently produce or sell medicinal or recreational marijuana or products derived from high-THC Cannabis plants. On March 2, 2021, Charlotte’s Web executed an Option Purchase Agreement (the “SBH Purchase Option”) pursuant to which the Company has the option to acquire Stanley Brothers USA Holdings, Inc. (“Stanley Brothers USA”), a Cannabis wellness incubator. Until the SBH Purchase Option is exercised, both Charlotte’s Web and Stanley Brothers USA will continue to operate as standalone entities in the US. Outside of the 
US, the companies are able to explore opportunities where Cannabis is federally permissible. At this time, however, the Company does not have any plans to expand into high-THC products in the near future.
The Company holds the number one market share position across major retail channels including total US food/drug/mass retail, total US natural specialty retail, and e-commerce, based on market share data from leading third-party analysts such as Nielsen Company (US), LLC (“Nielsen”), SPINS, LLC (“Spins”) and Brightfield Group (“Brightfield”), respectively.
The Company grows its proprietary hemp domestically in the United States on farms leased in northeastern Colorado and sources high quality hemp through contract farming operations in Kentucky and Oregon.
The Company continues to invest in R&D efforts to identify new product opportunities. Management is working to expand the Company’s production capacity, sales and marketing infrastructure, and to find opportunities for continuous improvement in the supply chain and proactively define the competitive landscape. The Company is working to capitalize on the rapidly emerging botanical wellness products industry by driving customer acquisition and retention, as well as accelerating national and international retail expansion. In addition, the Company may consider expanding its product line beyond Hemp-based products should the science and the Company’s founding principles support such expansion.
In furtherance of the Company’s R&D efforts, the Company established CW Labs, an internal division for R&D, to substantially expand the Company’s efforts around the science of hemp derived compounds. CW Labs aims to support the Company’s product portfolio with studies and science-based innovation. CW Labs is currently engaged in double-blind, placebo-controlled human clinical trials addressing hemp-based solutions for several need states. CW Labs is located in Louisville, Colorado at the Company’s production and distribution facility and the Hauptmann Woodward Research Institute on the campus of the University at Buffalo’s Jacobs School of Medicine and The Center for Integrated Global Biomedical Sciences through which it fosters collaborations throughout the State University of New York network of 64 national and international research and medical institutions. In November 2019, the Company announced a collaboration between CW Labs and the University at Buffalo’s Center for Integrated Global Biomedical Sciences to advance hemp cannabinoid science through a research program that provides a better understanding of the potential therapeutic uses of cannabinoids.
Public Benefit Company Status
In August 2019, at the annual general and special meeting of the holders (the "Shareholders") of the Company's voting shares, the Company’s Shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Notice of Articles and Articles to allow the Company to become a benefit company under the BCBCA, as a demonstration of its long-term commitment to conducting its business in a responsible and sustainable manner and promoting one or more public benefits. The Company became a benefit company under the BCBCA on July 24, 2020.
Benefit companies are a relatively new class of corporations in British Columbia that are formally and legally empowered to conduct their business in a responsible and sustainable manner and promote one or more public benefits. Under British Columbia law, benefit companies are required to identify in their Articles the public benefit or benefits they will promote. Their directors have a duty to act honestly and in good faith with a view to conducting business in a responsible and sustainable manner and to promote the company’s public benefits and must balance this duty with their general fiduciary duties under section 142(1)(a) of the BCBCA to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company. As a benefit company, the Company must balance a variety of interests that may result in actions that do not maximize shareholder value as the board of directors of the Company (the "Board" or the "Board of Directors") must balance the interests of shareholders and stakeholders in working to achieve the Company’s public benefits. See “Risk Factors – As a public benefit company, the Company has a duty to balance a variety of interests that may result in actions that do not maximize Shareholder value.”
In practice, the Board of Directors of the Company takes an expanded view of decision making to balance their fiduciary duties and their duty to act honestly and in good faith with a view to conducting business in a responsible and sustainable manner and to promote the Company’s public benefits, including weighing potential conflicts of 
interest and ultimately making decisions that the Board believes most appropriately address all of the Board’s duties. British Columbia courts have generally been deferential to the business decisions of directors, as directors are in the best position to take into account the diverse interests of a company and its stakeholders (including what weight to give to shareholder interests), as long as the business decision lies within the range of reasonable alternatives. However, as a new type of corporate entity, there is uncertainty as to how British Columbia courts would view the balancing of these interests and the weighing of shareholder and stakeholder concerns. See “Risk Factors - As a benefit company, the Company may be subject to increased legal proceedings concerning its duty to balance Shareholder and public benefit interests, the occurrence of which may have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.”
Benefit companies also are required under the BCBCA to publish on their websites and provide to their shareholders an annual benefit report that assesses, against a selected third-party standard, their performance, in carrying out the commitments set out in the benefit company’s benefit provisions. The Company’s annual benefit report discloses, in relation to the most recently completed fiscal year, (a) a fair and accurate description of the ways it demonstrated commitment to conducting its business in a responsible and sustainable manner, and to promoting the public benefits specified in its Articles; (b) a record of assessment based on a third-party standard; and (c) the circumstances, if any, that hindered the Company’s endeavors to carry out the commitments set out in the Company’s benefit provision. For so long as the Company is a benefit company under the BCBCA, the Company will include an annual benefit report as part of its annual proxy materials sent to its Shareholders and post the report to its website.
For the Company’s benefit report relating to the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company selected B Lab as the third-party standard against which to measure its performance. B Lab conducted a B Impact Assessment of the Company. The B Impact Assessment is an assessment of a company’s governance and its impact on its workers, customers, community, and environment. The B Impact Assessment of the Company is posted on the B Lab website and was included in the Company’s inaugural benefit report in respect of the year ended December 31, 2020.
The Company’s public benefit, as provided in its Articles, is “to pioneer the way to healthier lives, stronger communities, and a more bountiful planet by making it easier for everyone to access the natural restorative power of plants.” Accordingly, this social focus includes contributing to non-profit organizations and charities, which are made on an ad hoc basis, concentrating first on those entities that have historically supported the business through education of existing and potential customers. The Company also supports non-profits that it believes can utilize the wellness aspects of its products (i.e., military veterans, adaptive athletes, educational organizations, etc.). By doing so, the Company believes that socially oriented actions will ultimately have a positive impact on the Company, its employees, and its Shareholders. 
In addition to being a benefit company, the Company is a “Certified B Corp”, as certified by B Lab, the US non-profit organization which administers this certification . Certified B Corps (also referred to as B Corps) are for-profit companies that use the power of business to build a more inclusive and sustainable economy. Certified B Corps are required to consider the impact of their decisions on all stakeholders: customers, workers, communities, and the environment. These requirements are aligned with the Company’s socially conscious founding principles, and formalizes its commitment to environmental, social, and governance issues for stakeholders. The Company’s status as a Certified B Corp is distinct from and has no impact on its status as a benefit company under the BCBCA. Though the Company has chosen to use B Lab’s criteria for its required annual impact assessment under the BCBCA, the Company is not required to do so and could select another criteria if it desired.
History and Development of the Company
The seven Stanley brothers (the "Stanley Brothers") founded CWB Holdings, Inc. (predecessor to Charlotte's Web, Inc. ("CW"), a subsidiary of the Company) on December 8, 2013.

On August 30, 2018, the Common Shares commenced trading on the Canadian Stock Exchange ("CSE") under the symbol “CWEB.”
Between 2016 and 2017, the Stanley Brothers made the decision to expand cultivation activities into Kentucky and Oregon to diversify CWB Holdings, Inc.’s Hemp farming operations for the purpose of (i) hedging production against weather-related events, and (ii) accessing services of experienced hemp farming operations with a view to maintain access to an additional supply of Hemp.
In June 2020, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Abacus Products, Inc. ("Abacus") (formerly known as Abacus Health Products, Inc.) pursuant to the terms of an arrangement agreement (the "Arrangement Agreement"). 
Abacus Health Products, Inc. ("Abacus U.S.") was formed in September 2014 as a subsidiary of Aidance Scientific, Inc. ("Aidance"), a developer and manufacturer of topical dermatology products founded in 2004. Leveraging the resources and know-how of Aidance under licensing rights and manufacturing and services agreements, Abacus U.S. pursued in 2015 the development of a line of topical pain relief medications. The commercialization of products under the CBD CLINIC™ line started in the third quarter of 2016 to healthcare practitioners throughout the United States that specialize in pain management, particularly in the chiropractic industry. By January 2017, Abacus U.S. was selling CBD CLINIC™ products directly to approximately 100 practitioners. During the year, Abacus U.S. also began selling its CBD CLINIC™ products through national distributors that sell to practitioners, mainly chiropractors and massage therapists. By December 2018, an estimated 10,000 practitioners had become customers and resellers of CBD CLINIC™ products.
In 2017, Abacus U.S. introduced three analgesic massage oils under the CBD CLINIC™ line and, later in 2017, Abacus U.S. developed a pain stick that allowed the user to apply the medication without needing to touch the ointment with one’s hands. Sales for the pain stick grew quickly following its launch in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Also in 2017, Abacus U.S. began developing its CBDMEDIC™ line of products, to be sold to retailers and directly to consumers. Abacus U.S. launched the commercialization of these products in the third quarter of 2018. Abacus U.S. then began selling its CBDMEDIC™ products to retail pharmacy chains and directly through its e-commerce platform.
On December 21, 2018, Abacus, Abacus U.S. and World Wide Subco Inc. (“MergerSub”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Abacus, entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which Abacus U.S. and MergerSub agreed that MergerSub would merge with and into Abacus U.S. under the Delaware General Corporation Law, with Abacus U.S. being the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, upon closing on January 29, 2019, the securityholders of Abacus U.S. became securityholders of Abacus and Abacus U.S., as the surviving corporation under the merger, became the operating subsidiary of Abacus.

These are among the first hemp CBD cultivars on the LOAC that are early flowering and early maturing for outdoor cultivation and harvesting within the shorter Canadian growing season. The approved cultivars include the Company’s original “CW1AS1” U.S. patented genetics, which clears the way for Charlotte’s Web to cultivate its leading CBD wellness products in Canada in 2021. Currently, Charlotte’s Web Products are not easily available in Canada because laws do not allow for bulk importing of USA grown hemp CBD or related products into Canada. In addition to the Company’s CW1AS1 cultivar used for its leading Original Formula and other full-spectrum hemp extract products, Charlotte’s Web is bringing two early maturing hemp varieties to Canada – named “Duchess” and “Ambassador” - developed for cultivation in shorter northern climate growing seasons. Charlotte’s Web’s approved cultivars are three of 15 added to the 2021 LOAC.

Any such offering must also comply with applicable U.S. securities laws. On May 6, 2021, the Company received a receipt for the (final) short form base shelf prospectus from the Ontario Securities Commission on behalf of all applicable regulatory authorities.
On May 5, 2021, the Company announced it has teamed up with United States women’s soccer icon and leader Carli Lloyd. Lloyd partnered with CBDMedic™ after beginning to use its topical CBD products following a knee injury and surgery last year. In doing so, Lloyd has become an advocate for the use of hemp-derived CBD to help athletes and people suffering with pain to find all-natural relief. Lloyd attributes her use of CBDMedic™ as a key factor in her recovery. During her recovery, Lloyd began using CBDMedic™ topical products, including Active Sport™ Pain Relief Ointment and Active Sport Pain Relief Stick, which she applies to sore muscles. She also applies CBDMedic™ Arthritis Aches and Pain Relief Cream when she is experiencing joint pain and stiffness. All CBDMedic™ products are THC-free.
On June 3, 2021, the Company announced the collaboration of its CW Labs division on a preclinical sleep and anxiety study with the University of Colorado-Boulder’s REACH (Research and Education Addressing Cannabis and Health) Center.

The Company is the only hemp CBD brand supporting the University of Colorado REACH Center’s milestone study.
On June 4, 2021, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to establish an at-the-market equity program (the “ATM Program”). The Company may distribute up to C$60,000,000 of Common Shares of the Company (the “Offered Shares”) under the ATM Program. Distributions of the Offered Shares through the ATM Program are made pursuant to the terms of an equity distribution agreement with Canaccord Genuity Corp. and BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. (together, the “Agents”). The Offered Shares may be issued by the Company to the public from time to time, through the Agents, at the Company’s discretion. The Offered Shares sold under the ATM Program are sold at the prevailing market price at the time of sale under the ATM Program, and for the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued 4,740,300 Offered Shares at an average price of $1.85 per share for gross proceeds of $8,714,202 . For the year ended December 31, 2021, share issuance costs were $596,403 for net proceeds to the Company of $8,117,799. The Company became an SEC reporting entity beginning on January 4, 2022. As of that date, the ATM Program ceased to be available to the Company. Thereafter, the manner in which the Company raises capital will likely require that the Company file registration statements with the SEC related to such activities, which will likely increase the time and expense associated with such activities.

Business of the Company
Business Objectives and Strategy
The Company is a market leader in the production and distribution of innovative hemp-derived wellness products. Through its substantially vertically integrated business model, the Company strives to improve customers’ lives and meet their demands for stringent product quality and consistency.
Charlotte’s Web’s mission is to unleash the healing power of botanicals with compassion and science benefiting the planet and all who live upon it. The Company does this by responsibly growing its proprietary non-GMO hemp genetics on family farms that are made into premium, full-spectrum phytocannabinoid health and wellness products. Charlotte’s Web is manufactured in a third-party certified FDA-registered facility.
The above statements capture the essence of the Company’s business strategy and pioneering vision of its founders. The Company strives to realize significant growth by expanding further into the health and wellness sector, while capitalizing on the Company’s unique differentiators to create sustainable value. Lastly, in accordance with the Company’s social responsibility goals, Charlotte’s Web supports several non-profit organizations that utilize its products or that further consumer education, advocacy, and research in the hemp and CBD marketplaces.
Industry Overview
The Company’s primary products are made from high quality and proprietary strains of whole-plant hemp extracts containing a full spectrum of phytocannabinoids, including naturally occurring CBD. Full Spectrum Hemp Extracts ("FSHE") are produced from Hemp. The Company does not produce or sell medicinal or recreational marijuana or products derived from high-THC marijuana plants.
Historically, the health and wellness benefits of hemp-based products focused on protein and nutritional oil content. Hemp seeds are known to provide both protein and valuable omega fatty acids. However, beginning with the publication of United States Patent No. 6,630,507 (cannabinoids as antioxidants and neuro-protectants) issued to the United States Department of Health and Human Services on October 7, 2003, consumer interest surrounding the health and wellness benefits of cannabinoids grew significantly. This interest continued until the passage of 2014 Farm Bill, which created a path for institutions of higher education and state departments of agriculture to cultivate hemp for research purposes under certain conditions.
Hemp extracts contain an assortment of naturally-occurring substances, including phytocannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and other hemp compounds. The Company believes the presence of various phytocannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids work synergistically to heighten the effects of the products, making them superior and distinctly different to single-compound CBD isolates. This assortment of hemp compounds is the basis for the theory known as the “entourage effect” as introduced by Israeli chemists, Shimon Ben-Shabat and Raphael Mechoulam, in 1998.
Although research regarding the potential therapeutic uses of CBD and FSHE are still in their infancy, industry reports suggest consumers are using CBD for various applications including assistance with sleep, daily stress, anxiety, pain relief, cognitive function and immune health, among other applications.
In addition to the industry and consumer reported uses of FSHE containing natural occurring levels of CBD, significant research is currently being conducted on the potential therapeutic use of FSHE as it relates to the following, among other topics: epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder, cancer, autism, neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory effects, anti-tumor effects, and anti-psychotic effects.
Product Overview
Product Portfolio
The Company offers a mix of products that have been strategically developed to fit with its objective of delivering a full suite of best-in-class FSHE wellness products that meet its customers’ demands for stringent quality and consistency. The Company currently markets its products under the “Charlotte’s Web”, “CW”, “CBD CLINIC”, “CBDMEDIC” and “Harmony Hemp” trade names. The Company’s current product categories include human ingestible products (tinctures, capsules, gummies and sprays), topicals, and pet products. The acquired brands of Abacus include CBD CLINIC, CBDMEDIC, and Harmony Hemp. The acquisition of these brands substantially expanded the Company’s topical offerings and presence in both the key food and mass and health practitioner markets.
Human Ingestible Products – Tinctures
A human ingestible liquid product is a combination of oil and full spectrum hemp extracts containing naturally occurring CBD. Ingestible liquid products are delivered in either coconut-based medium chain triglyceride (“MCT”) oil or olive oil, in some cases with flavor. Liquid products are meant to be consumed by direct ingestion. The Company currently has 25 ingestible liquid products.
Human Ingestible Products – Capsules
Ingestible capsule products have standardized amounts of FSHE. Original capsule products were in the form of a dry powder, inside a hard-capsule shell. Dry capsule products combine FSHE with common industry raw materials, including rice bran, maltodextrin, microcrystalline cellulose and fractionated coconut oil. The capsule itself is derived from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. In 2019, CW innovated its capsule offering, introducing liquid capsules that deliver the same quality ingredients. Ingredients in liquid capsules include carrier oil (extra-virgin organic olive oil) and FSHE. The capsules are constructed with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, which reduces oxidation to naturally extend shelf life and maintain the integrity of the high-quality ingredients. The liquid capsules are non-GMO, gluten-free, kosher, 100% vegan and allergen free.
Capsule products are meant to be consumed by direct ingestion. The Company currently has seven capsule products.
Human Ingestible Products – Gummies
The Company’s FSHE gummies are made from whole-plant hemp extract and nutraceutical blends and are flavored with natural juices. The product is meant to be consumed by direct ingestion. The Company has 17 gummy products.
Human Ingestible Products – Sprays
The Company’s sprays are made from THC-Free hemp extract minor cannabinoids, and botanical extracts. The product is meant to be consumed by direct ingestion. The Company has two spray products.
Topicals
The Company’s topical products are delivered in cream, balm, gel, roll-on, ointment, other cosmetic type forms. These products are combinations of Hemp, plant-based oils, herbal extracts and other ingredients. Topical products are meant to be applied externally and by topical application. The Company currently has 102 topical products.
Pet
The Company pet products are currently for canine use. Ingestible pet products are delivered in liquid (drops) and solid (chew) forms. Ingredients are a combination of oil and FSHE. The pet line was developed in adherence with the strict quality standards of the National Animal Supplement Council (“NASC”), which has a quality seal audit program and the mission of which is to promote the health and well being of companion animals and horses that are given animal health supplements by their owners, and to protect and enhance the animal health supplement industry. A review of those companies certified by NASC shows that Charlotte’s Web is one of only a few hemp companies to be certified under the NASC’s quality standards. Liquid canine products are delivered in coconut-based MCT oil with or without flavor. The liquid and solid products are meant to be consumed by direct ingestion or added to food. In addition, the Company has a hemp infused balm for dogs with sensitive skin. The Company currently has 18 pet products.
Key Competitive Advantages of Product Offering
Charlotte’s Web’s founders, the Stanley Brothers, have garnered substantial international media and legislative attention over the past several years, strengthening the Company's brand.
In addition to the power of the Charlotte’s Web brand and substantial goodwill generated from the Company’s legislative efforts and media exposure, the Company's believes the following are also competitive advantages of the Company:
a.Cultivation Experience and Capacity — With years of experience in plant cultivation, the Company has selected prime farmland to grow its hemp with access to substantial additional farmland for future capacity. The Company is also exploring international cultivation and distribution opportunities. The Company believes there is no other entity in the world with more experience bringing large-scale, hemp-based operations to the market while maintaining impeccable product quality.
b.Industry-leading Manufacturing Capability — CW leases a 136,610-square-foot industrial building located at the LOFT at 700 Tech Court in the Colorado Technology Center in Louisville, Colorado, which houses its primary production and R&D divisions. This facility is staffed with professional personnel responsible for production management, quality control/assurance, analytical chemistry, product development and process engineering to ensure product quality.
c.Control of Supply Chain — The Company is substantially vertically-integrated and maintains control over its proprietary genetics throughout the entire cultivation and extraction processes — from seed/clone to packaged products. The Company currently uses select contract manufacturers for topicals and capsules who manufacture products according to the Company’s specifications and standards. Some companies in the CBD industry produce their products from imported hemp pastes of unknown origin, quality, and purity.
d.Rigid Quality Management System — The Company has implemented a rigid quality management system that includes documented internal quality processes and both internal testing laboratories as well as independent third-party testing laboratories.
e.Proprietary Genetics — The Company has been granted U.S. and Canadian Utility Patents for its hemp genetics. The Company has earned a total of four U.S. Utility Patents and one Canadian Utility patent covering hemp varieties as it advances the science of hemp horticulture. The Company believes that the positive media exposure surrounding its proprietary strains have made Charlotte’s Web one of the most sought-after brands in the emerging hemp and CBD markets. Furthermore, the Company developed and launched a fully integrated breeding program in 2017 to further the genetic IP portfolio started by the Stanley Brothers.
f.Protection of Intangible Assets — The ownership and protection of the Company’s intellectual property is a significant aspect of the Company’s future success. Currently the Company protects its intangible assets through trade secrets, technical know-how, and proprietary information. The Company protects its intellectual property by seeking and obtaining registered protection (including patents and trademarks) where possible, developing and implementing standard operating procedures and entering into agreements with parties that have access to the Company’s inventions, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information such as business partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, to protect the Company’s confidentiality and ownership of its intellectual property. The Company also seeks to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of its inventions, trade secrets, trademarks, technical know-how, and proprietary information by maintaining physical security of the Company’s premises and physical and electronic security of the Company’s information technology systems.
The Company has sought trademark and patent protection in the United States, Canada and other countries. The Company’s patent portfolio (patents and patent applications) covers, among other things, the Company’s plant genetics, extraction and cannabinoid isolation, and conversion processes and designs. There can be no guarantee, however, that the Company’s efforts to secure trademark or patent protection will be successful. The duration of the protection afforded by the Company’s registered intellectual property varies by the nature of the registration, but the Company manages renewals and notices on an on-going basis to ensure that the Company’s intellectual property is protected to the full extent possible under applicable law. See [Item 1A - “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to the Company’s Business and Industry – The Company’s intellectual property may be difficult to protect.”]

Cultivation
The Company’s proven cultivation practices have been engineered for scalability to meet long-term sales demand projections. The Company has conducted extensive development over the past several years to demonstrate that it can scale its cultivation operations significantly without sacrificing quality and consistency.
The Company has established infrastructure across three states in order to diversify the seed supply and maintain hemp biomass consistency through standardized mechanization. If needed, the Company believes it will be able to continue to rapidly scale cultivation by: (i) expanding cultivation sites; (ii) diversifying cultivation geographies to extend growing seasons and mitigate crop risk; (iii) increase seed production capabilities; and (iv) further mechanizing cultivation processes to ensure that raw material demand is satisfied without sacrificing quality and consistency.
The Company cultivated 6 acres of irrigated farmland in Colorado for the 2021 growing season and harvested 26,000 lbs. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, the Company produced 675,000 lbs., 2,340,000 lbs. and 157,000 lbs., respectively, of hemp in three states. Given the large harvest in 2019 the Company anticipates that it has enough hemp inventory to meet its future sales projections and potential for new revenue streams to further monetize parts of its supply chain for two years or more. In 2021, the Company’s focus in cultivation continued to be on international market entrance through cultivation and in R&D, plant breeding and regional plant variety trials. The Company is planning on multiple research plots across three growing regions with proven success. This will allow the Company to create early maturing times for northern latitude variety specific cultivars and innovate cannabinoid developments for expanded product offerings.
The Company maintains title to its hemp plants throughout the growing process. The Company grows its hemp plants outdoors on farms and is therefore subject to seasonal weather patterns in North America. The seeds or propagation are typically planted in the May-June timeframe and have no CBD content until September. The plants are then typically completely harvested and processed by the end of November of each year.
Cultivation Overview
The Company currently grows its proprietary hemp plants in northeastern Colorado, Kentucky, Oregon, and Canada on owned and/or leased farmland operated by the Company or third-party farming operators. The Company is actively involved in all aspects of genetics development, propagation, seed production, cultivation, and harvesting. All hemp cultivation activities are done under the oversight of, and licensed by, each state’s Department of Agriculture, or Health Canada, each of which rigorously tests the Company’s crops to ensure compliance with each Department’s Hemp programs (including THC content of less than 0.3% on a dry weight basis). The Company and its third-party farming operators are in compliance with the regulations as outlined by each applicable Department of Agriculture and all hemp produced and sold by the Company constitutes hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill, as well as the laws of the states in which it produces and sells such hemp.
Colorado
The Company currently leases land upon which it operates multiple farms across northeastern Colorado, allowing for required organic crop rotation among locations and providing flexibility to expand the number of acres farmed. The Company’s first harvest in 2014 proved a new concept in large-scale hemp cultivation for the proprietary 
variety which is used to create the Charlotte’s Web products. Since 2014, the Company has continuously scaled and innovated its cultivation techniques and technology. The Colorado farming operations are operated solely by the Company’s personnel to provide the lowest cost of goods sold without compromising high quality standards, while at the same time creating plants, seeds and cultivation practices. The cultivation division also operates a small number of greenhouses used for seed and clone production in northeastern Colorado.
The Company believes the availability of leased land in northeastern Colorado is sufficient to meet its future growing requirements in the region.
Kentucky
In 2015, the Company began cultivation in Kentucky, the second leading hemp producing state in the United States, behind Colorado. The Company operates in Kentucky with third-party farming operators at local farmers. During 2015 and 2016, the crops grown were intended for both seed and the development of mechanizing harvest techniques through the modification of current modern agriculture equipment. The Company is in constant communication with these farms concerning its seasonal growing requirements. The estimated acreage and availability is determined during the year prior to planting and the final acreage for the yearly lease is determined early each year and contracted for accordingly. The Company believes the availability of leased land in Kentucky is more than sufficient to meet its future growing requirements.
Oregon
The Company established an operating relationship with a third-generation farming family that has been farming in the region since 1950. The Company extended its contract for the 2019 grow season and minimally extended in 2020. All farming is done with oversight by the Company to ensure quality standards and specifications are met. Acreage for future expansion continues to be readily available.
Canada
The Company conducted research trials in 2019 and 2020 in its successful attempt to register three varieties under Health Canada’s list of approved cultivars. At the present, these varieties are being cultivated in the Okanagan Valley in central British Columbia and will be used for the Company’s supply chain to enter the Canadian market through an asset light approach. The Company does not own inventory in Canada but intends to licenses its brand, processes, products and formulations to licensed Canadian entities.
Cultivation Research & Development
Since its first crop production in 2014, the Company has taken a leadership position in advancing the technology surrounding all aspects of Hemp production. The Company’s R&D efforts are being driven both by the increasing demand for the Company’s products and its desire to create an expanded portfolio of products that serve the customers’ needs and creating improved varieties for cultivation success in northern latitude regions such as Canada and potentially Europe. The Company’s baseline varieties, developed by the Stanley Brothers, were not proven to be successful in growing in regions outside of Colorado. For this reason, the Company launched its breeding division in 2017 for the purpose of hybrid development to allow successful expansion to other growing regions and international markets. 
Breeding Division
The breeding division supports the Company in a myriad of ways, but its main purpose is to expand the Company’s proprietary hemp variety portfolio. This allows for successful cultivation expansion in both US and International markets, as well as creating innovative cannabinoid development for expanded product development. The breeding program has five variety patents, including two hemp hybrid varieties with proven disease resistance and increased 
yield which lowers cultivation costs of production. In addition to hybrid development, the division oversees the Company’s seed production and supply, import/export requirements, R&D hemp regulatory compliance, assists in State and Federal legislative efforts and supports cultivation operations.
Planting
The Company has successfully created a feminized seed protocol, which provides the scalability and standardization of specific plant genetics. Feminized seeds are seeds which have been bred to produce female plants. Prior to this innovation, the Company’s plant supply line was limited by both infrastructure and plant propagation (creating plants from mother plants). Although propagation was instrumental to the Company’s prior cultivation objectives, it was not a fully scalable process and did not address the Company’s objective to continuously lower production costs and remain a leader in the industry. The Company’s feminized seed protocol took three years to fully understand, optimize, and prove valid through the Company’s quality systems. The Company has built an adequate supply line of seed production to meet expanding future demand for the Company’s products. The Company expects all future production acres to be planted in feminized seeds, by a global positioning satellite driven tractor and a customized planter for optimal germination or seed transplant success. With this innovation, the Company’s proprietary hemp crops can be planted in the same manner as a conventional commercial farming crop.
Harvesting
Harvesting continues to be a significant challenge in the broader Hemp industry with current practices following the processes of the tobacco industry. Once the plants are harvested from the fields, they are hung upside down in outdoor dry structures. The dried plants are then further processed off the plant stalk for final storage. If processed at the correct moisture content, the shelf life of the harvested plants is proven to remain stable for at least four years. However, this method of drying creates scalability issues and can also cause potency loss in the raw material. With this harvesting process, there are limitations applicable to both available infrastructures and labor in agricultural regions. To mitigate these challenges, the Company has focused its Colorado, Kentucky, and Oregon cultivation teams on the development of new, more scalable processes to mechanize harvesting without sacrificing quality. With capital investments in 2019 made in each state, the Company has successfully scaled the harvesting and drying process and believes it has enough capacity to meet the Company’s medium-term needs.
Manufacturing
The Company’s manufacturing operations are centered around the quality of its products and the efficiency of their production. The Company has proprietary extraction processes currently in use and is developing the next generation of processes and equipment to serve the Company’s expanding production requirements and product offerings. The Company operates its finished products manufacturing in accordance with cGMP to create high quality products in the market.
In 2020, the Company began operating from a new 136,610-square foot manufacturing and extraction, warehouse, and distribution facility. The LOFT has been constructed using state of the art processes and equipment to deliver superior products to the Company’s customers. The facility is optimized to efficiently execute the Company’s core competencies in R&D, product development, quality control, and product delivery.
The Company believes it has sufficient capabilities to meet its core production requirements in the near-term. The new facility also has been designed to accommodate incremental manufacturing capacity as business needs require, including the strategic internalization of contract manufactured items.
Arrangements with Suppliers and Manufacturers
The Company currently contracts key parts of supply chain management, including manufacturing, production, and packaging for non-proprietary aspects of its manufacturing process for certain of its products. These large-scale 
manufacturers reduce the reliance on internal manufacturing resources and allow for rapid scaling of production on an as needed basis.
Extraction and Product Formulation
The Company’s harvested hemp is delivered to the Company’s production facility in a coarse-ground form. At the facility, the extraction processes do not commence until the raw hemp material passes initial screenings for moisture content and toxic mold by-products (aflatoxins). Upon passing these screenings, the raw hemp material passes through one of two different extraction processes. The Company utilizes both Carbon Dioxide super critical fluid extraction (“SFE”) and Alcohol Extraction (“AE”) processes. These two processes and the resultant extracts have differing phytochemical profiles, which appeal to different customer bases. Years of R&D and process refinement associated with both of the Company’s extraction processes are proprietary.
After processing, both the SFE and AE extracts are rigorously batch tested both internally and by third-party laboratories for cannabinoid potency, residual solvents, heavy metals, and pesticides. After passing these quality control tests, both the SFE and AE extracts are released into finished products production, where they are diluted with carrier food oils, either medium chain triglycerides from coconut oil or olive oil, or otherwise added to the Company’s products, including the chews or topical products. Some of the SFE extract is dedicated to capsule production.
The Company’s topical, chews, and liquid products are currently blended, flavored, filled, labeled, and packaged into consumer cartons at either its production facility or at contract manufacturer facilities. The Company is working to qualify additional third-party contract manufacturers to ensure adequate encapsulation, bottling, and packaging capabilities necessary to meet demand for the Company’s products.
Quality Management Systems
In 2020, the Company was the first hemp extract company to receive an NSF certification. NSF International’s dietary supplements certification is the only national standard that establishes requirements for the ingredients in dietary and nutritional supplements and is considered the gold standard for products in the dietary supplement space. Additionally in January 2022, the Company was the first hemp extract company to achieve International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") 17025 certification. This certifies that the Company meets the technical and quality benchmarks by ISO 17025 for analytical chemistry testing methods. 
The Company employs cGMP at each stage of its production. cGMP refers to the current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations enforced by the FDA.1 Adherence to cGMP regulations assures the identity, strength, quality, purity, and composition of products by requiring that manufacturers adequately design, monitor, and control manufacturing operations. This includes establishing strong quality management systems, obtaining appropriate quality raw materials, establishing comprehensive standard operating procedures, detecting and investigating product quality deviations and maintaining reliable testing practices. This formal system of controls helps in preventing instances of contamination, deviations, failures and errors. This ensures products manufactured under cGMP meet quality standards.
The Company’s products meet regulatory guidelines for contaminants and are tested by independent third-party laboratories. Products are tested for, among other items: identity, potency, residual solvents, microbial contaminants, aflatoxin, heavy metals, and pesticides.
To create the highest quality products, the Company, when applicable, closely controls every step in the production process, including propagation, cultivation, harvesting, drying, manufacturing, and packaging. The control and visibility maintained through the Company’s substantial vertical integration allows for the continual monitoring and refinement of critical processes, resulting in high quality standardized products.

Sales and Distribution Strategy
The Company’s products are distributed through its e-commerce website (www.charlottesweb.com), third-party e-commerce websites, select distributors, health practitioners, and a variety of brick-and-mortar retailers.
The Company’s products were introduced in late 2014, with 2015 representing the first year of meaningful sales volume, primarily through direct-to-consumer online sales. After commencing interstate shipping in March 2015, sales have continued to show a steady growth trend. The Company’s products are sold in chiropractic and doctors’ offices, gyms, massage therapy offices, salons, animal clinics, and pet stores. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s products were sold in over 15,000 retail locations across the United States, including national grocery, drug, mass market, pet, natural, and specialty retailers. In addition, the Company’s products are sold in over 8,000 health care practitioners’ offices across the United States.
The Company distributes its products within the United States and, on a limited basis, internationally. Retail distribution has evolved from a strategy focused on gaining broad distribution within the natural channel, to now focusing on gaining distribution in major food and mass market accounts. The Company targets accounts where the brand is most likely to succeed with retail shoppers.
The Company’s internal sales team has a two-pronged approach to building distribution: (i) focus on gaining distributors with access to key strategic verticals in the medical and natural channels; and (ii) contracted broker teams that assist in driving brand representation in larger food accounts. The Company believes this model is extremely effective in targeting accounts with the right message to build and capitalize on the Company’s brand momentum.
The Company believes broad brand recognition and increasing market demand in the adaptogenic supplements category (where CBD is typically positioned) results in strong brand sales, which helps promote increased category development and new account acquisition. As the Company continues to develop increasingly sophisticated supply and production capabilities, it will target strategic retail accounts that contribute to the broader acceptance of the brand and category. The Company believes these accounts will enable it to achieve broader distribution, opening new consumer segments and driving growth by increasing awareness, consideration, and purchase. The Company believes it is leading the way in the category by opening mass market channels that have historically been resistant to place CBD items on their shelves. Key to this success has been the relationships and partnerships with key natural accounts including: Thrive Market, Inc., Erewhon, Inc., Fresh Thyme Market, New Seasons Market LLC, Lassens Natural Foods & Vitamins, LLC, and Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. The Company has also shipped its products to national retail grocery and drug chains including The Kroger Co., Albertsons Companies, Inc., GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, Inc. Publix Super Markets, Inc., Petco Health and Wellness Company, Inc., and CVS Pharmacy, Inc.
The Company continues to sell its CBD CLINIC products into the practitioner market comprising chiropractors, acupuncturists, physical and massage therapists and continues to grow the total number of health care practitioners in the CBD CLINIC network. The market for the CBD CLINIC products can be characterized as a business-to-business ("B2B") market and is primarily served through national distributors. The Company currently works with over 10 national distributors to supply this market. The Company believes that it can continue to capture and increase its market share in this market by increasing its sales and marketing efforts targeted at this market.
Presently the Company holds the number one market share position across major retail channels including Total US Food/Drug/Mass retail aggregate, Total US Natural specialty retail, and e-commerce, based on market share data from Nielsen, SPINS, and Brightfield, respectively. Nielsen and Spins gather their data by tracking retail checkout systems that employ Universal Product Code (“UPC”) scanners. Brightfield tracks a variety of online market data specifically focused on the CBD and cannabis industries.
The Company’s sales are executed through customized strategies depending on the channel of sale. For example, in specialty food accounts, a combination of sales brokers and reps are strategically located within geographical 
markets. This provides proximity along with hands-on support at the store level to ensure products are correctly labeled and merchandised. This external sales team is managed by key management personnel within the Company. Depending on the size of the account, some locations are deemed to be “national accounts” that receive additional support from the Company’s internal national accounts team. This allows the Company’s brokers and independent sales teams to manage over 1,000 independent specialty food locations, while still achieving the same level of support that is expected in the Company’s larger chain retail customers.
Large retail customers are covered by the Company’s internal national accounts team with experts assigned to the accounts to develop the specific sales strategies necessary for the Company’s products to succeed in this market. Medical accounts such as doctors, chiropractic, holistic and integrative health groups are supported by distributors directly linked to the industry and managed by the Company’s internal sales team.
The Company utilizes e-commerce to reach consumers and guide them through the hemp and CBD buying process. This strategy allows access to consumers in the United States and has been instrumental in the Company’s success in growing the product line. The Company believes consumers (millennials through baby boomers) rely heavily on digital research. Key to this approach is the ability to access consumers organically who are searching the web for “CBD” or “Charlotte’s Web” both on the Company’s website as well as through linking from reliable providers of content and education. The Company’s website delivers on this through high levels of product purchase and engagement via opting into the Company’s email newsletter subscription. This indicates a higher level of interest in educational resources and product knowledge. The Company’s e-commerce database at the end of 2021 consisted of over 1,100,000 (up from 1.000,000 at year end 2020) “opting-in” email customers, with new enrollments averaging 20,600 customers per month.
The Company concentrates its activities in the digital space through:
•Search Engine Optimization — A collaborative, integrated effort with content and public relations teams optimizing search engine results in the category for those seeking both general education and availability to purchase
•Email — Growing the current subscriber list, working to develop segmentation processes and delivering relevant and personalized content
•Social — Leveraging the passion of the Company and its founders through a dynamic website and branding strategy which will be used to maintain the Company’s relevance among consumers
•Referral — Utilizing third-party influencers during marketing campaigns to amplify brand and product awareness – significant care has been taken to find users organically (prior to approaching) to ensure authentic and real testimonials of their own use
•Display Advertising — Developing display advertising strategy and integrating into 360° campaign planning via media buying capabilities
•Drive direct to “.com” — Optimizing the customers’ web experience to convert browsers into buyers and driving repeat purchases via the elimination of consumer friction points
Currently, the majority of orders are fulfilled through a Company-operated LOFT fulfillment center located in Louisville, Colorado. The Company is also using third-party logistics providers to secure a rapidly-scalable fulfillment and business continuity solution.
As public familiarity with hemp-derived CBD wellness products continues to increase, the Company may target several new distribution channels within the U.S. and certain international markets that have significant future expansion potential. Management believes there is a significant emerging opportunity to market premium hemp and botanical wellness products to the mainstream consumer marketplace. Management believes public 
recognition of the benefits of hemp products has increased dramatically in recent years, and consumers are seeking natural products for their general wellness benefits. Target markets include sports and recreation, holistic health and wellness, and healthy aging. Initial channel opportunities include vitamin and supplement retailers and natural grocers. Key retail partners will include major food, mass market accounts, general retail accounts, health care practitioners and specialty and natural channels.
Marketing and Promotion
The Company benefits from an authentic origination story linked to its first consumer served, Charlotte Figi. The story of how Charlotte’s mom, Paige Figi, desperately reached out to the Stanley Brothers seeking an alternative solution for her daughter’s wellness was captured and broadcasted in a CNN documentary by Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Charlotte’s rapid and significant improvement in her wellness ignited a movement for hemp legalization in the United States. Sadly, Charlotte passed away on April 7, 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the State of Colorado issued an executive order proclaiming April 7th Charlotte Figi Day in Colorado. Market data gathered from UPC-tracking and other indicators by leading third-party analysts such as Nielsen, SPINS, and Brightfield Group, shows that Charlotte’s Web is the market share leader in certain CBD categories and, the Company believes, the most widely recognized hemp extract with naturally occurring CBD in the world. Subsequently, the value of the Charlotte’s Web brand equity is a significant contributor to the value of the Company because it uniquely represents the founders’ story of establishing a mission-based company of giving back and providing high quality solutions for people to control their wellness journey.
Data collection and customer analysis from e-commerce sales continues to be a significant component of the Company’s marketing strategy. Direct-to-consumer e-commerce sales give an unprecedented opportunity to gain meaningful insight into how to better support the customer based on data including buying habits, purchase frequency, and in many cases, why the product is being used.
Consumer segmentation is being used to transform the Company’s consumer activities through both valuable understanding of the customer base, as well as the ability to activate and differentially invest in core consumer segments that will assist in developing the strongest lifetime value proposition for customers. Key elements of the segmentation include:
•driving ability to more effectively motivate trial orders, improve overall product trial experience, promote repeat purchasing patterns and ensure retention through targeted messaging;
•differentially investing in core segments to attract new users with a high likelihood of repeat conversion; and
•maximizing customization of email and other messaging channels to improve initial experiences and promote repeat buying.
The Company has a subscription program. Through its subscription program, the Company utilizes a discount structure to encourage enrollment with a similar structure to online “subscribe and save” models. This is expected to deliver upside demand and repeat purchases from existing customers by enabling scheduled reorders and improved continuity in consumption. Consumers are able to set their frequency for two-week, six-week or 1-3 monthly reorder patterns across the entire product line.
The Company continues to promote the awareness of its brands through investment in marketing programs, sponsorships and continued participation in events that offer wide exposure to both trade partners and consumer retail markets. For example, the Company entered into the Gronkowski Agreement and the Gillette Stadium and Patriot Place Agreement which have driven national brand awareness of the CBDMEDIC brand. In addition, CBDMEDIC is an Arthritis Foundation Impact Sponsor with the goal that the Company might serve as champions and active supporters in the Arthritis Foundation’s dedication to provide encouragement and assistance to the arthritis community.
As a Certified B Corp, the Company is a socially conscious company, and is committed to using business as a force for good and a catalyst for innovation. The Company weighs sound business decisions with consideration for how its efforts affect its employees, customers, the environment, and the communities where its employees live and where it does business, while maximizing profits and strengthening its brands. This social awareness includes contributions to non-profits, which are made on an ad hoc basis, concentrating first on those entities that have historically supported the business through education of existing and potential customers. The Company also supports non-profits that it believes can utilize the wellness aspects of its products (i.e., military veterans, adaptive athletes, educational organizations, etc.). Management believes that any socially oriented actions it takes will ultimately have a positive impact on the Company, its employees, and its Shareholders. The Company has historically donated and plans to continue to donate to charitable organizations.
Competition
The Company plans to invest significantly in strengthening the Charlotte’s Web brand in the global marketplace and solidifying the brand as “The World’s Most Trusted Hemp Extract™.” The Company is substantially vertically integrated from seed to packaged product, which helps ensure product quality. Being substantially vertically integrated and focusing on quality and standardization creates an important competitive differentiator for the Company, as the majority of its competitors are not substantially vertically integrated. The Company’s knowledge of hemp cultivation, combined with its scientific and financial resources, allow it to maintain a leading market position amongst its competitors.
The Company’s principal competitors in the CBD wellness products space include companies such as CV Sciences (PlusCBD), CBD MD, Medterra, Canopy Growth (Martha Stewart CBD) and Garden of Life.
Information Systems
The Company’s primary enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system is a cloud-based system well-known for manufacturing, shipping, and receiving, inventory control, supply chain management, sales, accounting, and finance. In addition to this centralized ERP system, supplemental peripheral software applications are used for specialized activities in finance, human resources, customer support, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing.
Intellectual Property
The Company’s intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to its business. In efforts to secure, maintain, and protect its intellectual and proprietary rights, the Company relies on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and other rights in the United States and Canada. The Company also has confidentiality and/or license agreements with certain employees, contractors and other third parties, which limit access to and use of the Company’s proprietary intellectual property.
Pursuant to an agreement (the “Name and Likeness Agreement”) entered into between the Company, CW and Leeland & Sig d/b/a Stanley Brothers Brand Company, a Colorado limited liability company owned by certain founders, including each of the Stanley Brothers (the “Stanley Brand Company”) effective August 1, 2018, and further amended on April 16, 2021, Stanley Brand Company grants the Company a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use the name “Stanley Brothers” and the likeness of the seven Stanley Brothers until July 31, 2022 on a royalty-free basis. Each party to the Name and Likeness Agreement will have the right to cause the other party to cease use of the name in certain circumstances such as misuse, bad acts, or a corporate acquisition. The initial term of the Name and Likeness Agreement was for a thirty-six (36) month period, with the Company agreeing to begin activities to cease all use of any intellectual property used under the Name and Likeness Agreement within thirty (30) days of expiration or termination thereof. In connection with the execution of the Name and Likeness Agreement, the Company executed employment agreements with each of the Stanley Brothers on September 1, 2018 providing for aggregate annual base salaries to the Stanley Brothers of $1,425,000. On April 16, 2021, pursuant to 
an amending agreement, the Name and Likeness and Agreement was extended for a period of one year, expiring July 31, 2022. In addition, the Company executed a consulting agreement which extended the service arrangements of the seven Stanley Brothers for a period of one year, expiring July 31, 2022. Upon execution of the consulting agreement, the Company paid $2,081,250 to Leeland & Sig LLC d/b/a Stanley Brothers Brand Company, on behalf of the Stanley Brothers, as consideration for the extended use of the “Stanley Brothers” name and the likeness of the seven Stanley Brothers, as well as consulting services to be provided to the Company over the term of the consulting agreement and certain restrictive covenants. See “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence – Company Transactions with Related Parties.” The Name and Likeness Agreement does not affect the Company’s intellectual property rights in connection with its use of “Charlotte’s Web.” See “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to the Company’s Business and Industry – Reliance on the Stanley Brothers brand could have negative consequences.”
The Company currently has a portfolio of pending U.S. plant, utility and design patent applications directed to CW’s most promising plant genetics, proprietary extraction technology, cannabinoid isolation methods and cannabinoid conversion processes and industrial designs. The Company also has pending U.S. and Canadian trademark applications.
On January 12, 2020, the Company announced that CW has been granted U.S. Utility Patents for its hemp genetics by the USPTO. The newly issued patents cover two of the Company’s new feminized seed hybrid hemp varieties developed under the Company’s breeding program; ‘Kirsche’ (US Patent No. 10,888,060) and ‘Lindorea’ (US Patent No. 10,888,059). ‘Lindorea’ and ‘Kirsche’ are the world’s first two allowed U.S. Utility Patents reading on feminized hybrid hemp plants.
The Company now has earned a total of four U.S. Utility Patents covering hemp varieties as it advances the science of hemp horticulture. The Company also has a Canadian Utility Patent Covering the 'CW1AS1" hemp variety.

Third-Party Suppliers, Service Providers and Distribution
Although the Company is substantially vertically integrated, the Company obtains certain input components, such as packaging components, flavors, and certain raw materials, from third-party suppliers. None of the third-party suppliers are considered to be material to the business on a standalone basis and all supply input components are readily available from other suppliers in the market.
If any given supplier or distributor is lost in a specific region, the Company believes these could be replaced without material disruption as it could contract with multiple alternative suppliers or distributors to provide the requisite service(s) and product(s). The Company is a substantially vertically integrated company that performs its own manufacturing for proprietary elements in the manufacturing process. The Company utilizes contract manufacturers for non-proprietary elements in its manufacturing process such as bottling and packaging.
The Company manages risks that are associated with third-party distributors, manufacturers and suppliers by identifying and qualifying alternative distributors, manufacturers and suppliers. The Company regularly assess its supply chain for threats to business continuity.
See “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to the Company’s Business and Industry – The Company relies on third-parties for the transportation of its hemp and hemp derived products, any delay or failure by these third-parties to meet the Company’s transport needs could impact the Company’s operations and financial performance; Supply chain issues, including significant price fluctuations or shortages of materials, and distribution challenges may increase the Company’s cost of goods sold and cause its results of operations and financial condition to suffer.”
Building Brand Awareness
Management believes the Charlotte’s Web brand is among the strongest in the hemp-derived CBD industry. Brand recognition will continue to be driven by several factors including: (i) media events similar to what has historically occurred with the Company including CNN, Today Show, the New York Times and Forbes; (ii) email, social media and blogs; (iii) use of subject matter experts; (iv) legislative participation; and (v) public speaking engagements at key industry events. In addition to these active outlets to build brand awareness, the Company plans to support word-of-mouth endorsements and testimonials from its customers who are advocates for its brands and products.
Growth from the Existing Product Portfolio Through Marketing Initiatives
The Company’s marketing mix strives to connect with audiences and the consumer journey through:
•paid and earned media to build awareness of the sector and the unique qualities of the Company’s brand equity and products
•search engine optimization ("SEO") and email marketing to drive consumer purchase and subscriptions on CW.com, the Company’s e-commerce platform
•public Relations campaigns to amplify targeted social and media marketing communications
•trade marketing to increase visibility and differentiation of our products in customer stores
•word of mouth and referrals from health care practitioners, their colleagues and patients
•event marketing and support of various social responsibility initiatives
•initiatives of the Stanley Brothers, the Company’s founders, under the Name and Likeness Agreement with the Company
International Expansion
The Company is exploring increased global distribution, including via e-commerce, in the future, with near-term expansion focused on the United Kingdom, European Union, Israel, and Canada. To achieve an international reach, the Company is exploring either partnering with distributors, brokers and/or manufacturers in these international locations or the Company may create its own foreign licensed subsidiaries to transact business in these regions. The Company will be constantly weighing the trade-off of each option against the impact on sales volume opportunities and profitability ratios in its decision-making process. Expansion into additional jurisdictions will be done in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements in such jurisdictions and the cost and complexity of such compliance will form part of the strategic evaluation process for any proposed expansion. 
On December 9, 2020, the Company announced that the Company signed the exclusive distribution agreement in Israel with Israel-based InterCure Ltd., which owns one of Israel’s largest and most established medical Cannabis producers, Canndoc. Its GMP-verified medical Cannabis products are sold in pharmacies in Israel, and it holds international cultivation and distribution agreements in the European Union. Selected Charlotte’s Web hemp extract wellness products are intended to be available to the Israeli public through AltCure, a subsidiary of InterCure Ltd. Charlotte’s Web and InterCure Ltd. also are considering future distribution agreements in certain European countries. The two companies will also explore opportunities such as clinical trials, product development and manufacturing in Israel.
On January 27, 2022 the Company named Jade Proudman, the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of Savage Cabbage, one of the oldest and most trusted CBD companies in the United Kingdom, as a Global Brand Ambassador for 
Charlotte's Web. As the founder and CEO of London-based Savage Cabbage, Jade Proudman has become one of the United Kingdom's leading CBD advocates, serving an established customer base of over 9,000 wellness seekers in over 44 countries around the world, recently expanding further within Europe. Savage Cabbage is a Member of EIHA ("European Industrial Hemp Association") and has been the official United Kingdom distributor of Charlotte's Web hemp CBD oil since 2016. Savage Cabbage has been an advocate of whole plant, full spectrum products that contain all the beneficial compounds that exist in the hemp plant as well as CBD. 
Improved Distribution
At the end of 2021, the Company’s products were sold in approximately 15,000 retail locations and over 8,000 health care practitioners across the U.S., as well as over one million addressable consumers on e-commerce. FDA / regulatory actions will increase distribution within the Food, Drug and Mass retail channels. However, the Company believes distribution gains in the U.S. are nevertheless achievable through:
•incremental retailer locations with existing customers
•increased consumer purchases in existing retail customer
•penetrating new Customer channels such as hospitality, sports, and travel
•increased traffic to and purchases via the Company’s e-commerce platform
Regulatory Framework
As a Cannabis-related business, the Company is subject to extensive regulation. The industry in which the Company operates is subject to regulation and control resulting from legislation enacted by the various levels of government. All applicable legislation is a matter of public record, and the Company is unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments governments may enact in the future. Changes to government regulation could impact the Company’s existing and planned operations or increase its operating expenses, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For additional details on the regulatory risks facing the Company, see “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to the Regulatory Environment.”
United States Regulatory Matters
General Overview
The following overview is subject to and qualified by the more detailed descriptions in the following sections entitled “United States Federal Regulation of Hemp”, “State Regulation of Hemp”, “FDA Regulation”, “Future Uncertainty of Legal Status” and “The Company’s Regulatory Compliance Activities in the United States”.
The Company does not produce or sell medicinal or recreational marijuana or products derived therefrom. It sells Hemp-based CBD products. While such products come from the same plant genus and species, Hemp and marijuana are legally distinct and are generally regulated, respectively, by three separate overarching bodies of law: the 2014 Farm Bill (which refers to section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014), the 2018 Farm Bill (which refers to the Agricultural Act of 2018) and the CSA (which refers to the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC § 801 et. seq.). Hemp, by legal definition, contains 0.3% THC or less on a dry weight basis, which is not considered to be a sufficient level to create an intoxicating effect like marijuana.
Consequently, the Company’s products are not sold pursuant to the rules and regulations governing the cultivation, transportation, and sale of medicinal or recreational marijuana. The Company cultivates, processes, transports, and sells its products pursuant to the 2014 Farm Bill and currently applicable provisions of the 2018 Farm Bill and in accordance with applicable state and local laws. All Hemp produced and sold by the Company constitutes Hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill as well as under the laws of the states in which the Company cultivates, manufactures, and 
sells such Hemp-based products. If sold internationally, products are sold in accordance with the laws of the importing and exporting jurisdiction.
Where products are sold internationally, the Company takes appropriate steps to assess local laws and regulations with a view to compliance. Not all jurisdictions have mature or fully developed Cannabis or Hemp regulatory regimes and the Company continuously monitors regulatory risk when conducting activities in local jurisdictions. Moreover, the regulatory regimes of certain jurisdictions may not differentiate between Hemp and recreational or medical marijuana. In particular, the Company’s products may be categorized or labelled as marijuana, medical marijuana, or a similar category notwithstanding that the product is, by U.S. standards, a hemp-based product.
The 2018 Farm Bill permanently removed hemp and its derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers from the purview of the CSA. Hemp is now deemed an agricultural commodity, and is no longer classified as a controlled substance, like marijuana. Furthermore, by defining Hemp to include its derivatives, extracts, and cannabinoids, Congress impliedly removed popular Hemp products, such as Hemp-derived CBD, from the purview of the CSA. Accordingly, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA") no longer has regulatory authority to interfere with the interstate commerce of Hemp products, so long as the THC level is at or below 0.3% on a dry weight basis. The 2018 Farm Bill also provides that state and Native American tribal governments may impose separate restrictions or requirements on hemp growth and the sale of Hemp products. However, they cannot interfere with the interstate transportation or shipment of lawfully produced Hemp or Hemp products. As a result of the 2018 Farm Bill, federal law now provides that CBD derived from Hemp is not a controlled substance under the CSA; however, states take varying approaches to regulating the production and sale of Hemp and Hemp-derived CBD. Some states, including recently California, explicitly authorize and regulate the production and sale of Hemp-derived CBD or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals to engage in commercial Hemp activities. Hemp cultivation is now permitted in all 50 states, but several states, including Missouri and Nebraska, do not expressly allow the sale of Hemp and Hemp-derived CBD. Additionally, a number of states prohibit the sale of ingestible CBD products based on the FDA’s position that, pursuant to the FD&C Act, it is unlawful to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are Hemp-derived.
The Company’s activities related to the production, marketing and sale of its products comply with the 2014 Farm Bill and/or 2018 Farm Bill, as currently applicable to its operations. However, certain government agencies (such as the FDA) and certain federal officials have challenged the scope of permissible commercial activity. FDA representatives, for example, have stated they believe that producers of some CBD-based products, including the Company, produce and sell their products in violation of the FD&C Act. Similarly, the Company’s marketing activities fall within the FDA’s jurisdiction, and in 2017, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to the Company for FD&C Act non-compliance, which the Company has responded to, in part to comply with the Warning Letter and in part to challenge FDA’s assertions in the letter. The Company has not received a response from the FDA and the Warning Letter remains open. While the FDA’s current position is that CBD cannot be marketed as a dietary supplement and is prohibited from use in food, the FDA is also currently evaluating whether, and how, Hemp-based CBD dietary supplements and food can be lawfully sold in the U.S. Over the past several years, FDA has issued numerous warning letters to companies marketing CBD products with disease or unlawful drug claims. The letters reiterate the agency’s position that CBD cannot be added to food and dietary supplements and targeted companies whose products violated the FD&C Act’s prohibition against: i) marketing CBD as or in a dietary supplement, human and animal food, or food additives; ii) marketing a dietary supplement, human and animal food, or cosmetic with disease or drug claims (i.e., claims suggesting that a product is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease); iii) including a substance in human or animal food when that substance is not GRAS; and iv) selling products that are misbranded due to their failure to include “adequate directions for use by a layperson”. The FDA’s enforcement against the sale and marketing of CBD products has to date been limited to the issuance of warning letters, although enforcement could include civil and criminal penalties. The legal status of CBD in food and dietary supplements is 
 Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (section 10113) (defining hemp under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, 7. U.S.C. 1621).
 The District of Columbia does not currently permit hemp cultivation.

under active consideration by the FDA as of the date of this Form 10-K, as indicated by the FDA’s January 2021 statement whereby the agency reaffirmed that it is actively evaluating the regulatory frameworks that apply to Cannabis-derived products intended for non-drug uses, and whether any new FDA regulations are warranted. While the Company disagrees with the position of the FDA, there is risk that this agency could take enforcement or regulatory actions against the Company.
Legal barriers applicable to, and risks associated with, selling Hemp and Hemp-derived CBD products result from a number of factors, including the fact that Hemp and marijuana are both derived from the Cannabis sativa L. plant, the rapidly changing patchwork of state laws governing Hemp and Hemp-derived CBD, and the FDA’s position that it is unlawful to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary supplements, i.e. the FDA’s position that CBD cannot be marketed in a dietary supplement on the basis that substantial clinical trials studying CBD as a new drug were made public prior to the marketing of any food or dietary supplement containing CBD, and therefore food or dietary supplements are precluded from containing this ingredient, referred to as the IND Preclusion. However, the removal of Hemp and its extracts, including CBD, from the CSA pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, and the FDA’s indication that it is considering using its authority to issue a regulation that could specifically allow Hemp-derived ingredients in foods and supplements, are major developments toward resolving these regulatory barriers. Stakeholders take different positions regarding the scope of legal activity in light of the interplay of federal and state law, and in light of recent developments, such as the 2018 Farm Bill, the September 30, 2017 decision of the World Anti-Doping Agency to drop CBD from its list of prohibited substances, and the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Drug Dependence review report finding that CBD is “generally well tolerated with a good safety profile” and low abuse potential.
Furthermore, on May 28, 2020, the FDA submitted draft guidance to the White House Office of Management and Budget relating to research considerations for Cannabis and Cannabis-derived compounds, which reflects the FDA’s continued steps to consider the safety and advancement of Cannabis-derived compounds. In a trade press article regarding this guidance, FDA confirmed that it is “working toward a goal of providing additional guidance and [has] made substantial progress,” while also reiterating the need to obtain additional data on the safety, effectiveness, and quality of CBD products. In addition, in July 2020 the FDA submitted a Cannabidiol Enforcement Policy Draft Guideline for Industry to the Office of Management and Budget. However, the FDA withdrew this guidance in January 2021 at the request of the Biden Administration. It has not yet indicated whether or when a new guidance document will be submitted.
Should the Company determine to sell products containing greater than 0.3% THC, additional regulatory regimes, both in the U.S. and internationally, will apply. However, at this time no such product has been developed by the Company.
The foregoing is an abbreviated overview of the Company’s position on the legality of the Company’s operations in the United States. Additional background and a more thorough analysis of applicable U.S. and international regulatory regimes are set out in greater detail below.
United States Federal Regulation of Hemp
Development of Current Regulatory Framework
Summary
In addition to customary regulations applicable to any commercial business, the Company’s operations are subject to state and federal regulation in respect of the cultivation of Hemp and the production, distribution and sale of products intended for human ingestion or topical application and, with respect to certain products, by animals.

Hemp is an agricultural commodity cultivated for use in the production of a wide range of products globally. Among others, Hemp is used in the agriculture, textile, recycling, automotive, furniture, food and beverage, paper, construction materials and personal care industries.
Botanically, hemp is categorized as Cannabis sativa L., a subspecies of the Cannabis genus. Numerous unique, chemical compounds are extractable from hemp, including THC and CBD. These cannabinoids are responsible for a range of potential psychological and physiological effects. Hemp, as defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, is distinguishable from marijuana, which also comes from the Cannabis sativa L. subspecies, by its absence of more than trace amounts (0.3% or less) of the psychoactive compound THC. Although international standards vary, other countries, such as Canada, have used the same THC potency standards to define hemp. Hemp was widely grown in the U.S. as an agricultural commodity from the colonial period into the early 1900s and was commonly used in the manufacture of paper, fabrics, and other products. By 1970, however, the CSA explicitly prohibited the cultivation of any variety of Cannabis without a DEA permit.
Per the plain language of the CSA, only certain parts of the Cannabis plant (generally, what was historically considered to be the psychoactive portions of the plant) are controlled and defined as marijuana, while other parts of the Cannabis plant (now inclusive of hemp) are exempted from CSA control. Consumer goods containing hemp seeds or “hemp hearts,” for example, have long been lawfully imported into the U.S. and legally sold in commerce due to the fact that the sterilized seeds are clearly exempt from the definition of marijuana under the CSA and are not otherwise controlled substances. Nonetheless, from the enactment of the CSA until the passage of the 2014 Farm Bill, cultivating hemp for any purpose in the U.S. without a DEA registration was federally illegal. The 2014 Farm Bill loosened the federal prohibition on the domestic production of hemp, by allowing hemp to be cultivated within the context of an agricultural pilot program and where permitted by state law. On December 20, 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill became law, and, on December 31, 2021, the 2014 Farm Bill and hemp programs authorized under this legislation expired. Unlike the 2014 Farm Bill, which did not amend the CSA but only preempted from CSA control certain specified activities, the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly amended the CSA to exclude from the definition of marijuana all parts of the Cannabis plant (including its derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not) containing a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis, and excluded from the CSA definition of “tetrahydrocannabinol” any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that falls within the definition of Hemp. As a result, Hemp is no longer classified as a controlled substance, like marijuana. By defining Hemp to include its derivatives, extracts, and cannabinoids, Congress impliedly removed popular Hemp products, such as Hemp-derived CBD, from the purview of the CSA. Accordingly, the DEA no longer has regulatory authority to interfere with the interstate commerce of Hemp products. The 2018 Farm Bill also allows farmers to access crop insurance and fully participate in USDA programs for certification and competitive grants. State and tribal governments may impose separate restrictions or requirements on Hemp production, but they cannot interfere with the interstate transport of lawfully produced Hemp or Hemp products.
The 2014 Farm Bill
In 2014, Congress enacted the 2014 Farm Bill. The 2014 Farm Bill, the provisions of which expired as of December 31, 2021, authorized institutions of higher education and state departments of agriculture (and their contractual designees) to cultivate hemp, notwithstanding the CSA or any other federal law, provided that certain conditions are met. The scope of the 2014 Farm Bill was limited to cultivation that was: (a) for research purposes (inclusive of market research, which multiple federal agencies have confirmed includes commercial sales with a research purpose); (b) part of an “agricultural pilot program” or other agricultural or academic research; and (c) permitted by state law. Many states that adopted pilot programs under the 2014 Farm Bill have since replaced them with approved programs under the 2018 Farm Bill, described below. The various state Hemp programs had different requirements regarding the registration of cultivators and processors, the involvement of institutions of higher education, and

permissible commercialization.8 Activities determined to be compliant with the 2014 Farm Bill were protected from federal interference by successive Consolidated Appropriations Acts enacted during the years 2015 through 2021. The Consolidated Appropriations Acts generally prohibited the federal government’s use of funds in contravention of the 2014 Farm Bill and specifically prohibited such federal interference with regard to the “transportation, processing, sale, or use of . . . hemp, or seeds of such plant, that is grown or cultivated in accordance with the [2014 Farm Bill], within or outside the [s]tate in which the . . . hemp is grown or cultivated.” Rather than distinguishing between “hemp” and “marijuana” based on the part of the plant from which a product is derived, the 2014 Farm Bill definition included all parts of the Cannabis plant, and distinguished hemp from marijuana on the basis of the concentration of THC. Any plants that exceeded the 0.3% THC limitation were considered marijuana (a Schedule I controlled substance), and thus were not compliant with the 2014 Farm Bill. Activities determined to be outside the scope of the 2014 Farm Bill were not protected by the Appropriations Rider and were subject to federal enforcement action. Notwithstanding the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill and the publication of the interim final rule dated October 31, 2019 issued by the USDA in respect of commercial production of Hemp in the United States ("USDA IFR"), the hemp cultivation and research provisions contained in the 2014 Farm Bill remained in effect until December 31, 2021. Many states relied on their existing pilot program regimes—either in choosing to continue operating under the 2014 Farm Bill until its expiration or in submitting a 2018 Farm Bill plan to assume primary regulatory authority over Hemp production. Because the 2018 Farm Bill permits states and Native American tribes to regulate Hemp and Hemp-derived products more restrictively than the 2014 Farm Bill, variances in these jurisdictions’ laws and regulations on Hemp may to persist. Compliance with state law remains imperative under the 2018 Farm Bill.
FDA Approval of Epidiolex
On June 25, 2018, the FDA issued to GW Pharmaceuticals plc its approval for Epidiolex, the first Cannabis-derived prescription medicine to be available in the U.S. The active ingredient in Epidiolex is CBD isolate created from Marijuana-based plants.
The 2018 Farm Bill
The 2018 Farm Bill became law on December 20, 2018. Prior to this law, all non-exempt Cannabis plants grown in the United States were scheduled as a controlled substance under the CSA, and as a result, the cultivation of hemp for any purpose in the United States without a Schedule I registration with the DEA was, unless exempted by the 2014 Farm Bill, illegal under federal law. The passage of the 2018 Farm Bill materially changed federal laws governing Hemp by removing hemp from the CSA and establishing a federal regulatory framework for hemp cultivation. Specifically, the 2018 Farm Bill: (a) explicitly amended the CSA to exclude from the definition of marijuana all parts of the Cannabis plant (including its derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not) containing a THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis; (b) allows the commercial production and sale of Hemp in interstate commerce; (c) establishes the USDA as the primary federal agency regulating the cultivation of hemp in the United States, while allowing states to adopt their own plans to regulate the same; and (d) affords farmers the opportunity to obtain crop insurance and research grants. The 2018 Farm Bill also excluded from the CSA definition of “tetrahydrocannabinol” any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that falls within the definition of hemp. By defining Hemp to include its derivatives, extracts, and cannabinoids, popular Hemp products, such as Hemp-derived CBD, are no longer subject to DEA control. Accordingly, the DEA no longer has regulatory authority to interfere with the interstate commerce of Hemp products, so long as the THC level of such products is at or below 0.3%.
Although the DEA no longer regulates Hemp, marijuana continues to be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. As a result, CBD and other cannabinoids, if derived from marijuana as defined by the CSA, also remain Schedule I controlled substances under U.S. federal law. Though chemically and genetically distinct, hemp and marijuana appear similar to the naked eye. The active enforcement against illegal marijuana and marijuana- based products under current federal law may inadvertently result in enforcement actions taken against hemp or Hemp-derived products.
8 Id.
The 2018 Farm Bill amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to categorize hemp as an agricultural commodity under the regulatory purview of the USDA in coordination with state departments of agriculture. Although the USDA will be the primary federal regulatory agency overseeing hemp cultivation in the United States, states, U.S. territories, and Indian tribes desiring to obtain (or retain) primary regulatory authority over Hemp activities within their borders are allowed to do so after submitting a plan for regulation to the USDA, and receiving approval from the USDA for the same. Pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, states, U.S. territories, and tribal governments can adopt their own regulatory plans for hemp cultivation, even if more restrictive than federal regulations, so long as the plans meet minimum federal standards and are approved by the USDA. Hemp cultivation in states and tribal territories that do not choose to submit their own plans (and that do not prohibit hemp cultivation) will be governed by USDA regulation.
On January 19, 2021, the USDA released the USDA Final Rule (“USDA FR”), which governs the domestic production of hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill. The USDA FR also specifies the provisions that a state or tribal Hemp plan must contain to be in compliance with the 2018 Farm Bill. Once USDA formally receives a plan, the agency will have 60 days to review and approve or disapprove the plan. To date, the USDA has approved over 90 state and tribal hemp production plans. The status of the USDA's review of plans, is available at https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/hemp/state-and-tribal-plan-review.
As introduced above, state and tribal governments may impose separate restrictions or requirements on hemp cultivation and the sale of Hemp products; however, states may not interfere with the interstate transportation or shipment of lawfully produced Hemp or Hemp products. This was confirmed in a May 2019 memorandum released by the USDA’s Office of General Counsel. That memorandum reiterates that, due to enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill, states and Native American tribes may not prohibit the interstate transportation or shipment of hemp lawfully produced under the 2014 or 2018 Farm Bills.
It is important to note that the 2018 Farm Bill preserves the authority and jurisdiction of the FDA, under the FD&C Act, to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and sale of food, drugs, dietary supplements, and cosmetics, including products that contain Hemp extracts and derivatives, such as CBD. As a result, the FD&C Act will continue to apply to Hemp-derived food, drugs, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and devices introduced, or prepared for introduction, into interstate commerce. As a producer and marketer of Hemp-derived products, the Company must comply with the FDA regulations applicable to manufacturing and marketing of FDA-regulated products. See “FDA Regulation”, below.
On March 5, 2020, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen M. Hahn issued a statement on the FDA’s work related to CBD products. The statement makes clear that the FDA will continue its work to educate the public on CBD’s perceived safety risks and that the FDA is taking steps to solicit additional public feedback, data, and research on the science, safety, and quality of CBD products. These new steps include re-opening the public docket so that FDA can obtain additional scientific data on CBD, which will include a process by which confidential and proprietary information can be shared with the FDA and kept protected. Additionally, former Commissioner Hahn’s statement reiterates that the FDA will continue to monitor and police the CBD products marketplace and is evaluating the issuance of a risk-based enforcement policy that provides greater transparency and clarity regarding factors the FDA intends to consider in prioritizing enforcement decisions.
Much of former Commissioner’s Hahn statement was also included in the FDA’s congressionally mandated report on CBD, which was also submitted on March 5, 2020. The report confirms that the FDA is actively considering pathways to allow the marketing of CBD as a dietary supplement, which may include notice and-comment rulemaking and interim risk-based enforcement policies. The report signals the FDA’s continued interest in certain aspects of CBD, including effects from sustained use, effects from different methods of exposure, and effects on the developing brain and on the unborn child and breastfed newborn. The report also acknowledges that the FDA is receiving inquiries about whether “full spectrum” and “broad spectrum” Hemp products can currently be marketed and sold pursuant to the Farm Bill. The FDA’s current position is that products containing CBD cannot be marketed 
as a dietary supplement. The report does not set a timeline for agency action, but it does signal the FDA’s clear interest in a pathway for the use of CBD in dietary supplements, despite its current position on CBD. Further to this point, former Commissioner Hahn had publicly stated that it would be a “fool’s game” for the FDA to pull CBD products from the market entirely, as their use is already widespread.
In January 2021, the FDA issued an update entitled “Better Data for a Better Understanding of the Use and Safety Profile of Cannabidiol (CBD) Products.” In the statement, the FDA acknowledges the rapid increase and interest in the availability of CBD and other products derived from Cannabis, and calls for “real-world data” on the use and safety of CBD. The call acknowledges the FDA’s current gaps in understanding of the safety profile of CBD, which may be addressed through obtaining real-world data and a robust evidentiary foundation to inform public health decisions regarding CBD. The FDA further notes that it is continuing to “evaluate the regulatory frameworks that apply to certain Cannabis-derived products that are intended for non-drug uses, including whether any new FDA regulations may be warranted.” However, it is unclear whether the new FDA Commissioner, Dr. Robert Califf will take the same stance on CBD as former Commissioners Hahn and Gottlieb.
On March 22, 2021, the FDA issued a news release announcing the issuance of warning letters to two companies for selling OTC products labeled as containing CBD, alleging that the products are illegally marketed unapproved drugs and misbranded due to prominent featuring of CBD on the labeling. A similar warning was issued to another online CBD retailer on July 22, 2021.
On October 16, 2021, the FDA published a “Cannabis-Derived Products Data Acceleration Plan,” a portfolio of pilot initiatives and partnerships designed to leverage novel data sources and advanced data analytics to identify current and emerging safety vulnerabilities in the cannabis-derived products market. Through the Data Acceleration Plan, FDA seeks to gather, in real time, information about potential safety problems or adverse events associated with cannabis-derived products, including CBD products, and information about general patterns of product use and emerging trends. According to FDA, “new approaches to detecting safety signals and other insights using diverse data sources and rigorous analytical methods can contribute significantly to FDA’s ability to respond to emerging and rapidly evolving product areas, like the [cannabis-derived products] market.” Sample pilot projects that are part of the Data Acceleration Plan take advantage of the information already available online, from certificates of analysis, to customer reviews and adverse event surveillance systems to detect safety signals and gaps in understanding needing to be filled by FDA- and industry-driven studies. FDA also plans to partner with other federal agencies, international regulatory bodies, and state-based regulatory organizations to gather additional data and develop its regulatory strategy. While the Data Acceleration Plan does not guarantee that the agency will create a pathway for it to approve CBD to be incorporated into food and dietary supplements, it indicates that the FDA is focused on modernizing and enhancing its ability to evaluate the CBD and other cannabinoid markets.
In addition, on December 17, 2020, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") announced enforcement proceedings against six companies making deceptive marketing claims related to CBD products. The companies allegedly made a range of scientifically unsupported claims about the products’ ability to treat serious health conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. On March 5, 2021, the FTC approved consent orders against the six companies that prohibit future deceptive conduct, with monetary penalties imposed on five of the six the companies. On July 6, 2021, the FTC announced the approval of a seventh administrative consent order against a CBD company, also for unsupported health claims.

DEA IFR
On August 21, 2020, the DEA issued an interim final rule (the “DEA IFR”) concerning implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill. Even though the 2018 Farm Bill removed Hemp from scheduling under the CSA, the DEA IFR purports to clarify that material that exceeds 0.3% delta-9 THC remains controlled in Schedule I of the CSA. Additionally, the DEA IFR states that the 2018 Farm Bill does not impact the control status of synthetically derived THCs, for which the DEA claims that the amount of delta-9 THC is not a determining factor in whether the material is a controlled substance.
The DEA IFR has caused consternation throughout the Hemp industry because of concerns that it confuses the legality of in-process Hemp extract material that may temporarily and unintentionally exceed 0.3% delta-9 (before returning to or below 0.3% delta-9 THC in finished form). However, DEA spokesperson Sean Mitchell has indicated that the DEA is aware of the Hemp industry’s policy concerns and “has higher enforcement priorities, such as opioids and methamphetamine.” Moreover, more than 3,300 public comments were submitted in response to the interim rule, so it is possible that the DEA IFR will be modified and improved before becoming a final rule. Many of the comments, which were submitted by stakeholders and industry groups make clear that the DEA IFR is inconsistent with the 2018 Farm Bill and would create serious challenges for the hemp products industry. Further, in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Congress included report language that directed the USDA to develop regulations to protect the transportation, sale, and storage of in-process Hemp extract. There is also a chance that the DEA IFR will be invalidated in its entirety. It is currently the subject of at least one federal lawsuit, which could result in the DEA IFR being struck down. In the Company’s opinion, the DEA IFR is improper and unconstitutional, and the Company’s products enjoy all of the protections of the 2018 Farm Bill and are not impacted by the DEA IFR.
On February 8, 2022, Representative Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) introduced the Hemp Advancement Act of 2022 to improve the 2018 Farm Bill’s hemp provisions and provide greater clarity and flexibility to hemp growers and processors.12 Specifically, the bill would: (1) raise the allowable THC threshold for hemp and in-process hemp extract to make the rules more workable for growers and processors, while ensuring that final hemp products sold to consumers are not intoxicating through a 0.3% limits of total THCs in products, and (2) remove the requirement that hemp testing occur in DEA-registered laboratories, among other updates to aimed at providing protections for the hemp industry.
H.R. 841 and S. 1698
On February 4, 2021, Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-OR-5) and Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA-9) introduced H.R. 841 for the second time. It would ensure that Hemp-derived CBD, and other non-intoxicating Hemp-derived compounds, could be lawfully marketed as dietary supplements. The bill would require CBD and Hemp extract product manufacturers to comply with the existing regulatory framework for dietary supplements, to help assure that such products are safe, properly labeled, and manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices and other health and safety provisions of the FD&C Act. Passage would also help stabilize the Hemp markets, open up a promising economic opportunity for U.S. agriculture, and fulfill the commitments made to Hemp farmers pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill. Prospects for such passage are improved by the fact that the prior version of H.R. 841, introduced during the 116th Congress (2019-2020), won the bipartisan support of 30 co-sponsors and was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. However, the bill failed to win passage prior to the congressional session ending.
On May 19, 2021, Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Rand Paul (R-KY) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced S. 1698, the Hemp Access and Consumer Safety Act. The bill would allow the use of CBD and other hemp-derived ingredients in both dietary supplements and food and beverage products. It also provides FDA with the authority to establish labeling and packaging requirements for supplements and foods that contain hemp, hemp-derived CBD, or other hemp ingredients, and would permit FDA to take additional enforcement action against supplements that do

not meet the FD&C Act’s definition of “dietary supplement.” Prospects for the passage of H.R. 841 and S. 1698 are unclear.
In addition, on July 14, 2021, Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) released a discussion draft of the “Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act” (CAOA). The bill removes marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and establishes a federal regulatory framework for adult-use Cannabis products. “Hemp” as defined by the 2018 Farm Bill would be excluded from the bill’s definition of “cannabis.” However, the CAOA also contains provisions to regulate hemp-derived CBD as a dietary supplement, provided certain requirements are met. Among other things, the language would: require submission of NDI notifications for supplements that contain CBD; authorize FDA to set a recommended daily serving limit for CBD and labeling/packaging requirements for CBD-containing supplements, both of which may be established through an interim final rule instead of traditional notice-and-comment procedures. The legislation also provides FDA with additional enforcement authority for dietary supplements, which the agency believes is necessary to address issues such as synthetic CBD. To date, the bill has not been formally introduced, and its prospects are uncertain.
On November 15, 2021, Congresswoman Nancy Mace (R-SC) introduced the H.R. 5977, the “States Reform Act,” another comprehensive cannabis reform bill seeking to legalize and regulate marijuana at the federal level. The States Reform Act would deem cannabis and industrial hemp as having been marketed in the United States as dietary ingredients before October 15, 1994, and would also deem them generally recognized as safe based on common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Thus, under the States Reform Act, FDA would be prohibited from applying the dietary supplement and food additive preclusions to cannabis and industrial hemp. As of the date of this Form 10-K, the States Reform Act has four Republican co-sponsors, and the backing of several industry advocacy groups. H.R. 5977’s prospects of passage are unclear.
On December 2, 2021, Representative Kathleen Rice (D-NY), plus cosponsors Representatives Morgan Griffith (R-VA), Angie Craig (D-MN), and Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) introduced H.R. 6134, the “CBD Product Safety and Standardization Act of 2021.” This proposal pertains specifically to food and beverages containing CBD, and would allow FDA to regulate CBD in food as it would any other food ingredient. It would also require FDA to establish regulations specifying the maximum amount of hemp-derived CBD a food or beverage may have per serving; labeling and packaging requirements; and conditions of intended use for the product. H.R. 6134’s chances of passage are unclear.
State Regulation of Hemp in the United States
At present, the Company sources its Hemp only from proprietary operations and contract suppliers located in Colorado, Kentucky and Oregon that are in compliance with state and federal regulations. However, the Company is aware of variations in certain states’ definition of Hemp as compared with the definition of Hemp in the 2018 Farm Bill, although the majority of states have aligned their definition of Hemp with the federal definition. All Hemp produced and sold by the Company constitutes Hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill and under the laws of the states in which it produces and sells such Hemp.
Under the 2018 Farm Bill, states retain significant discretion and authority to adopt their own regulatory regimes governing hemp production. As a result, regulation of Hemp and the products derived therefrom will likely continue to vary on a state-by-state basis even though the 2018 Farm Bill has been fully implemented. In addition, states take varying approaches to regulating the production and sale of hemp-derived CBD. While all states have removed lawfully produced hemp from their controlled substance laws, only certain states explicitly authorize and regulate the sale of hemp-derived CBD products, or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals to engage in commercial hemp activities. For example, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Florida, Colorado, and other states have passed laws that explicitly exempt hemp extracts such as CBD from legal prohibitions applicable to controlled substances such as marijuana. In other states, the sale of CBD, notwithstanding its origin, may be explicitly authorized only under state medical or adult-use marijuana program licensees. Additionally, a number of states prohibit the sale of ingestible CBD products based on FDA’s position that, pursuant to the FD&C Act, it is unlawful 
to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. Since the Company’s products are specifically excepted from the CSA by the 2018 Farm Bill’s definition of Hemp, it is the Company’s position that such state laws would specifically except them as well.
The treatment of the legality of Hemp-derived CBD products by state and local law enforcement authorities is broadly disparate. These products have been sold at retail and online in all fifty states for many years, and law enforcement actions have been limited and, in some cases, discontinued after initial enforcement actions.
Accordingly, the sale of CBD at the retail level in some U.S. states remains a gray and evolving area of the law. An increasing number of states – including California, Hawaii, Florida, Kentucky, Iowa, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia – have passed legislation that explicitly permit the sale of CBD. Several of these states also place additional requirements on the sale of CBD products such as specific testing, labeling, or registration of products. The Company has chosen to sell its products in all fifty states, understanding that there is a risk of state or local law enforcement or regulatory action, and that state-specific requirements may vary significantly. Moreover, the Company has limited access to information regarding or control over which states its products may transit through between production and sale.
Colorado is the only jurisdiction in which the Company directly cultivates Hemp. The Company has obtained the following licenses issued by the Colorado Department of Agriculture: (i) Registration issued April 3, 2021 in respect of Indoor Commercial Industrial Hemp Registration — 3,000 sq. ft.; (ii) Registration issued March 22, 2021 in respect of Indoor Commercial Industrial Hemp Registration — 18,600 sq. ft.; (iii) Registration issued February 3, 2021 in respect of Outdoor Commercial Industrial Hemp Registration — 120 acres; (iv) Registration issued February 12, 2021 in respect of Outdoor Commercial Industrial Hemp Registration — 1 acre and 11,200 sq. ft. The foregoing licenses are in respect of cultivation only as a license from the state of Colorado is not required for the subsequent sale of its products.
The Company’s cultivation division has increased its focus on research, while continuing operations in Colorado, Oregon and Kentucky, to further its competitive advantage in optimizing regional genetics and developing the Company’s scalable drying and harvesting systems.
The varying regulations with respect to the treatment of Hemp from state to state continue to evolve. The regulations of the particular states most impactful to the Company’s business are described below.
Colorado
The bulk of the Company’s operations are based in Colorado as a result of the state’s legalization of Hemp and mature regulatory program.
Passed in 2012, Amendment 64 to the Colorado Constitution directed the General Assembly to enact legislation governing the cultivation, processing and sale of Hemp by July 1, 2014. In 2013, responsibility for establishing regulations pertaining to the cultivation of Hemp, including registration and inspection, was delegated to the Colorado Department of Agriculture ("CDA"). The CDA adopted rules and regulations that set forth requirements for registration, inspection, and testing. Registration requirements include but are not limited to: disclosing the name and address of the entity that will hold the registration, and the name of each officer, director, member, partner or owner of at least 10% of the entity and any other person who has managing or controlling authority over the entity; providing the CDA with GPS coordinates and a map of the land area where the Hemp will be cultivated; 
 Colo. Const. art. XVIII, § 16.
 8 CCR 1203-23.
 Id.

listing the intended use of harvested Hemp materials; and payment of a non-refundable fee. All registrants are subject to routine inspection and sampling by the CDA to verify that the THC concentration of the plants being cultivated does not exceed 0.3% on a dry weight basis, and to ensure registrants are complying with applicable reporting requirements. Reporting requirements include a pre-planting report detailing the varieties to be planted, a planting report specifying the exact land areas where planting occurred, and a harvest report documenting the size of the harvest and the anticipated harvest date.
After the passage of the 2014 Farm Bill, the Colorado legislature passed the Colorado Industrial Hemp Regulatory Program Act establishing the Colorado Industrial Hemp Regulatory Program. The Colorado Industrial Hemp Regulatory Program Act expressly authorizes two distinct categories of hemp cultivation registration to be issued and administered by the CDA: (i) R&D; and (ii) commercial. “Research and Development” is defined as the “cultivation of Hemp by an institution of higher education or other entity approved by the [CDA] for purposes of agricultural or academic research in the development of growing Hemp.” In comparison, “Commercial” is defined as “the growth of Hemp, for any purpose including engaging in commerce, market development and market research, by any person or legal entity other than an institution of higher education or under the pilot program administered by the [CDA] for purposes of agricultural or academic research in the development of growing Hemp.”
The Company believes that cultivation registrations for R&D purposes that operate in compliance with CDA rules and regulations comply with the conditions of the 2014 Farm Bill and the 2018 Farm Bill, and cultivation registrations for commercial purposes operating in compliance with CDA rules and regulations comply with the 2014 Farm Bill and the 2018 Farm Bill.
Finally, on May 30, 2018, the governor of Colorado signed House Bill 18-1295 into law. This legislation modified the Colorado Food and Drug Act to establish that food, cosmetics, drugs, and devices, as those terms are defined in the act, are not adulterated or misbranded by virtue of containing Hemp. This law codified a policy established in 2017 by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment ("CDPHE") that allowed for the production and sale of food products containing Hemp, so long as certain express conditions were satisfied. Under applicable legislation, food products containing Hemp must be produced by a wholesale food manufacturing facility that has registered with the CDPHE, and the finished product must contain a delta-9 THC concentration of no more than three-tenths of one percent (0.3%).
Following the implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill through the USDA FR, Colorado continued to operate its 2014 Farm Bill pilot program in 2021. On August 10, 2021, the USDA approved CDA’s State Hemp Management Plan, which became effective January 1, 2022. In addition, in February 2021 CDPHE adopted revised regulations concerning Hemp products, effective April 14, 2021, that establish new manufacturing, testing, and labeling requirements for Hemp products.
Kentucky
Kentucky established a robust agricultural pilot program in 2013, which it expanded in 2017. Program participants may grow, cultivate, handle, process or market Hemp and Hemp products. The Kentucky Department of Agriculture

has promulgated regulations and issued a policy guide for the program, both of which have served as models for newer Hemp regimes in other states.
Kentucky adopts the definition of “Hemp” set forth under the 2018 Farm Bill. Kentucky’s definition of marijuana excludes lawful Hemp and Hemp products.
Kentucky’s definition of marijuana specifically exempts Hemp products that do not contain any living plants, viable seeds, leaf materials or floral materials, as well as CBD products derived from hemp.
Following the implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill through the USDA FR, Kentucky continued to operate its 2014 Farm Bill pilot program in 2021. Kentucky’s State Plan was submitted to FDA on September 15, 2021. The State Plan has been approved by USDA and became effective January 1, 2022.
While the Company itself is not a program participant, it does take steps to ensure that the Kentucky-based suppliers with which it contracts are participants in the Kentucky agricultural pilot program, including requiring suppliers to represent and warrant their compliance with Kentucky law in writing and obtaining a copy of the applicable License issued to such supplier.
Oregon
Oregon’s Hemp laws are also evolving. Hemp extracts and CBD are referred to or defined in Oregon’s Hemp statutes and the state’s hemp regulations, pursuant to which an “industrial hemp commodities or product” includes CBD and other compounds derived from hemp. Further, all cannabinoid products from hemp must be tested for their THC and CBD content and microbiological contaminants. Only a grower registered with Oregon Department of Agriculture (the “ODA”) may produce Hemp, and only a handler registered with the ODA may process Hemp. A separate registration is required to handle Hemp seed. There are further restrictions on who a Hemp registrant can sell to and the Company’s packaged goods must comply with Oregon’s THC, CBD and microbiological testing requirements. In addition, Oregon restricts the sale of hemp products with 0.5 milligrams or more total THC per package to those age 21 and older.
Following the implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill through the USDA FR, Oregon continued to operate its 2014 Farm Bill pilot program in 2021. On October 1, 2021, the ODA submitted a draft hemp plan to USDA for approval, and the plan was approved on January 6, 2022.
While the Company itself is not registered in Oregon, it does take steps to ensure the Oregon-based suppliers with which it contracts are appropriately registered with the ODA, including requiring suppliers to represent and warrant such compliance in writing and obtaining a copy of the applicable License issued to such supplier.
FDA Regulation
The governing food and drug law in the United States is the FD&C Act. One purpose of the FD&C Act is to forbid the movement in interstate commerce of adulterated and misbranded food, drugs, devices and cosmetics.  The FDA

is responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices; and by ensuring the safety of the nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. The FD&C Act prohibits the use in a food or dietary supplement of an ingredient that has already been approved as a new drug, or an article authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and made public. To date, the FDA has approved one product containing CBD as a drug, and continues to take the position that CBD cannot be marketed as a dietary supplement or added to food because a product containing CBD was approved as a drug and substantial clinical trials studying CBD as a new drug were made public prior to the marketing of any food or dietary supplements containing CBD, and therefore dietary supplements or food are precluded from containing this ingredient. While the Company disagrees with the FDA's position, this creates additional barriers to selling certain CBD and CBD-based products in the U.S.
Notably, the FDA does not impose the same restrictions on the use of CBD in cosmetic products. The agency states on its website that “[c]ertain cosmetic ingredients are prohibited or restricted by regulation, but currently that is not the case for any cannabis or cannabis-derived ingredients.” However the FDA further notes that such products must comply with all applicable legal requirements including the adulteration and misbranding provisions of the FD&C Act specific to cosmetic products.
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (the “DSHEA”), an amendment to the federal FD&C Act, established a framework governing the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing, and marketing of dietary supplements in the United States. Generally, under DSHEA, dietary ingredients marketed in the United States prior to October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. “New” dietary ingredients (i.e. dietary ingredients “not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994”) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” and is not “chemically altered.” Any NDI notification must provide the FDA with evidence of a “history of use or other evidence of safety” establishing that use of the dietary ingredient ”will reasonably be expected to be safe.”
As noted above, the FDA has taken the position that CBD cannot be marketed as a dietary supplement because it has been the subject of investigation as a new drug (referred to as “IND Preclusion”). According to the FDA, the submission of the IND for Epidiolex and Sativex by Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of London-based GW Pharmaceuticals, preceded the sales and marketing of CBD as a dietary supplement. Excluded from the DSHEA definition of a dietary supplement is: “an article authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biological for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, which was not before such approval, certification, licensing, or authorization marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food unless the Secretary, in the Secretary’s discretion, has issued a regulation, after notice and comment, finding that the article would be lawful under this Act.” It is the FDA’s interpretation of the IND Preclusion that the preclusion date is the date in which it authorized the drug for investigation; however, the Company believes there are significant arguments against this position in that all conditions of the statute must be met before the IND Preclusion applies, including (1) authorization for investigation as a new drug; (2) substantial clinical investigations must be instituted; (3) such substantial investigations must be made public; and (4) all of the above must occur prior to the marketing of the article as a food or dietary supplement. 
On July 23, 2021 the Company was advised by the FDA of its objection to a New Dietary Ingredient Notification (“NDIN”) submitted by the Company earlier in 2021. The FD&C Act requires that manufacturers who wish to market dietary supplements that contain "new dietary ingredients" ("NDI") notify the FDA with their basis for concluding that the NDI is reasonably expected to be safe under the conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling. The Company’s submission was objected to on the basis that its CBD containing a full spectrum hemp

extract does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement due to the IND Preclusion and insufficient safety data. The Company does not agree with a number of conclusions reached by the FDA, in particular with respect to their analysis of safety data provided. While the objection has not impacted the Company’s existing business, the Company will continue to engage with the FDA and lawmakers with the objective of securing a favorable ruling and/or facilitating the promulgation of definitive legislation establishing an appropriate regulatory environment to protect consumers and to establish guidance for manufacturers.
The CBD CLINIC, CBDMEDIC, and HARMONY HEMP brands include products that are OTC drug products regulated by the FDA. To legally market an OTC drug product, the FD&C Act and FDA regulations promulgated under its authority require FDA approval of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) that includes substantial evidence of effectiveness based on adequate and well-controlled studies, or an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”). Alternatively, an OTC drug product may be marketed without an FDA approved NDA or ANDA if the drug product is manufactured in compliance with an OTC drug regulation, referred to as a monograph, which has been established for that therapeutic class of drug. The OTC drug monographs identify permissible active ingredients, labeling, and claims. OTC monographs generally do not specify inactive ingredients that may be used in the manufacture of OTC drugs. OTC drugs marketed in compliance with a final monograph are generally recognized and safe and effective, and are exempt from premarket approval requirements.
The FDA has also issued “tentative final monographs,” which are proposed rules or administrative orders that, when finalized, will become final monographs. The FDA allows drugs that comply with the tentative final monograph to be marketed under its enforcement discretion policy. Once the monograph is finalized for that therapeutic class of drug, marketing must then conform to the final monograph, or the OTC drug products will be considered adulterated or misbranded under the FD&C Act and marketing will be prohibited.
The active ingredients in the Company’s products offered under CBD CLINIC, CBDMEDIC, and HARMONY HEMP brands (lidocaine, menthol and camphor) are currently covered by an OTC tentative final monograph for external analgesic drug products, which was published in the Federal Register on February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5852). The tentative final monograph does not specify what inactive ingredients may be used in the manufacture of such analgesics. This tentative final monograph is part of the FDA’s ongoing review of OTC drug products.
Inactive ingredients do not require individual approval by the FDA. The FDA evaluates an inactive ingredient within the context of an NDA. After approval of the NDA, the FDA will list the inactive ingredients in the approved drug product in the FDA’s Inactive Ingredient Database. Based on the listings in this Database, the FDA has not approved an NDA for a new drug containing CBD as an inactive ingredient. FDA does not list OTC inactive ingredients in the Inactive Ingredient Database for OTC drug products manufactured and marketed in accordance with an OTC monograph. It is the drug manufacturer’s responsibility to ensure the suitability and safety of the inactive ingredients in its OTC monographed drug products.
There is inherent risk in marketing an OTC product containing CBD as an active or inactive ingredient, or a dietary supplement containing CBD due to IND Preclusion based on the drug approval awarded to Epidiolex and the FDA’s existing guidance on the introduction of CBD in the food supply and marketing hemp as a dietary supplement. FDA policies and regulations may change from time to time, requiring formulation, packaging, or labeling changes or requiring the submission of an NDA for a drug product containing any amount of CBD. Although some states have passed laws that permit certain CBD products despite contrary federal laws, such state laws may also change. The Company cannot predict whether new federal or state regulations or legislation affecting the use of CBD in OTC drug products or any of the activities of the Company will be enacted or what effect any regulation or legislation would have on the Company’s business.
On March 22, 2021, the FDA issued a news release announcing the issuance of warning letters to two companies for selling OTC products labeled as containing CBD, alleging that the products are illegally marketed unapproved 
drugs. The letters explain that, because CBD has known pharmacological effects on humans, with demonstrated risks, it cannot be legally marketed as an inactive ingredient in OTC drug products that are not reviewed and approved by the FDA. In the letters, the FDA also alleged the products are misbranded due to the prominent featuring of CBD on the labeling, which the Agency stated is misleading because it presents the CBD inactive ingredients “in a manner that creates an impression of value greater than their true functional role in the formulation.” 
The CBD CLINIC and CBDMEDIC products are manufactured by a third-party manufacturer, Aidance, in an FDA-registered facility which complies with cGMP requirements. The CBD CLINIC and CBDMEDIC products are manufactured under the Aidance Manufacturing and Services Agreement and are marketed in compliance with an OTC tentative final monograph for external analgesic drug products as described above. As such, the Company takes the position that these products are exempt from the requirements for an NDA or ANDA pre-market approval. Aidance, as the manufacturer, has registered the facility and listed each of the Company’s FDA products with the FDA on the FDA website, whereby a National Drug Code (“NDC”) number was issued for the product. The Company currently has approximately 40 products that have been issued an FDA NDC number. There is no assurance that the position taken by the Company that its products are exempt from the requirements for an NDA or ANDA pre-market approval will not, in the future, be challenged by the FDA, which could result in material adverse effects to the Company and its business.
The FD&C Act provides that a substance added to food is unsafe unless the substance is GRAS ("Generally Recognized as Safe"). The FDA has not recognized CBD as GRAS for human consumption, although certain hemp seed derivatives may be considered GRAS.  Further research is needed to determine if other cannabinoids would be considered GRAS or what steps would be necessary for them to be recognized as GRAS. In the meantime, stakeholders including the Company are collecting data to pursue a GRAS determination for CBD, as the FDA has indicated it cannot conclude that CBD is GRAS due to the current lack of information to support this determination. As discussed below on March 6, 2020, the Company achieved self-affirmed GRAS status for its hemp extract, adding to the current body of scientific literature on the safe use of CBD. Enforcement of this prohibition on the use of CBD in food has been generally limited to products making unlawful drug or disease claims, with the FDA also asserting its position that CBD is not a permissible food or dietary supplement ingredient. The Company’s products containing CBD derived from Hemp are not marketed or sold using claims that the products are intended to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent disease in violation of the FD&C Act.
In October 2017, the Company received a warning letter from FDA regarding claims being made for its products and citing to FDA’s position concerning the IND Preclusion (the “Warning Letter”). The Company responded in two phases: (1) one letter identifying corrective actions made to its website and marketing related to product claims; and (2) a separate letter responding to FDA’s comments on IND Preclusion and establishing the Company’s position that CBD is not precluded from being a food or dietary ingredient since it was marketed in a food or dietary supplement prior to substantial clinical investigations being instituted and being made public.
On May 23, 2018, the Company received a response from FDA noting the changes to the Company’s website and marketing, but also indicating the FDA did not agree with the Company’s position that CBD is not precluded from being a food or dietary ingredient since it was marketed in a food or dietary supplement prior to substantial clinical investigations being instituted and being made public. As stated above, the Company does not agree with the FDA’s position regarding the legality of CBD as ingredients in foods and dietary supplements. The Company has asked

FDA to elaborate on the basis for its position in a July 11, 2018 letter to the agency, since FDA’s May 23, 2018 response did not provide any such basis. To date, the Company has not received a direct response to its July 11, 2018 letter.
On December 20, 2018, the FDA released a statement from former Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, which restated FDA’s current position, opining that products containing CBD ingredients may not be sold as food or dietary supplements. The statement also contained, for the first time, a clear path toward FDA’s permanent and formal acceptance of hemp-derived CBD as a food or dietary supplement ingredient. For the first time, the FDA has indicated that it is considering using its authority to issue a regulation that will specifically allow hemp-derived CBD in foods and supplements.
Statements from the FDA issued in July 2019 made clear that the FDA is “[p]aving the way for regulatory clarity[.]”  FDA “is committed to evaluating the regulatory frameworks for non-drug uses, including products marketed as foods and dietary supplements[.]”  Importantly, FDA “recognize[s] that there is substantial public interest in marketing and accessing CBD in food, including dietary supplements . . . [and that] [t]he statutory provisions that currently prohibit marketing CBD in these forms also allow the FDA to issue a regulation creating an exception, and some stakeholders have asked that the FDA consider issuing such a regulation to allow for the marketing of CBD in conventional foods or as a dietary supplement, or both.”
As it continues down this path, the FDA is “[l]istening to and learning from stakeholders[.]”  The FDA held a public hearing on May 31, 2019 to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling, and sale of products containing Hemp or Hemp-derived compounds. Numerous hemp industry stakeholders and consumers shared their perspectives and have met with the FDA’s CBD Working Group, which is reviewing the use of CBD as a food and dietary supplement ingredient.
On July 16, 2019, the FDA issued a consumer update on its efforts to address “unanswered questions about the science, safety, and quality of products containing CBD” through the feedback from the May 31, 2019 hearing and information and data gathered through a public docket. Specifically, the FDA noted concerns regarding potential liver toxicity, questions about cumulative exposure to CBD over time, the effects of CBD on special populations (e.g., the elderly, children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women), and the safety of CBD use in animals including pets. On October 16, 2019, the FDA issued another consumer update cautioning against the use of CBD, THC, and marijuana during pregnancy or while breastfeeding due to the current lack of comprehensive research studying the effects of CBD on the developing fetus, pregnant mother, or breastfed baby.  On November 25, 2019, the FDA provided another consumer update stating there is limited available information about CBD, including about its effects on the body.  The FDA also sent another round of warning letters to companies marketing CBD products with disease claims. Some letters were jointly issued by the FTC. In addition, the agency reiterated its position that CBD cannot be added to food and dietary supplements and stated that it is “not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS [Generally Recognized as Safe] among qualified experts for its use in human or animal

food.” 45 As stated above, the letters targeted companies whose products violated the FD&C Act’s prohibition against: i) marketing CBD as or in a dietary supplement, human and animal food, or food additives; ii) marketing a dietary supplement, human and animal food, or cosmetic with disease or drug claims (i.e., claims suggesting that a product is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease); iii) including a substance in human or animal food when that substance is not GRAS; and iv) selling products that are misbranded due to their failure to include “adequate directions for use by a layperson”.
On March 5, 2020, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen M. Hahn issued a statement on the FDA’s work related to CBD products. The statement makes clear that the FDA is taking steps to solicit additional public feedback, data, and research on the science, safety, and quality of CBD products. These new steps include re-opening the public docket so that FDA can obtain additional scientific data on CBD, which will include a process by which confidential and proprietary information can be shared with the FDA and kept protected. Additionally, former Commissioner Hahn’s statement reiterates that the FDA will continue to monitor and police the CBD products marketplace and is evaluating the issuance of a risk-based enforcement policy that provides greater transparency and clarity regarding factors the FDA intends to consider in prioritizing enforcement decisions.
The Company believes it is clear from former Commissioner Hahn’s statements, and also from FDA’s prior guidance, that topical cosmetic products are not currently subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as ingestible products that contain CBD. For instance, while FDA notes that topical products must comply with all applicable legal requirements including the adulteration and misbranding provisions of the FD&C Act specific to cosmetic products, FDA’s website states that “[c]ertain cosmetic ingredients are prohibited or restricted by regulation, but currently that is not the case for any cannabis or cannabis-derived ingredients.” Additionally, former Commissioner Hahn had positively suggested that the effects of CBD may differ depending on the route of administration.
Much of former Commissioner Hahn’s statement was also included in the FDA’s congressionally mandated report on CBD, which was also submitted on March 5, 2020. On the issue of topical products, the report states that “[c]osmetic ingredients do not generally require premarket approval (with the exception that most color additives do require premarket approval)” and that “it is possible that some individual products containing CBD fall outside of FDA’s jurisdiction.” The report confirms that the FDA is actively considering pathways to allow the marketing of CBD as a dietary supplement, which may include notice-and-comment rulemaking and interim risk-based enforcement policies. The report signals the FDA’s continued interest in certain aspects of CBD, including effects from sustained use, effects from different methods of exposure, and effects on the developing brain and on the unborn child and breastfed newborn. The report acknowledges that the FDA is receiving inquiries about whether “full spectrum” and “broad spectrum” Hemp products can currently be marketed and sold as dietary supplements, but the FDA has not yet answered the question conclusively. Largely, the report does little to address the current regulatory ambiguity for hemp derived extracts with naturally occurring CBD and does not set a timeline for agency action, but it does signal the FDA’s interest in a pathway for the use of CBD in dietary supplements. Further to this point, former Commissioner Hahn had publicly stated that it would be a “fool’s game” for the FDA to pull CBD products from the market entirely, as their use is already widespread. As noted above, while the FDA has stated that it has made ”substantial progress” toward the goal of providing additional guidance on CBD products, in more recent statements the FDA has noted that it is still in the process of gathering data on the safety profile of CBD to inform public health decisions. To this end, on October 16, 2021, the FDA published a “Cannabis-Derived Products Data Acceleration Plan,” a portfolio of pilot initiatives and partnerships seeking to gather real time information from novel data sources about potential safety problems or adverse events associated with cannabis-derived products, including CBD products, and information about general patterns of product use and emerging trends. It is unclear whether the newly appointed Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf will take the same stance on CBD as former Commissioner Hahn, or continue the progress toward a clear regulatory pathway for CBD products, in particular for dietary supplements and food products.
Despite the position taken by the FDA that there is no evidence of CBD being marketed as a food or dietary supplement prior to drug trials being commenced and made public, the Company believes there is substantial

uncertainty and different interpretations among state and federal regulatory agencies, legislators, academics and businesses as to whether cannabinoids including CBD were present in the food supply and marketed prior to October 15, 1994 or whether such inclusion of cannabinoids is otherwise permitted by the FDA as dietary ingredients. As a result, the Company believes the federal legality regarding the distribution and sale of hemp-based products intended for human consumption must be considered on a case-by-case basis and that the uncertainties cannot be resolved without further federal legislation, regulation or a definitive judicial interpretation of existing legislation and rules. A final determination by the FDA that Hemp products containing CBD or other cannabinoids are not permissible for use as a dietary ingredient, may have a materially adverse effect upon the Company and its business. Moreover, if the FDA were to enforce the IND Preclusion based on its interpretation of the legislation, this would have a materially adverse effect upon the Company and its business.
Future Uncertainty of Legal Status
There remain a number of considerations and uncertainties regarding the cultivation, sourcing, production and distribution of Hemp and products containing hemp derivatives. Applicable laws and regulations remain subject to change as there are different interpretations among federal, state and local regulatory agencies, legislators, academics and businesses with respect to the treatment of the importation of derivatives from exempted portions of the Cannabis plant and the scope of operation of 2018 Farm Bill-compliant hemp programs. These different federal, state and local agency interpretations, as discussed above, touch on the regulation of cannabinoids by the FDA and the extent to which imported derivatives, and/or 2018 Farm Bill-compliant cultivators and processors may engage in interstate commerce, whether under federal and/or state law. The uncertainties likely cannot be resolved without further federal and state legislation, regulation or a definitive judicial interpretation of existing legislation and rules.
Materially all of the Company’s assets, liabilities and operations are exposed to U.S. Hemp-related activities.
The Company's Regulatory Compliance Activities in the United States
The Company’s senior management team regularly monitors the development of applicable U.S. laws and the Company engages U.S. legal counsel to facilitate compliance with applicable laws and permits. These compliance-related activities include efforts affecting the following objectives, when and as applicable:
•ensuring all raw materials are sourced in compliance with the 2018 Farm Bill and applicable state and local laws;
•evaluating supply chain partners for quality standards;
•setting and maintaining quality standards through raw material specifications;
•employing qualified quality assurance personnel; and
•ensuring processing activities performed in Colorado comply with CDPHE Guidance, the Colorado Food and Drug Act, and the Colorado Industrial Hemp Regulatory Program Act.
In January 2019 the Company received U.S. Hemp Authority Certification. The U.S. Hemp Authority is an industry self-regulatory organization. The U.S. Hemp Authority Certification program provides education on standards and best practices for the hemp industry and continued certification requires an annual third-party audit.
On March 6, 2020, the Company completed its assessment for self-affirmed GRAS status for its hemp extract. The Company made this determination based on composite safety information and an expert panel review as permitted under the FDA’s GRAS regulation.  According to the GRAS definition,  experts can generally recognize a substance as safe through either (1) scientific procedures, or (2) experience based on common use before January 1, 1958. The FDA’s GRAS regulation provides a voluntary notification process under which a company may notify the FDA of a conclusion that a substance is GRAS under the conditions of its intended use, or make an independent conclusion of GRAS (“self-affirmed GRAS”), where the conclusion of GRAS status remains with the firm or

company rather than being submitted to the Agency for review. The criteria and eligibility for self-affirmed GRAS must fully satisfy the criteria for eligibility of GRAS as if it were being submitted through the notification process. In addition, a company may make a self-affirmation for any ingredient that would also be eligible to go through the GRAS notification process (with some exceptions). The Company achieved this recognition of safety through scientific procedures (i.e., safety and toxicology studies), a comprehensive literature review of CBD, and by publishing the results of its safety studies in accordance with FDA guidelines for GRAS.
Environmental Regulation
The Company’s hemp extract wellness products and cultivation operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations and permitting requirements regarding air emissions, water discharges and the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes, among other matters. Compliance with such regulations and requirements have not had, nor are they expected to have, any direct material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, such factors could indirectly affect the Company and its business, operations, vendors or suppliers, or could impact those with whom the Company serves or is served by in the supply chain for the Company’s products. While the Company has no reason to believe the operation of its facilities violates any such regulations or requirements, if such a violation were to occur, or if environmental regulations were to become more stringent in the future, the Company could be adversely affected.
International Regulatory Matters
The Company is currently exploring partnerships for local production, manufacturing and/or distribution in select international markets. Legislative approaches to the regulation of CBD-related products vary country by country, including local regulations with respect to THC content, and continue to evolve. For example, to comply with more restrictive THC content specifications in Europe, products cultivated therein must contain no more than 0.2% THC. In some cases, there may be a disconnect between a foreign country’s import requirements and the United States’ export requirements with respect to Hemp. The Company makes decisions as to international expansion upon completion of a regulatory review and assessment of risk.
International sales activities may require compliance with the THC content limits of the applicable international jurisdictions in which the Company sells its U.S.-manufactured products, as well as applicable local regulations regarding the import and sale in such jurisdictions. The Company periodically reviews changes in applicable U.S. export laws, regulations and departmental practices as well as applicable international laws and adjusts its sales practices accordingly, including the temporary suspension of sales, if necessary. In addition to its regulatory review regarding potential international production, manufacturing and distribution activities, the Company periodically reviews the current compliance procedures implemented by its mail-order/online distributors. International sales only take place in a country once the applicable review of current regulatory regimes and a risk assessment is complete and appropriate compliance procedures have been implemented or updated.
The Company has sold its products in United Kingdom, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Italy, Puerto Rico, and Uruguay, and to other jurisdictions through third-party distributors who take delivery in bulk and manage individual orders. Each of these countries regulates the import of Cannabis-derived products and requires some form of importation license, permit or other documentation for products. The exact nature of the importation documentation varies from country to country, and is affected by various factors, including the level of THC content and the intended use of the product. For example, in certain international jurisdictions, CBD products may be regulated as a dietary supplement and subject to local packaging and labelling requirements, whereas in certain jurisdictions a prescription from a licensed medical practitioner is required.
In the event it is determined that sales or distributions were conducted in contravention of a local law or regulation, the Company may be subject to penalties imposed by the applicable jurisdiction. To the knowledge of the Company, it has not breached any substantive foreign law. However, were there such a breach, the Company does not believe such non-compliance would have a material adverse effect on the Company given the limited amount of sales, the 
fact that all sales were conducted by recognized local distributors for whom the Company’s products typically represented a small portion of total sales of hemp-products in the jurisdiction and the lack of notice of regulatory non-compliance to date. See “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to the Regulatory Environment – The Company is subject to regulations that could impact its ability to sell its product internationally.”
Canada
Canada’s legal cannabis framework falls under the Cannabis Act (“Cannabis Act”) and associated regulations. Under the Cannabis Act, Health Canada is the body which ultimately oversees the regulation of cannabis, for both recreational and medical use. In addition to setting the rules for the licensed producers around cultivation, processing, sale, packaging, advertising and on, the Cannabis Act and its regulations also set the baseline for individuals rights and restrictions with respect to Cannabis. The Industrial Hemp Regulations (the “Regulations”) fall under the Cannabis Act and govern industrial hemp, meaning a cannabis plant, or any part thereof, in which the concentration of THC is 0.3% water weight or less in the flowering heads and leaves. Under the Regulations, licensed holders may conduct activities such as the sale, import or export of seed or grain, cultivate, possess for leaning or processing or obtain by growing, industrial hemp, as licensed. Licensed holders must also hold an import and export permit for each shipment that is imported and may not import or export in bulk. 
The Company has sought and obtained registration on Health Canada’s List of Approved Cultivars (“LOAC”) for two of its early maturing hemp varieties – named “Duchess” and “Ambassador.” These strains were developed for cultivation in shorter northern climate growing seasons, and are among the first cultivars on the LOAC that are early flowering and early maturing for outdoor cultivation and harvesting within the shorter Canadian growing season. Charlotte’s Web’s approved cultivars are three of 15 added to the LOAC for the 2021 growing season and has remained on the LOAC for the 2022 growing season. Once on the LOAC, a license holder may cultivate the approved cultivars for commercial cultivation for that growing season. The approved cultivars include the Company’s original “CW1AS1” U.S. patented genetics, which allows licensors to cultivate Charlotte’s Web’s leading CBD wellness cultivars in Canada. 
The Company licenses its intellectual property rights to third party licensed producers in Canada. Licensed producers may, in turn, process and sell the products grown from the underlying cultivars under the legal framework in place under the Cannabis Act.
