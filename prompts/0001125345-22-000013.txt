Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative antibody-based therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. We have a pipeline of product candidates being evaluated in clinical trials sponsored by us or our collaborators. These product candidates include six immuno-oncology programs, many of which were created using our proprietary, antibody-based technology platforms. We believe our product candidates have the potential, if approved for marketing by regulatory authorities, to have a meaningful effect on treating patients' unmet medical needs as monotherapy or, in some cases, in combination with other therapeutic agents. In March 2021, we and our commercialization partner commenced U.S. marketing of MARGENZA (margetuximab-cmkb), a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor antagonist indicated, in combination with chemotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens, at least one of which was for metastatic disease.
We are developing product candidates that target various tumor-associated antigens and immune checkpoint molecules. Our lead pipeline program is MGC018, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets B7-H3, a molecule in the B7 family of immune regulator proteins that is widely expressed by several different tumor types. We are also developing enoblituzumab, an Fc-optimized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets B7-H3 and molecules that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), a protein that is important in the regulation of the immune system’s response to cancer. Our clinical pipeline includes two bispecific DART product candidates that co-engage both PD-1 and LAG-3, or lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (tebotelimab), and PD-1 and CTLA-4, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (lorigerlimab). In addition, we are developing MGD024, a next-generation bispecific DART molecule that engages CD3 on immune effector cells to kill CD123-expressing cancer cells in certain hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Finally, we and our collaboration partners are developing product candidates for which we retain certain economic rights. These product candidates include IMGC936, a clinical-stage ADC that targets ADAM9, a cell surface protein over-expressed in several solid tumor types; retifanlimab, an anti-PD-1 mAb that we out-licensed and teplizumab, an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, sold to a partner.
We have created our product candidates based on the following antibody-based technologies:
•Multi-specific platforms, which enable us to design antibodies that can bind to two (in the case of our bispecific DART product candidates) or more distinct targets;
•Fc Optimization platform, which introduces certain mutations into the Fc domain of a monoclonal antibody in order to modulate antibody interaction with immune effector cells to enhance the killing of cancer cells; and
•ADC platforms, which we have licensed from collaboration partners, and which link monoclonal antibodies that specifically target cancer cells with cytotoxins that are designed to trigger cell death in the cancer cell.
Our goal is to be a fully-integrated biotechnology company leading in the discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization of breakthrough antibody-based biologics for the treatment of patients with cancer.
Our Pipeline of Immuno-Oncology Clinical Product Candidates for Which We Retain Commercial Rights
The table below depicts the status of our immuno-oncology product candidates that are in clinical development and for which we retain all or some commercial rights:
B7-H3 Programs
We have two clinical-stage programs, MGC018 and enoblituzumab, that target B7-H3 (CD276), an immune checkpoint molecule that is overexpressed in cancer tissues while showing limited expression in normal tissues. B7-H3 belongs to the B7 family of immune regulator proteins that is widely expressed by different tumor types and may play a key role in regulating the immune response to various cancers. There are no currently approved therapeutic agents directed against B7-H3.
MGC018 
MGC018 is an investigational ADC with a cleavable peptide linker designed to deliver a DNA-alkylating duocarmycin payload to dividing and non-dividing cells on solid tumors that express B7-H3. The underlying ADC technology was licensed from Byondis B.V. After completing a dose escalation study in 2020, we commenced the ongoing Phase 1/2 dose expansion study of MGC018 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The purpose of this ongoing study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary antitumor activity of the molecule. The Phase 1/2 study dose expansion cohorts are fully enrolled for patients with mCRPC (n=40), and smaller cohorts (n=approximately 20 each) of patients with NSCLC, melanoma, and TNBC, while we continue to recruit patients for the SCCHN cohort. We expect to provide details regarding further development plans in mCRPC, including a potential registration-directed study, in the first half of 2022, following interaction with regulatory agencies in the first quarter of 2022. We also plan to present additional data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of MGC018 in the second half of 2022. In addition, we expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 dose escalation study of MGC018 in combination with lorigerlimab (formerly MDG019), a bispecific monoclonal antibody designed to block PD-1 and CTLA-4, in patients with solid tumors.
Dose Escalation Study Results (as of May 2020)
In May 2020, data from the dose escalation study of MGC018 was initially presented. At the May 6, 2020 data cut-off, 23 evaluable patients with advanced solid tumors had been enrolled in four dose escalation cohorts of 0.5 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg given intravenously every three weeks. Treatment was ongoing in an expanded fifth cohort of patients at 4 mg/kg every three weeks at the data cut-off date.
At the May 6, 2020 data cut off, preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity by MGC018 was observed in the dose escalation portion of the study, particularly in patients with advanced mCRPC. Reductions in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of ≥ 50% were observed in five of seven mCRPC patients treated, including one with substantial regression of bone disease. Six mCRPC patients had bone-only disease, and one patient with measurable peripheral disease had a 29% reduction in target lesions that did not qualify as a response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST). Four PSA responders remained on therapy as of the data cut-off. Patients with mCRPC had received a median of four therapies prior to MGC018, including taxane chemotherapy (six patients) and next-generation hormonal agents (six patients were treated with both abiraterone and enzalutamide, and one with abiraterone only).
Through dose escalation, the safety profile of MGC018, which had included hematologic and skin toxicities, was generally manageable as of the data cut-off. At least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) occurred in 22 of 23 patients (96%), including Grade ≥ 3 reported in 14 of 23 patients (61%). Three treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in one patient each: pneumonitis in a patient with concurrent bacterial pneumonia; non-infectious gastroenteritis; and stasis dermatitis in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency. One dose-limiting toxicity of Grade 4 neutropenia that resolved to baseline was reported. No febrile neutropenia was observed.
Phase 1/2 Dose Expansion Study Results (as of May 2021)
The Phase 1/2 dose expansion study of MGC018 in patients with mCRPC, TNBC and NSCLC was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020. As of the May 3, 2021 cut-off, updated clinical data from the Phase 1 study of MGC018 was presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting demonstrating anti-tumor activity in patients with melanoma and mCRPC. Preliminary results in the mCRPC cohort expansion showed 11 of 22 patients (50%) had a PSA reduction of 50% or greater, with anti-tumor activity observed in four of seven patients with measurable disease who had their first 9-week imaging results available, including one unconfirmed partial response. Anti-tumor activity was also reported in all three melanoma patients who received 4 mg/kg in dose escalation, with one patient achieving a confirmed partial response. 
Phase 1/2 Dose Expansion Study Results (as of August 2021)
Preliminary clinical results from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of MGC018 in patients with solid tumors was presented at the 2021 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Meeting. As of the August 16, 2021 data cut-off, a total of 86 patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled in the cohort expansion of MGC018 at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 3.0 mg/kg, administered intravenously every three weeks. The enrollment included 40 patients with mCRPC, 21 patients with NSCLC, 16 patients with TNBC and nine patients with melanoma. In addition, enrollment of patients with SCCHN had been initiated. The safety analysis included all enrolled patients, whereas the efficacy analysis was limited to mCRPC and NSCLC patients; enrollment was ongoing in the other tumor cohorts. In the cohort expansion, tumor response by investigator per RECIST was evaluated every nine weeks for all patients and PSA was assessed every three weeks in mCRPC.
As of the August 16, 2021 data cut-off, all 40 patients in the mCRPC cohort expansion had been enrolled. Patients had previously received a median of three prior therapies for advanced disease, with all 40 patients having received both chemotherapy and next-generation hormonal therapy. Based on an immunohistochemistry assessment of patient tumor samples, the median B7-H3 H-score (a combined score of the intensity and the proportion of B7-H3 expression, comprising values between 0 and 300) for all mCRPC patients was 223. A total of 39 mCRPC patients were evaluable for PSA response. Reductions in PSA levels of ≥ 50% were observed in 21 of 39 patients (54%). Twenty-four of the 39 patients (62%) remained on treatment as of the data cut-off. Of the 40 patients in the mCRPC cohort, 16 of the 23 patients with measurable disease were evaluable for tumor response by RECIST as of the data cut-off. Ten of these 16 patients (63%) had reductions in their target lesion sums from baseline. Four patients (25%) demonstrated a partial response (PR), consisting of two confirmed and two unconfirmed PRs. Treatment was ongoing in six of 16 patients with evaluable tumor response as of the data cut-off.
As of the August 16, 2021 data cut-off, the NSCLC cohort expansion had been fully enrolled with 21 patients. Patients had previously received a median of two prior therapies for advanced disease, with 15 (71%) having previously received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. The median B7-H3 H-score for these patients was 139. A total of 16 NSCLC patients were evaluable for tumor response by RECIST. Thirteen of 16 (81%) patients had reductions in their target lesion sums from baseline. Four of these 16 patients (25%) experienced unconfirmed partial responses. Another one of these 16 patients experienced a 30% reduction in target lesions; however, the patient’s non-target lesions were not evaluated due to an obstruction of the bronchus and overall response was not evaluable. Treatment was ongoing in seven of 16 patients as of the data cut-off.
The safety analysis includes all 86 patients enrolled in the cohort expansion as of the August 16, 2021 data cut-off. The median number of doses received by mCRPC patients was 3.5 (range: 1-8); those with NSCLC received 3.0 (range: 1-7). Adverse events for the dose expansion cohorts of 3 mg/kg were generally consistent with those previously reported at ASCO 2021. TRAEs included hematologic and skin toxicities that have been clinically manageable to date. In the cohort expansion study overall, at least one TRAE of any grade was experienced by 78 of 86 patients (91%), with 43 of 86 patients (50%) experiencing a Grade ≥3 TRAE. There were two Grade 5 fatal events: one from an unknown cause and one due to SARS-CoV-2.
The most common TRAEs were fatigue (37% all grades; 1% Grade ≥3), neutropenia (34% all grades; 22% Grade ≥3), palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (31% all grades; 4% Grade ≥3), pleural effusion (23% all grades; 1% Grade ≥3), nausea (22% all grades; 1% Grade ≥3), asthenia (20% all grades; 5% Grade ≥3) and thrombocytopenia (14% all grades; 7% 
Grade ≥3). The overall results demonstrated a manageable safety profile with a low rate of treatment discontinuation due to TRAEs: only six of 86 (7%) patients had discontinued therapy in the cohort expansion as of the data cut-off date due to TRAEs.
Enoblituzumab
Enoblituzumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that targets B7-H3 that has been engineered using our Fc Optimization platform. We are currently evaluating enoblituzumab in combination with checkpoint molecules in patients with SCCHN in an ongoing Phase 2 study. The combination of enoblituzumab and immune checkpoint blockade is designed to engage innate and adaptive immunity to enhance tumor cell killing. 
We had initially conducted a Phase 1b/2 clinical study combining enoblituzumab and pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with B7-H3-expressing melanoma, SCCHN, NSCLC and urothelial cancer. A total of 133 patients were treated in the study.
As presented in November 2018 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting, in the SCCHN dose expansion cohort, confirmed PRs were observed in 6 of 18 (33%) patients evaluable for response who had not previously received anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. For the subset of patients with B7-H3 tumor expression ≥ 10%, 6 of 15 (40%) had confirmed PRs. Objective response rates (ORRs) ranging from 13% to 16% have previously been reported in SCCHN patients treated with anti-PD-1 agents alone. The combination of enoblituzumab and an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody demonstrated acceptable tolerability, with any adverse event ≥ Grade 3 occurring in 27.1% of patients as of the October 12, 2018 data cut-off date. The rate of immune-related adverse events experienced in the trial was comparable to that historically observed by others in patients who received pembrolizumab as monotherapy.
To further inform the development of enoblituzumab, we initiated a Phase 2 study of this agent in patients with relapsed or metastatic SCCHN not curable by local therapy in the first quarter of 2021. This trial includes enoblituzumab in a chemotherapy-free regimen in combination with either retifanlimab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients who are programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive or with tebotelimab, a bispecific checkpoint targeting both PD-1 and LAG-3, in patients who are PD-L1 negative. We expect to complete enrollment of the PD-L1 positive patient cohort during the first half of 2022 and provide an update on this cohort during the second half of 2022.
In July 2019, we licensed the right to develop and commercialize enoblituzumab in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan to I-Mab Biopharma (I-Mab). I-Mab plans to both lead regional studies in its territories as well as participate in global studies conducted by us. In December 2021, I-Mab announced that the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approved its Investigational New Drug (IND) submission for the initiation of a Phase 2 trial in China for enoblituzumab in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumors, including NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma and other selected cancers.
T-cell Redirected Bispecific DART Molecules
We are developing a bispecific DART molecule that can simultaneously target T-cells and tumor cell surface antigens to engage and promote redirected T-cell killing of cancer cells. CD123, the interleukin-3 receptor alpha chain, is widely overexpressed in various hematologic malignancies, including AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), making it an attractive therapeutic target. Various drugs have been developed to target CD123, but none have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. We have created two bispecific DART molecules that engage CD3 expressed on immune effector cells, such as T cells, to kill CD123-expressing cancer cells for the potential treatment of certain hematologic malignancies, including AML. One of these DART molecules, flotetuzumab, is being discontinued due to reprioritization to more efficiently utilize our financial and human resources to focus on the next-generation version of the molecule, MGD024.
MGD024
MGD024 is an investigational, next-generation, bispecific CD123 × CD3 DART molecule designed to minimize cytokine-release syndrome, while maintaining anti-tumor cytolytic activity, and permitting intermittent dosing through a longer half-life. In December 2021, we presented preclinical MGD024 data at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting that showed the potential for anti-tumor activity from the combination of MGD024 with standard of care agents used to treat AML. We submitted an IND to the FDA for MGD024 in the fourth quarter of 2021, and plan to initiate a Phase 1 study of MG024 in patients with hematologic malignancies, pending IND clearance by the FDA.
Flotetuzumab
Flotetuzumab is an investigational bispecific, humanized DART molecule that recognizes both CD123 and CD3. In a single-arm study evaluating flotetuzumab, our first generation, continuous infusion CD123 x CD3 DART molecule, in AML patients who were refractory to induction therapy, activity looked promising with manageable safety. Nonetheless, we recently decided to prioritize the development of MGD024 and discontinue development of flotetuzumab, in view of our belief that MGD024 may offer certain advantages over flotetuzumab, including easier dose administration and the ability to be combined with other agents.
Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
Checkpoint inhibition has become an important staple of oncology. Our clinical pipeline includes three product candidates in clinical development that target checkpoint molecules for the potential treatment of a broad range of solid tumors. These candidates include two bispecific DART product candidates that co-engage PD-1 and other checkpoint molecules and an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody that we have out-licensed to a partner.
Lorigerlimab (formerly MGD019)
Approved monoclonal antibodies that target the immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4 have shown enhanced clinical antitumor activity when given in combination in various cancers, including renal cell carcinoma and NSCLC with high tumor mutational burden. Lorigerlimab is an investigational, bispecific tetravalent DART molecule designed to enable simultaneous and/or independent blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4, with potentially enhanced CTLA-4 blockade on T cells co-expressing these immune checkpoint molecules.
We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of lorigerlimab in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study is designed to enroll patients with histologically proven, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom no approved therapy with demonstrated clinical benefit is available or patients who are intolerant to standard therapy. Forty-three patients were enrolled in the 3+3+3 dose escalation study within a dose range of 0.03 – 10.0 mg/kg, administered every three weeks initially, in a population of heavily pre-treated patients representing a broad range of different types (23) of solid tumors. A total of 28 patients were treated at doses ≥ 3.0 mg/kg administered every three weeks initially. Of the 18 evaluable patients who received doses ≥ 3.0 mg/kg as of the July 21, 2020 cut-off date, four objective responses were reported, including a confirmed complete response in mCRPC, confirmed PRs in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) and metastatic type AB thymoma, and an unconfirmed PR in serous fallopian tube carcinoma. Lorigerlimab was well-tolerated in patients who received less than 10 mg/kg. The most common TRAEs observed were pruritus (23.3%), arthralgia (18.6%), fatigue (18.6%), rash (18.6%), nausea (16.3%) and infusion-related reaction (16.3%) as of the data cut-off. Several Grade 3 adverse events were observed at the 10.0 mg/kg level; however, none were considered dose limiting.
In this study, full and sustained peripheral PD-1 blockade was evident at doses ≥ 1.0 mg/kg over a 3-week dosing interval. In addition, dose-dependent upregulation of the inducible costimulator (ICOS) molecule was evident in treated patients, including those who responded to lorigerlimab therapy. This is consistent with an observation previously reported in the literature that anti-CTLA-4 therapy increases the frequency of CD4 T cells expressing the ICOS molecule.
We are currently evaluating lorigerlimab in a Phase 1/2 dose expansion study in patients with MSS CRC, mCRPC, melanoma and checkpoint-naive NSCLC at a dose of 6.0 mg/kg, based on data from dose escalation, and expect to provide an update on this study in the second half of 2022. We also expect to initiate a Phase 1 dose escalation study of MGC018 and lorigerlimab in patients with solid tumors.
Tebotelimab
Tebotelimab is an investigational, first-in-class bispecific, tetravalent DART molecule targeting PD-1 and LAG-3. We have engineered tebotelimab to concomitantly or independently bind to PD-1 and LAG-3 and disrupt these non-redundant inhibitory pathways to further restore exhausted T-cell function. Tebotelimab was evaluated in a Phase 1/2 dose expansion study in several tumor types and is currently being studied in combination with enoblituzumab in SCCHN. We expect to provide an update on potential future development plans for tebotelimab in the second half of 2022.
In May 2020, initial data was presented from a Phase 1 study in which 53 patients with advanced tumors were treated with tebotelimab given intravenously in cohorts of escalating flat doses of 1-1200 mg every two weeks. A maximum tolerated dose was not identified. A flat dose of 600 mg every two weeks was selected for tumor-specific expansion cohorts. At the April 25, 2020 data cut-off, 205 patients with advanced solid and hematologic neoplasms had been treated with tebotelimab monotherapy in the ongoing dose-expansion part of the study, of which 152 were evaluable for response. Anti-tumor activity was assessed by RECIST.
Anti-tumor activity of tebotelimab as monotherapy was observed in evaluable patients across several of the tumor types in the selected dose expansion cohorts. ORRs, including both confirmed and unconfirmed responses, and disease control rate (DCR), comprising both confirmed objective responses and stable disease, were observed as follows: TNBC (17% ORR, 4 of 23 patients; 39% DCR, 9 of 23 patients), epithelial ovarian cancer (9% ORR, 2 of 23 patients; 52% DCR, 12 of 23 patients) and NSCLC (checkpoint inhibitor naïve: 21% ORR, 3 of 14 patients; 64% DCR, 9 of 14 patients; and post anti-PD-1: 13% ORR, 2 of 15 patients; 53% DCR, 8 of 15 patients). Response to tebotelimab monotherapy was associated with LAG-3 expression and an IFN-γ gene signature at baseline. The overall safety profile of tebotelimab in the Phase 1 study, including the incidence of immune-mediated adverse events, appeared generally consistent with anti-PD-1 antibody monotherapy with respect to event type and frequency.
Immune effector cell activation and LAG-3, PD-1 and PD-L1 expression has been shown to be enhanced in vitro by Fc-engineered margetuximab. An expansion cohort of patients with advanced HER2-positive tumors was treated with margetuximab plus tebotelimab to evaluate whether Fc-engineering can enhance tumor responsiveness to checkpoint blockade and improve clinical outcomes in patients. In November 2020, updated data was presented from the combination study of tebotelimab and margetuximab in patients with advanced HER2-positive neoplasms. In this study, 41 patients had been enrolled. As of the October 5, 2020 data cut-off, there were 28 response-evaluable patients. Evidence of antitumor activity was observed among refractory patients with various HER2-positive tumor types, including eight objective responses (six confirmed) observed in multiple advanced HER2-positive tumor types. The ORR (including unconfirmed responses) was 28.6%, while 64.3% of response-evaluable patients experienced a decrease in target lesion tumor burden. The duration of response for confirmed responders was 4.21–8.97 months, with three patients remaining on treatment as of the data cut-off. Of particular interest, a majority of responding patients had a baseline PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) ≤ 1. All responding patients carried the less favorable CD16A-158F allotype (i.e., V/F or F/F). Evaluation of baseline LAG-3 and PD-1 mRNA expression and potential association with clinical response analyses are ongoing, and will be important for defining patient enrichment biomarker strategies for further development. The combination of tebotelimab and margetuximab was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with that of tebotelimab monotherapy.
In December 2020, data was presented from the ongoing tebotelimab Phase 1/2 dose expansion study in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). LAG-3 has been shown to be highly expressed in DLBCL and has emerged as a therapeutic target of interest in this population, while PD-1-targeted therapy has yielded modest efficacy. There remains significant unmet need for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL. In this study, 20 DLBCL patients were enrolled, half of whom were chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy experienced. As of the October 23, 2020 data cut-off, there were 13 response-evaluable patients. A preliminary ORR of 53.8% (7 of 13 patients) was observed, including responses in five of seven CAR T cell-naïve patients and in two of six CAR T cell experienced patients, the latter of whom both had complete responses. A preliminary duration of response of up to 168 days was observed, with six of seven ongoing responses as of the cut-off date. In the study, baseline LAG-3 expression appeared to associate with clinical response, with additional analyses ongoing. Tebotelimab was generally well-tolerated among heavily pre-treated R/R DLBCL patients, with manageable infusion-related reactions and no evidence of tumor lysis syndrome. The most common TRAE was pyrexia, which occurred in three (15%) patients. A single Grade 3 TRAE of anemia was observed.
As part of our November 2018 license and collaboration agreement with Zai Lab Limited (Zai Lab), we licensed to them the right to develop and commercialize tebotelimab in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Zai Lab has led regional studies evaluating tebotelimab in various indications in its territory. Zai lab recently informed us that they have decided to discontinue development of tebotelimab for indications they were enrolling in their territory and is evaluating future development plans in other indications.
Margetuximab
We and our commercial partner, Eversana Life Science Services, LLC (Eversana), are currently marketing MARGENZA (margetuximab-cmkb), in combination with chemotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens, at least one of which was for metastatic disease. Margetuximab is an Fc-engineered, mAb that targets the HER2 oncoprotein. HER2 is expressed by tumor cells in breast, gastroesophageal and other solid tumors. 
As part of our November 2018 license and collaboration agreement, Zai Lab has the rights to develop margetuximab in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. On January 6, 2022, Zai Lab announced that the China NMPA had accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for margetuximab for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens, at least one of which was for metastatic disease, in combination with chemotherapy.
Adverse reactions occurring in greater than twenty percent of patients with MARGENZA in combination with chemotherapy were fatigue/asthenia (57%), nausea (33%), diarrhea (25%), and vomiting (21%). The MARGENZA U.S. Prescribing Information has a BOXED WARNING for left ventricular dysfunction and embryo-fetal toxicity. In addition, MARGENZA can cause infusion-related reactions (IRRs). IRRs occurred in 13% of patients treated with MARGENZA, with the majority reported as Grade 2 or less. Grade 3 IRRs occurred in 1.5% of patients.
Based on results from an earlier study combining margetuximab and pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 mAb, in patients with advanced HER2-positive gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) who had previously been treated with chemotherapy and trastuzumab, we initiated the MAHOGANY study in September 2019. This was a Phase 2/3 registration-directed clinical trial to evaluate, in Module A, margetuximab in combination with retifanlimab, an anti-PD-1 mAb, in patients with tumors that were both HER2 IHC3-positive and PD-L1 positive. This approach was designed as a chemotherapy-free regimen intended to engage both innate and adaptive immunity for the treatment of patients with gastric cancer (GC) or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer in the first-line setting.
In September 2021, we presented data from Part 1, Module A of the Phase 2/3 MAHOGANY clinical trial of margetuximab at the 2021 ESMO Virtual Conference. The efficacy data and safety cutoff dates were July 19 and August 3, 2021, respectively. Tumor shrinkage was observed in 32 of 41 patients (78%) with at least one post-baseline target lesion measurement. Twenty-one of 40 patients (53%) achieved confirmed responses by independent review, exceeding prespecified futility boundary for the trial. Median duration of response was 10.3 months as of data cutoff. Margetuximab plus retifanlimab was well tolerated with Grade 3 TRAEs in 19% of patients; no Grade 4 TRAEs or treatment-related deaths. 
While the results from the initial portion of Module A of this trial were encouraging, we subsequently decided and announced in November 2021 to prioritize other pipeline product candidates and not proceed with the next phase of this trial.
Zai Lab has decided to discontinue enrollment of Module B of the MAHOGANY study based on their review of both the clinical data and the changing treatment landscape.
Partnered Programs
Retifanlimab
Retifanlimab is an investigational mAb targeting PD-1. Marketed antibodies targeting this checkpoint molecule have shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of various tumors by releasing the "brakes" of the immune system and helping to restore the immune system's ability to detect and kill tumor cells. In 2017, we licensed retifanlimab to Incyte Corporation (Incyte) under a global collaboration and license agreement, although we retain the right to develop the molecule in combination with product candidates from our pipeline. 
In January 2021, Incyte announced that the FDA had accepted for Priority Review its Biologics License Application (BLA) for retifanlimab as a potential treatment for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCAC) who have progressed on, or who are intolerant of, platinum-based chemotherapy. 
On July 23, 2021, Incyte announced that the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding its BLA for retifanlimab. Incyte’s announcement indicated that the FDA determined that additional data were needed to demonstrate the clinical benefit of retifanlimab for the submitted indication, and that Incyte was reviewing the CRL and would discuss next steps with the FDA. Incyte subsequently withdrew its European application for marketing authorization of retifanlimab for the treatment of SCAC. Incyte has stated it is pursuing development of retifanlimab in potentially registration-enabling studies beyond SCAC, including in patients with microsatellite instability-high, or MSI-high, endometrial cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Incyte is also pursuing development of retifanlimab in combination with multiple product candidates from its pipeline. 
During the first quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 study of enoblituzumab in a chemotherapy-free regimen in combination with retifanlimab in front-line SCCHN patients who are PD-L1 positive and with tebotelimab in SCCHN patients who are PD-L1 negative.
IMGC936
IMGC936 is an ADC that targets ADAM9, a cell surface protein over-expressed in several solid tumor types. IMGC936 is being advanced under a co-development agreement with ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen). Under the 50/50 
collaboration, ImmunoGen is leading clinical development and the Phase 1 dose escalation study is currently enrolling patients with select advanced solid tumors and ImmunoGen has indicated they anticipate disclosing initial data in 2022.
Teplizumab 
In 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Provention Bio, Inc. (Provention) pursuant to which they acquired our interest in teplizumab, a monoclonal antibody we had been developing for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Teplizumab has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA and PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency. We are entitled to received future milestones payments and royalties on net sales.
In January 2021, Provention announced that a BLA for teplizumab for the delay or prevention of clinical type 1 diabetes (T1D) in at-risk individuals had been filed by the FDA, which granted Provention's request for Priority Review. Provention is currently also evaluating teplizumab in patients with newly diagnosed insulin-dependent T1D in the Phase 3 PROTECT study, which has been fully recruited. Provention has indicated that it expects to report top line data from the Phase 3 PROTECT study in the second half of 2023.
On July 2, 2021, the FDA issued a CRL for teplizumab’s BLA for the delay of clinical T1D in at-risk individuals. The CRL did not cite any clinical deficiencies related to the efficacy and safety data packages submitted to the BLA. However, pharmacokinetic (PK) drug product comparability considerations remain outstanding, according to a statement released by Provention. In September 2021, Prevention disclosed that it had completed the collection of data from a PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) sub-study in the ongoing PROTECT Phase 3 trial in newly diagnosed T1D patients. 
In July 2021, Provention announced that teplizumab was awarded an Innovation Passport for the delay of clinical T1D in at-risk individuals. 
On February 22, 2022, Provention announced that it had resubmitted the BLA for teplizumab for the delay of clinical T1D in at-risk individuals. Provention indicated that the purpose of the resubmission was to address the FDA's PK comparability considerations contained in the CRL, as well as the CRL's Chemical, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) and product quality considerations. The BLA resubmission followed Provention’s Type B meeting with the FDA earlier in the year.
PRV-3279 
In 2018, we also entered into a license agreement with Provention pursuant to which we granted them exclusive global rights for the purpose of developing and commercializing PRV-3279 (formerly MGD010), a CD32B × CD79B DART molecule being developed for the treatment of autoimmune indications. Provention is initially developing PRV-3279 for the interception of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by an abnormal overactivation of B cells and subsequent pathologic production of auto-antibodies. Provention has disclosed that it believes PRV-3279 also has the potential to prevent or reduce the immunogenicity of biotherapeutics, including but not limited to gene therapy vectors and transgenes. In January 2022, Provention announced the initiation of the Phase 2a PREVAIL-2 study of PRV-3279 in SLE patients. Provention has indicated that it expects to report data from PREVAIL-2 in the first half of 2024.
HIV DART Molecules
We are developing MGD014 and MGD020 under a contract awarded to us in September 2015 by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. These bispecific DART molecules are designed to target the viral envelope (Env) protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected cells and CD3 on T cells to redirect the immune system's T cells to kill HIV-infected cells. These molecules may become a key part of a strategy to reduce or eliminate latent HIV reservoirs in conjunction with latency-reversing agents currently under development. MGD014 and MGD020 target the gp120 and gp41 subunits of HIV Env, respectively. A Phase 1 study of MGD014 in persons with HIV maintained on antiretroviral therapy has been completed and a Phase 1 study of MGD020 alone and combined with MGD014 will initiate in 2022. 
Our Therapeutic Area Focus: Cancer
Cancer is a broad group of diseases in which cells divide and grow in an uncontrolled manner, forming malignancies that can invade other parts of the body. In normal tissues, the rates of new cell growth and cell death are tightly regulated and kept in balance. In cancerous tissues, this balance is disrupted as a result of mutations, causing unregulated cell division or proliferation that leads to tumor formation and growth. While tumors can grow slowly or rapidly, the dividing cells will 
nevertheless accumulate, and the normal organization of the tissue will become disrupted. Cancers subsequently can spread throughout the body by processes known as invasion and metastasis. Once cancer spreads to sites beyond the primary tumor, it generally becomes more difficult to treat and may be incurable. Cancer cells that arise in the lymphatic system and bone marrow are referred to as hematological malignancies. Cancer cells that arise in other tissues or organs are referred to as solid tumors. Cancer can arise in virtually any part of the body, with the most common types arising in the prostate gland, breast, lung, colon and skin. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease. An increasing number of people are also living longer with cancer. 
We believe that our platforms position us very well strategically to actively develop approaches for the treatment of both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.
Our Platforms and Technology Expertise
We apply our understanding of disease biology, immune-mediated mechanisms and next generation antibody technologies to design specifically targeted antibody-based product candidates based on our DART and Fc Optimization platforms. Through these platforms we have designed antibody-based product candidates that have the potential to improve on standard treatments by having one or more of the following attributes: (1) multiple specificities; (2) increased abilities to interact with the body's immune system to fight tumors; (3) capacity to bind more avidly to antigen targets: (4) increased potency; (5) reduced immunogenicity or (6) the ability to target and kill cancer cells that are resistant to standard treatments. Moreover, these technology platforms are complementary and can be combined to address the complex biology of cancer.
DART and TRIDENT Platforms: Our Proprietary Approach to Engineer Multi-Specific Antibodies
We use our DART platform to create derivatives of antibodies with the ability to bind to two distinct targets instead of a single one found in traditional monoclonal antibodies. DART product candidates are therefore bispecific. An example of a bispecific molecule from our DART platform is illustrated below:
Because cancer cells have developed ways to escape the immune system, we have created DART molecules, which are alternative antibody-like structures with more potent immune properties than the parent antibody molecules from which they are derived. The two variable regions of an antibody are mono-specific and are able to target only a single type structural component of an antigen. For many years, researchers have sought to create recombinant molecules that are capable of targeting two antigens or epitopes (i.e., specific part of an antigen bound by the antibody) within the same molecule. The challenges in creating such molecules have been the instability of the resulting bispecific molecules and their inherently short half-lives, as well as the inefficiencies in manufacturing these compounds. We believe our DART platform has overcome these engineering challenges by incorporating proprietary covalent di-sulfide linkages and particular amino acid sequences that efficiently pair the chains of the DART molecule. This is designed to provide a structure with enhanced manufacturability, long-term structural stability and the ability to tailor the half-lives of the DART molecules to their clinical needs. This engineered antibody-like protein has a compact and stable structure and enables the targeting of two different antigens with a single recombinant molecule.
The DART platform has been specifically engineered to accommodate virtually any variable region sequence with predictable expression, folding and antigen recognition. We believe our multi-specific platforms may provide a significant advantage over current biological interventions in cancer, autoimmune disorders and infectious disease by enabling a range of modalities, including those described below.
Our DART platform enables us to design multi-specific molecules that seek to exploit different mechanisms of action, including those set forth below.
•Redirected T cell activation and killing. In this version of the DART molecule, we are engaging the cancer-fighting properties of the immune effector cells, such as T lymphocytes to: (1) recognize and bind to proteins expressed on a cancer cell, or tumor associated antigens (e.g., CD123), (2) enable the recruitment of all types of cytotoxic, or cell killing, T cells, irrespective of their ability to recognize cancer cells (e.g., CD3, a common component of the T cell antigen receptor) and (3) trigger T cell activation, expansion, and cell killing mechanisms to destroy a cancer cell. The outcome is that any of the body's T cells, in theory, could be recruited to destroy a cancer cell and thus, are not limited to the small numbers of specific T cells that might have been generated in response to cancer to kill tumor cells. Furthermore, given the design of a DART molecule, since any T cell could be recruited for this killing process, relatively small amounts of a DART molecule may be required to trigger this potent immune response. Additionally, the compact structure of the DART protein makes it well suited for maintaining cell-to-cell contact, which we believe contributes to the high level of target cell killing. Our DART molecules that redirect T cells against cancer or other targets, including MGD024, are manufactured using a conventional antibody platform without the complexity of having to genetically modify T cells from individual patients, as would be required by approaches such as CAR T cells. We have continued to evolve our bispecific platform with the introduction of a next-generation CD3-engaging DART technology designed to recruit, engage and activate T cells to kill tumor target cells with reduced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This next-generation CD3 DART platform is aimed at addressing cytokine-release syndrome, the most frequent and often dose-limiting adverse event associated with CD3-engaging molecules. We believe the next-generation CD3 DART platform could expand the therapeutic window of CD3-engaing DART molecules and further increase their potential application in oncology.
• Targeting of multiple co-inhibitory receptors or checkpoints, such as those involved in inhibiting T cell responses. The immune system generally prevents the development of autoimmune phenomena by regulating activated immune cells that have responded to non-self or foreign antigens. This negative feedback loop is triggered by the interactions of co-inhibitory receptors, or checkpoint molecules, expressed on the immune cells with ligands expressed by other cells, such as antigen-presenting cells. This phenomenon is exploited by cancer, whereby tumor cells express checkpoint ligands that block the development of an immune response against the tumor. Antibodies that block the interaction of checkpoint molecules with their ligands have been shown to significantly improve the clinical outcomes of patients with certain advanced cancers. Because of the diversity of immune checkpoint pathways, blockade of a single axis, while clinically significant, as shown in the case of the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with pembrolizumab or nivolumab, will not benefit all patients. In fact, combinations of checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, a CTLA-4 blocker, have resulted in significantly enhanced benefit compared to ipilimumab or nivolumab alone. We believe that DART molecules targeting two immunoregulatory pathways, such as two checkpoints in a single molecule, could afford the clinical benefit of the combination together with the potential for synergistic activity, as well as significant advantages in manufacturing, simplified clinical development, and enhanced patient convenience. 

In addition to the ability to tailor a DART molecule's valency, we have the capacity to modify the strength by which the binding sites attach to their targets and the molecule's half-life in the blood circulation after delivery to a patient. Furthermore, when an Fc domain is coupled with a DART molecule, additional changes can be included that can modulate the DART molecule's engagement with different immune cells.
We are currently developing specific product candidates using this technology, including lorigerlimab, MGD024, tebotelimab, and MGD014 in clinical trials, as well as others in preclinical development. 
We have also advanced beyond our DART platform to establish a TRIDENT platform, which reflects the continuing evolution of our multi-specific antibody-based targeting expertise. Built on the DART module, the trivalent TRIDENT platform 
incorporates in an Ig-like format an additional domain capable of engaging an independent antigen. With the inclusion of a third targeting arm, TRIDENT molecules enable a broader range of mechanisms of action than bispecific targeting, allowing, for instance, the engagement of multiple antigens on a single or on different cells or enabling enhanced target selectivity by modulating the avidity of one of two antigens. Product candidates using this technology are currently in preclinical development.
Fc Optimization Platform: Our Proprietary Approach to Enhance Immune-Mediated Cancer Cell Killing
To enhance the body's immune ability, we developed our Fc Optimization platform which introduces certain mutations into the Fc region of an antibody and is able to modulate antibody interaction with immune effector cells. Such interaction enhances the body's immune ability to mediate the killing of cancer cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
ADCC

The Fc region mediates the function of IgG antibodies by binding to different activating and inhibitory receptors, referred to as FcγRs, on immune effector cells found within the innate immune system. By engineering Fc regions to bind with an increased affinity to the activating FcγRs and with a reduced affinity to the inhibitory FcγRs, we have been able to impart a more effective immune response and improve effector functions, such as ADCC. This is another example in which small changes in antibody structure can confer improvements on normal immune processes.
We have established a proprietary platform to engineer, screen, identify and test antibodies' Fc regions with customizable activity. In particular, we have licenses to use transgenic mice that express human FcγRs. These mice can be used for in vivo testing of antibodies that incorporate Fc domain variants, including those antibodies intended for cancer therapy.
To date, we have successfully incorporated our Fc variants in two of our antibody-based molecules, margetuximab and enoblituzumab. In vitro, the modified Fc region of margetuximab increases binding to the activating Fc receptor FCGR3A (CD16A) and decreases binding to the inhibitor Fc receptor FCGR2B (CD32B). These changes lead to greater in vitro ADCC and NK cell activation. The clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown.
Our Collaborations
Throughout our company's history, we have entered into collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies and plan to continue to do so. We enter into collaborations when there is a strategic advantage to us and when we believe the financial terms of the collaboration are favorable for meeting our short-term and long-term strategic objectives. We are not dependent upon any one of these collaborations, but in many cases we have rights to receive sales royalties and other significant financial payments if the partnered product candidates achieve certain development and sales milestones. We endeavor to establish collaborations that preserve our right to participate in future commercialization, for example by securing co-promotion or profit-sharing rights under certain circumstances.
We pursue a balanced approach between product candidates that we develop ourselves and those that we develop with our collaborators. Under our strategic collaborations to date, we have received significant non-dilutive funding and continue to have rights to additional funding upon completion of certain research, achievement of key product development milestones and royalties and other payments upon the commercial sale of products. Each of our collaborations has a unique set of terms and conditions.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to protect, for example, the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, the technology platforms used to generate them, related technologies and/or other aspects of the inventions that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business. In addition, there is cost and risk to our business in defending and enforcing our patents, maintaining our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties and preserving the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operating without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary positions. We currently use multiple industry-standard patent monitoring systems to monitor new United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) filings for any applications by third parties that may infringe on our patents.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
A third party may hold patents or other intellectual property rights that are important to or necessary for the development of our product candidates or use of our technology platforms. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. For example, certain patents held by third parties cover Fc engineering methods and mutations in Fc regions to enhance the binding of Fc regions to Fc receptors on immune cells. Although we believe that these patents are not infringed, invalid, and unenforceable, should a court find that they cover margetuximab or enoblituzumab and we are unable to invalidate them, or if licenses for them are not available on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, perhaps materially.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions can be maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention. In the ordinary course of business we participate in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, that challenge the patentability of third party patents. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
Pipeline Patent Protection
As of December 31, 2021, we held 88 patents in the United States with 46 patent applications pending and 814 patents in other countries of the world with 569 patent applications pending. In addition to patents and patent applications generally providing protection for various aspects of our Fc Optimization, DART, and TRIDENT platforms, we have patent and patent applications for the composition of matter of each of our clinical pipeline product candidates and, in some cases, we also have other patents and patent application related to various aspects of the technology underlying these product candidates or their methods of use.
Patent terms may be adjusted or extended, as described in greater detail below, in certain circumstances. However, assuming no adjustments or extensions, the primary composition of matter patent for each of our clinical pipeline product candidates is expected to expire in the following timeframes:

Product or Product Candidate | Expiration Date
margetuximab | 2029 
enoblituzumab | 2031 
retifanlimab | 2036 
tebotelimab | 2036* 
lorigerlimab | 2036* 
MGC018 | 2037* 
MGD024 | 2039* 

* pending
Patent Term Extension and Reference Product Exclusivity
The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs, including biological products, of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA approval, we have applied or expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek, and are seeking, patent term extensions to our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively the ACA) created a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars via an abbreviated licensure pathway. In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. Under the ACA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is "biosimilar to" or "interchangeable with" a previously approved biological product or "reference product." The "biosimilar" application must include specific information demonstrating biosimilarity based on data derived from: (1) analytical studies, (2) animal studies, and (3) a clinical study or studies that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed, except that FDA may waive some of these requirements for a given application. Under this new statutory scheme, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years after the date of first licensure. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biological products. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor's own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. There have been recent proposals to repeal or modify the ACA and it is uncertain how any of those proposals, if approved, would affect these provisions.
Trade Secrets
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions.
In-Licensed Intellectual Property
We have entered into patent and know-how license agreements that grant us the rights to use certain technologies related to biological manufacturing for our clinical product candidates. We anticipate using these technologies for future product candidates. These licensors have businesses dedicated to licensing this type of technology and we anticipate that licenses to use these technologies for our future products will be available. The licenses typically include yearly maintenance payments and sales royalties, and may also include upfront payments or milestone payments.
Manufacturing
We currently manufacture drug substance for most of our clinical trials at our manufacturing facilities located in Rockville, Maryland. We also rely on contract manufacturers, primarily Byondis, for production components of one of our ADC candidates. We have supplemented our drug substance manufacturing capacity through an arrangement with AGC Biologics, Inc. (AGC, formerly CMC Biologics, Inc.), a contract manufacturing organization, and commercially produced initial margetuximab commercial supply and inventory at AGC. In October 2021, the FDA approved the BLA supplement to add our commercial manufacturing site at 9704 Medical Center Drive in Rockville, Maryland as a licensed manufacturing site for margetuximab drug substance. We intend to commercially produce material for MARGENZA, as well as our and partner’s product candidates when and if approved by the FDA. In addition, we currently rely on and will continue to rely on contract fill-finish service providers, primarily Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, to fulfill our fill-finish needs for our current and future product candidates.
Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However, we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source. In the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product, we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented. However, in the event of an extended failure of a supplier or general national supply chain disruption, it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or, in some cases, implemented alternative processes.
Production processes for biological therapeutic products are complex, highly regulated, and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures, process modifications, and regulatory approvals. Accordingly, if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities, extended failure of a contract supplier or contract manufacturing organization, or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand, we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded.
Commercialization
MARGENZA is currently our only approved product in the U.S. In November 2020, we partnered with Eversana, a pioneer of next-generation commercial services to the global life sciences industry, to commercialize margetuximab in the U.S. by leveraging their integrated commercial services. Under the terms of the agreement, we maintain ownership of margetuximab, including all manufacturing, regulatory and development responsibilities for the product. Eversana received a co-exclusive right to conduct approved commercialization activities. Eversana utilizes its internal capabilities to support sales and marketing, market access, channel management services, data and analytics, medical affairs, and other patient access related services; we book MARGENZA sales. We and Eversana equally share in funding Eversana’s commercialization expenses. In exchange for co-funding these expenses, Eversana is eligible to earn future revenue share payments which shall be capped at 125% of Eversana’s cumulative service fees. The term of the agreement is five years following the date of FDA approval, subject to predefined termination provisions.
We cannot market or promote a new product in a country until a marketing application has been approved by the appropriate regulatory authority for that jurisdiction. Subject to receiving marketing authorization in a jurisdiction, we believe we will be able to commercialize in that market through arrangements with third-party commercial partners. Other than through our arrangement with Eversana for MARGENZA, we have not established a sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. If we are unable to enter into third-party commercial arrangements for other product candidates with respect to the United States, we believe that we could potentially put in place an appropriately sized organization to commercialize our approved product or products. Outside the United States, our strategy is to enter into arrangements with third-party commercial partners for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval.
Competition
There are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These treatments consist both of small molecule drug products, as well as biologic therapeutics that work by using next-generation antibody technology platforms to address specific cancer targets. In 
particular, MARGENZA is directed against HER2 and many companies have cancer therapeutics directed against HER2 that are either currently approved and on the market or may be in development, such as F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche), particularly through its affiliate, Genentech, Inc., as well as Puma Biotechnology, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited and AstraZeneca plc. (AstraZeneca), Seagen Inc., Zymeworks, Inc., Shanghai Hengrui Pharmaceutical, and Byondis, many of which have significantly greater resources than we do. Market competition has limited the utilization of MARGENZA as a therapeutic, and these competitors as well as biosimilar trastuzumab competition may limit such utilization in the future.
In addition, the immuno-oncology field is competitive, with treatments currently approved and, on the market, or in development for various tumor types and patient populations from a variety of different companies such as Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), and Roche, all of which have significantly greater resources than we do. Many of our pipeline programs, if successful, will likely face significant competition both by therapeutics that are already being marketed as well as those that will be approved for marketing before our programs. In particular, we are developing PD-1-directed product candidates, including a monoclonal antibody that we have outlicensed and two DART molecules. Merck, BMS, Roche, AstraZeneca, Pfizer Inc., Merck KGaA, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. all have approved products that target either the PD-1 receptor or its ligand, PD-L1, and there are several other companies that have anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies in clinical development, all of which would compete with our PD-1-directed programs. In addition, these and other companies are developing product candidates directed against other immuno-oncology targets that we are pursuing through our bispecific approaches.
Finally, several companies are also developing therapeutics that work by targeting multiple specificities using a single recombinant molecule. Amgen Inc. has obtained marketing approval for one product that works by targeting antigens both on immune effector cell populations and those expressed on certain cancer cells, and has other product candidates in development that use this mechanism. In addition, other companies are developing new treatments for cancer that utilize multi-specific approaches, including Abbvie Inc., Affimed N.V., Eli Lilly and Company, Genmab A/S, Merus B.V., Regeneron, Roche, AstraZeneca, Xencor, Inc. and Zymeworks, Inc.
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic or biosimilar competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. In addition, the standard of medical care provided to cancer patients continues to evolve as more scientific and medical information becomes available. These changes in medical care relate to pharmaceutical products, but are also affected by other factors, and such changes can positively or negatively affect the prospects of our product candidates as well as those of our competitors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop, or the standards of care for cancer patients change while our clinical trials are ongoing. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of biosimilar products. Biosimilar products are expected to become available over the coming years. For example, trastuzumab biosimilars have been approved in the U.S. by the FDA.
The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates may compete with many existing drug and other therapies, to the extent an approved drug is ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates will not be competitive with the approved drug.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, pricing, reimbursement, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Regulation
All of our current product candidates are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA as biological products (biologics). The FDA subjects biologics to extensive pre- and post-market regulation. The Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of biologics. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending BLAs, withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal penalties.
Preclinical Studies. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky; failure rates are high. Product development cycles are long - approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new biological product must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish it is pure, potent and safe.
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, pharmacology, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including the FDA's good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an IND application with the FDA to begin human testing. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical trial protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND application. Certain preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue even after the IND application is submitted. An IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold or agrees on an alternate approach with us. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the IND application is cleared and the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND application may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Development. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects (healthy volunteers or patients) under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with all applicable federal regulations and guidance, including those pertaining to good clinical practice (GCP) standards that are meant to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of human subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors; as well as (ii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing of a new drug in the United States (whether in patients or healthy volunteers) must be included in the IND application submission, and the FDA must be notified of subsequent protocol amendments. In addition, the protocol must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (IRB) and all study subjects must provide informed consent prior to participating in the study. Typically, each institution participating in the clinical trial will require review of the protocol before any clinical trial commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and there are additional, more frequent reporting requirements for suspected unexpected serious adverse events.
A study sponsor might choose to discontinue a clinical trial or a clinical development program for a variety of reasons. The FDA may impose a temporary or permanent clinical hold, or other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three pre-approval phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined, particularly in testing for oncology indications. In Phase 1, testing is conducted in a small group of subjects who may be patients with the target disease or condition or healthy volunteers, to evaluate its safety, 
determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. In Phase 2, the drug is given to a larger group of subjects with the target condition to further evaluate its safety and gather preliminary evidence of efficacy. Phase 3 studies typically last multiple years for oncology indications. In Phase 3, the drug is given to a large group of subjects with the target disease or condition (several hundred to several thousand), often at multiple geographical sites, to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, and collect data to support drug approval. In some cases, the FDA may require post-market studies, known as Phase 4 studies, to be conducted as a condition of approval in order to gather additional information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Depending on the risks posed by the drugs, other post-market requirements may be imposed. Only a small percentage of investigational drugs complete all three phases and obtain marketing approval.
Product Approval. After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA can be prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and annual program user fees also apply. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review, and the review period under the PDUFA begins. The standard for reviewing a BLA is whether the product is safe, pure and potent, which has been interpreted to include that the product is safe and effective and has a favorable benefit-risk profile. The FDA's current performance goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90 percent of standard (non-priority) BLAs within 10 months of filing and within six months for priority BLAs, which is 12 months and eight months, respectively, if the 60-day review of the initial application is included in the timeline. In addition, the FDA has developed approaches intended to make certain qualifying products available to patients rapidly - Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, and Fast Track. While the timelines for approval under these pathways may be shorter, there are requirements and conditions associated with each pathway, and there can be no assurance that any of our investigational products will be able to meet the conditions or requirements necessary to receive any such designation or be able to receive the review or approval benefits associated with such designations. 
The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes outside clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether sufficient data exist in the application to support product approval. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally gives significant deference to such recommendations.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites and possibly the sponsor itself to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) is satisfactory. The FDA also reviews the proposed labeling submitted with the BLA and typically requires changes in the labeling text.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing and testing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. Complete response letters generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and delineate the additional testing or information needed in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when deficiencies outlined in a complete response letter have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing 90 percent of resubmissions within two or six months from receipt depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for the approved indication or indications and the other conditions of use set out in the approved prescribing information. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions that can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. As a condition of approval, or after approval, the FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS may include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
Other U.S. Post-Marketing Regulatory Requirements. Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements, including those relating to advertising, promotion, adverse event reporting, recordkeeping, and 
cGMPs, as well as registration, listing, and inspection. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA regulates the content and format of prescription drug labeling, advertising, and promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising and promotional Internet communications. The FDA also establishes parameters for permissible non-promotional communications between industry and the medical community, including industry-supported scientific and educational activities. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion for uses not consistent with the approved labeling, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses or otherwise not to have met applicable promotion rules may be subject to significant liability under both the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act. See "Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements" below for more information.
All aspects of pharmaceutical manufacture must conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the FDA inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs.
Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, product formulation or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, in some cases before the change may be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
Manufacturers are subject to requirements for adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports following FDA approval of a BLA. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, or failure of Phase 4 studies to meet their specified endpoints, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, the need to conduct additional post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program, or recall of the product and withdrawal of the BLA.
Noncompliance with post-marketing requirements can result in one or more of the following consequences:
•Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•Warning letters;
•Holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•Refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Approval of Biosimilars. The ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. The law establishes a period of 12 years of exclusivity for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation, and outlines statutory criteria for science-based biosimilar approval standards that take into account patient safety considerations. Under this framework, exclusivity protects innovator products by prohibiting others, for a period of 12 years, from being granted FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the innovator's data in their application to the FDA. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biological products. There are regular legislative 
proposals to rescind or reduce the biologics exclusivity provisions of the ACA and it is uncertain whether or if any of those proposals may be approved, and if approved, how exclusivity for biologics would be affected. 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
We are be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations,guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under such anti-kickback laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).
Laws and regulations enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers and/or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent laws and regulations.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we and our collaborators, may be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, drug registration, commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates outside the United States. These regulations can vary between jurisdictions and can be more onerous than regulations in the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union (EU) before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (CTA) much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP, and other applicable regulatory requirements. A separate CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to be conducted.
In the EU, for example, to obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product, we must submit a marketing authorisation application (MAA). The content of the MAA is similar to that of a New Drug Application or BLA filed in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, EU-specific document requirements. Under the EU regulatory system, a company may submit marketing authorisation applications either under a centralised or decentralised procedure. Under the centralised procedure in the EU, a MAA is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The maximum timeframe for a CHMP evaluation of an MAA that has been validated is 210 days, excluding time taken by an applicant to respond to questions. A favorable opinion on the application by the CHMP will typically result in the granting of the marketing authorisation by the European Commission within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. Generally, the entire review process takes approximately 13-14 months. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding time taken by an applicant to respond to questions.
As in the United States, we or our collaborators may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the MAA is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy certain benefits, including up to 10 years of exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product. The PRIME initiative was established by the EMA to help promote and foster the development of new medicines in the EU that demonstrate potential for a major therapeutic advantage in areas of unmet medical need. Benefits from the PRIME designation include early confirmation of potential for 
accelerated assessment, early dialogue and increased interaction with relevant regulatory committees to discuss development options, scientific advice at key development milestones, and proactive regulatory support from the EMA.
If we, or our collaborators, fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
BioPharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
In the United States and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Third-party reimbursement adequate to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development may not be available or optimal for our products.
Drug prices have become a subject of increased focus in recent years. Although there are currently no direct government price controls over private sector purchases in the U.S., federal law requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay prescribed rebates on certain government or Medicaid-reimbursed drugs to enable them to be eligible for reimbursement under certain public healthcare programs such as Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Various states have adopted further mechanisms that seek to control drug prices, including by disfavoring certain higher priced drugs or by seeking supplemental rebates from manufacturers. Managed care has also become a potent force in the marketplace that increases downward pressure on the prices of pharmaceutical products.
Public and private healthcare payers control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payers also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 427 full-time employees, 355 of whom were primarily engaged in research, development and manufacturing activities, and 77 of whom had an M.D. and/or Ph.D. Our employees are critically important to the achievement of our company’s mission and goals. We periodically conduct employee engagement surveys to understand our employees’ perspectives and endeavor to listen, change and improve on how we work together in response to these perspectives. We face significant competition for experienced and talented individuals in our area due to the growth of local companies. We monitor our compensation, benefits, and exit interview data and make changes as needed to enable the ongoing recruitment and selection of talented new employees, as well as to retain existing talent. We strive to offer our employees an intellectually challenging and diverse work environment, opportunities to expand their knowledge and skills, to receive feedback on performance, and for career advancement. Our Living Values, which focus on patients, honest and transparent communications, innovation, ethics, collaboration, our sense of urgency, getting results, and valuing diversity and striving for inclusion set the tone for how we work together.
We empowered a cross-functional team in the early days of the ongoing pandemic to recommend safety protocols, ensure timely communications, and make decisions related to the effect of COVID-19 on our employees and work environment. We believe management’s relationships with our employees is very positive and they are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union.
