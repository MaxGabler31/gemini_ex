Business Overview
 
PDF Solutions is a leading provider of electrical characterization and data analytics for process-design optimization and yield enhancement to improve our customers’ profitability. Our solutions target the value chain from technology development and the design of an integrated circuit (or IC) through volume manufacturing of that IC. Our solutions combine proprietary software, physical intellectual property (or IP) in the form of on-wafer instruments and cell libraries for IC designs, contact and non-contact electrical measurement tools, proven methodologies, and professional services. We generate and analyze electrical characterization data to optimize process, design, and fabrication of semiconductor devices for high yield, low cost, and high performance. We monetize our solutions through contract revenue, a value-based royalty that we call a Gainshare performance incentive, and software and hardware licensing. The result of successfully implementing our solutions is the creation of value that can be measured in terms of higher yield, lower cost, and improved IC device and manufacturing performance. Our technologies and services have been sold to integrated device manufacturers, fabless semiconductor companies, foundries, out-sourced semiconductor assembly and test (or OSAT), and system houses.
  
The key benefits of our solutions and business model to our customers are faster time-to-market, faster time-to-volume and more efficient design and manufacturing processes. For example, our foundry customers are able to generate and analyze key manufacturing data using either our Design-for-Inspection (or DFI) or Integrated Yield Ramp (or IYR) solutions to shorten the time necessary for technology development and provide their fabless customers a higher yielding process, with improved electrical performance, sooner, which increases fabless customer acquisition. Also, for example, our integrated device manufacturers (or IDMs) and fabless customers might use our DFI and Design-for-Manufacturability (or DFM) solution to generate and analyze data to bridge the design and manufacturing interface, resulting in shorter time for initial designs to meet performance requirements with fewer iterations and faster time to market for new designs. Our data analytics, including for process control and assembly and test, are designed to provide insight across the whole electronic supply chain. For example, our customers can gain insight into factors that affect yield and device performance at mass production through final packaging, thus enabling a lower total cost of goods sold. For further example, our volume manufacturing solution may provide a foundry customer with the ability to proactively monitor process health to avoid potential yield problems. Fabless customers also benefit from an integrated insight into their supply chain effectiveness.

Our long-term business objective is to enable our customers to optimize their processes, designs, and fabrication for high yield, low cost, and high performance, and to be the big data analytics supplier of choice for the electronic supply chain. To achieve this objective, we intend to:


● | Position for DFI Success. We intend to demonstrate and validate the value of our DFI solution by expanding its use in both process development and volume production. We expect to achieve this by increasing the installed base of our first-generation, contactless measurement tool in our foundry customers’ early R&D programs and drive insertion of our on-chip instruments at an increasing number of IDM and fabless companies, on an increasing number of designs. For example, through the date of this report, we have received orders and deployed our DFI eProbe® 150 tool systems at three logic foundry customers and DFI on-chip instruments have been placed in over 100 customers’ chips at the 28 nanometer (nm) through 7 nm foundry logic process nodes. Finally, we intend to expand our DFI product offering with the introduction of the second-generation measurement tool targeted for in-line applications.

● | Broaden Footprint at Existing Software Customers and Expand Software Market Opportunity. We intend to increase the breadth and depth of the use of our software applications by demonstrating additional value-add opportunities at existing customers. For example, we intend to continue to develop and enhance our big data analytics capability to further extract unique electrical characterization data in our yield ramp engagements for our IYR customers. Additionally, we intend to expand the market opportunity vertically by developing new data sources and applications for our Exensio platform. This expansion up the semiconductor supply chain is designed to enable new data sources and application capability to system level designers and product managers. For example, in 2017, the acquisition of the ALPS software enabled us to analyze die-level traceability as an additional data source at the package level.

● | Align IYR Business Model and Costs to Changing Market Conditions. We intend to expand adoption of our IYR solutions on derivative processes of existing technology, mainstream foundries, and memory applications. Market factors driving this business strategy include the slowing rate at which advanced nodes are introduced and reduced capacities related to those nodes, introduction and expansion of 3-D memory technologies, and continuing concentration in both the foundry and fabless sides of the industry. We intend to focus on new entrants into the foundry and memory markets, in particular in China. This is aimed at taking advantage of increasing investments in China in the semiconductor market. For example, in 2017, we entered into a new engagement with a 3-D memory foundry in China.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expand Ecosystem. We intend to continue to extend and enhance our relationships with companies at various stages of the design-to-silicon process, such as process licensors, manufacturing and test equipment vendors, electronic design automation vendors, silicon IP providers, semiconductor foundries, and contract test and assembly houses. We believe these relationships will ultimately enhance the value and utility our solutions and help drive standardization on PDF Solutions technology. 

Brief History
 
PDF Solutions was incorporated in Pennsylvania in November 1992, and we reincorporated in California in November 1995. In July 2000, we reincorporated in Delaware, and in July 2001, we completed an initial public offering. Our shares of common stock are currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Market. From 2000 through 2009, we expanded our technology footprint and our operations in various countries through acquisitions. From 2009 to the present, we have primarily focused on the pervasive application of our technology to leading edge logic manufacturing and achieving yield targets with our clients to maximize Gainshare performance incentive revenues. Beginning in 2013, we leveraged our more than 20 years of yield simulation software and Characterization Vehicle test chip development and began new research and development on a solution for contactless in-line electrical characterization and process control for wafer inspection. Starting in 2014, we re-architected our point-solution software tools into an integrated platform based on new generation data analytics and introduced our Exensio platform to the industry. In 2016, the first version of our e-beam tool was commercialized, and we are currently focused on completing development and commercialization of the second version. Headquartered in San Jose, California, PDF Solutions operates worldwide with another principal office in Shanghai, China and additional entities and/or offices in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.

Industry Background
 
Rapid technological innovation, with increasingly shorter product life cycles, now fuels the economic growth of the semiconductor industry. IC companies have historically ramped production slowly, produced at high volume once products gained market acceptance, and slowly reduced production volume when price and demand started to decrease near the end of the products’ life cycles. Now, companies often need to be the first to market and the first to sell the most volume when a product is first introduced so that they have performance and pricing advantages over their competition, or else they lose market opportunity and revenue. Increased IC complexity and compressed product lifecycles create significant challenges to achieve competitive initial yields and optimized performance. For example, it is not uncommon for an initial manufacturing run to yield only 20%, which means that 80% of the ICs produced are wasted. Yield improvement performance optimization and production efficiencies are critical drivers of IC companies’ financial results, because they typically lead to cost reduction and revenue generation concurrently, causing a leveraged effect on profitability. 
Technology and Intellectual Property Protection
 
We have developed proprietary technologies for yield simulation, analysis, loss detection, and improvement. The foundation for many of our solutions is our CV® infrastructure (or CVi) that enables our customers to electrically characterize the manufacturing process, and establish fail-rate information needed to calibrate manufacturing yield models, prioritize yield improvement activities and speed-up process learning-cycles. Our CVi includes proprietary Characterization Vehicle®test chips, including designs of experiments and layout designs, and a proprietary and patented highly-parallel contact electrical functional and parametric-test system, comprised of hardware and software designed to provide an order-of-magnitude reduction in the time required to test our Characterization Vehicle® test chips. Our DFI solution includes physical IP in the form of test structures specifically designed by our engineers for targeted fail modes and co-optimized to be efficiently measured by our non-contact electrical measurement tool both in test chips, including in scribe lines, and in the fill area of production wafers. In addition, our technology embodies many algorithms, which we have developed over the course of many years, and which are implemented in our products including Exensio®, pdCV™, FIRE™, and Templatyzer™, among others. For a description of these products, see Products and Services below. Further, our IP includes methodologies that our implementation teams use as guidelines to drive our customers’ use of our CV® test chips DFI solution, and technologies, quantify the yield-loss associated with each process module and design block, make wafer disposition decisions, control process equipment, simulate the impact of changes to the design and/or to the manufacturing process, and/or analyze the outcome of executing such changes. We continually enhance our core technologies through the codification of knowledge that we gain in our solution implementations.
  
Our future success and competitive position rely to some extent upon our ability to protect these proprietary technologies and IP, to generate revenue for customers’ use of our solutions, and to prevent competitors from using our systems, methods, and technologies in their products. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures, trade secrets, and patent, copyright, mask work, and trademark laws. We license our products and technologies pursuant to non-exclusive license agreements that impose restrictions on customers’ use. In addition, we seek to avoid disclosure of our trade secrets, including requiring employees, customers, and others with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and restricting access to our source code. We also seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. We seek to protect our IP under patent laws and as of December 31, 2017, we held 113 U.S. patents. Our issued patents have expiration dates from 2019 through 2037. We intend to prepare additional patent applications when we feel it is beneficial. We also employ protection of our trademarks, with registration on marks including Characterization Vehicle®, CV®, eProbe®, Exensio®, pdFasTest®, PDF Solutions®, the PDF Solutions logo. ALPS™, Design-to-silicon-yield™, Design-for-Inspection™, DFI™, DirectProbe™, DirectScan™, FIRE™, pdCV™, Template™, Templatyzer™, and YieldAware™ are our common law trademarks of PDF Solutions or its subsidiaries.
  
Products and Services
 
Through organic development and targeted acquisitions over more than 20 years, we have accumulated an array of fully-integrated and co-designed proprietary software, physical IP for IC designs, electrical measurement tools, and proven methodologies. Subsets of this array are selected to address each customer’s specific technical and business requirements. For example, a fabless customer designing a new product may use our proprietary on-wafer instruments and cell libraries design physical IP to enhance their design for manufacturability. In contrast, an IYR solution on a leading edge process node for a device manufacturer foundry may include our electrical characterization infrastructure, analysis tools, and professional services to accelerate learning and reduce time-to-market. By way of another example, a fabless company in volume manufacturing may use our data analytic software tools, which are also available to their foundry partners, to monitor how the fabless’ designs are performing at their foundry partners. The following gives more information about our services and solutions and products.

Volume Manufacturing Solutions (or VMS).  Our Exensio® volume manufacturing solutions are designed to link the critical data streams from the entire manufacturing process, from bare wafer to packaged part or system; to improve yield and provide both better operational and process control of tools and testers. The systems also maintain comprehensive traceability from starting wafer through to final packaged part or system. When used in conjunction with our Characterization Vehicle infrastructure, our Exensio software and services enable customers to correlate the proprietary CVi data generated with high granularity manufacturing data also generated, to improve yield while simultaneously reducing the overhead of manufacturing.
 
Manufacturing Process Solutions ( or MPS).  The IC manufacturing process typically involves four sequential phases: research and development to establish unit manufacturing processes, such as units for the metal CMP or lithography processes; integration of these unit processes into functional modules, such as metal or contact modules; a yield ramp of lead products through the entire manufacturing line; and volume manufacturing of all products through the life of the process. We offer solutions targeted to each of these phases designed to accelerate the efficiency of yield learning by shortening the learning cycle, learning more per cycle, and reducing the number of silicon wafers required. Our targeted offerings include:
 

• | Process R&D: Our process R&D solutions are designed to help customers increase the robustness of their manufacturing processes by characterizing and reducing the variability of unit processes and device performance with respect to layout characteristics within anticipated process design rules. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Process Integration and Yield Ramp: Our process integration and yield ramp solutions are designed to enable our customers to more quickly ramp the yield of new products early in the manufacturing process by characterizing the process-design interactions within each key process module, simulating product yield loss by process module, and prioritizing quantitative yield improvement by design block in real products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Design-for-Manufacturability (or DFM) Solutions.  Our DFM solutions are designed to enable our customers to optimize yields, improve parametric performance, and reduce product ramp time by integrating manufacturability considerations into the design cycle before a design is sent to the mask shop to more quickly and cost-effectively manufacture IC products. We target these solutions to customers’ requirements by providing the following: 
 

• | DFM Solutions: DFM solutions include software, IP, CV infrastructure, and services designed to validate customers’ process design kit (or PDK) and to maximize functional and parametric yield improvements while achieving requirements for density or performance. A CV test chip optimized to the design style of an IC design provides any necessary design-specific parametric and functional yield models for the design style. Our software helps designers optimize the yield by using process-specific and design style-specific yield models and technology files that enable identification and implementation of IP design building block improvements that result in enhanced yield. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Template™ Technology Physical IP Solutions: Template physical IP solutions include Templatyzer software and IP for first identifying and developing a set of layout patterns that are optimized to a given manufacturing process and target product application and second checking proposed product layout designs against this set of patterns for optimal manufacturability. A complete characterization of all transistor and layout patterns used in these Template layouts can be performed with the CV infrastructure. These Template layouts serve as the building blocks for design organizations to construct standard cell libraries and larger physical IP blocks.

Exensio Enterprise-wide Platform. Our Exensio platform addresses the big data manufacturing challenge of today’s advanced process nodes and highly integrated products, by linking across YMS, FDC, test floor, and other enterprise-wide data types. These data types include in-line and end-of-line metrology, yield, parametric, performance, manufacturing consumables, tool-level sensor data, test floor data, logistical data, as well as custom data types. This enables sensor level, root cause diagnosis of yield and performance issues that impact manufacturing, through building process models of these relationships. The on-line models then enable predictive and proactive optimization decisions for process control, process adjustments, PM scheduling, tool corrective actions, wafer dispatching, and wafer level and final test. The in-line, real-time decision-making based on these models is designed to reduce product variability and cost simultaneously. Our Exensio platform also enables more rapid diagnosis and understanding of yield loss and performance-limiting mechanisms identified at both in-line and end-of -line wafer processing, through application of the developed models. The platform currently consists of four main modules in the field today.  These modules can be used separately, or combined to provide seamless integration of these traditionally disparate dataflows and applications.  Additionally, specific Exensio functionality is available as either an on-premise installation or through the software as a service, or SaaS, offering.  
 

● | Exensio -Yield, collects yield data, then loads and stores it in an analysis-ready database. This enables product engineers to identify and analyze production yield, performance, reliability and other issues. The Exensio-Yield module is designed to handle very large data sets, to efficiently improve productivity, yield and time-to-market at our customers’ sites. Exensio-Yield contains powerful, interactive visualization and analysis template capabilities, which provide flexibility to address our customers’ requirements. Exensio-Yield advanced components include extra proprietary yield analysis software tools that aid in the diagnosis of more complex yield issues. This includes defect analysis tools, spatial signature analysis, excursion and event monitoring, workflows, and data-mining capabilities. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exensio -Control, provides FDC capabilities for monitoring, alarming and control of manufacturing tool sets. These capabilities include analyzing tool sensor trace data and summary indicators to rapidly identify sources of process variations and manufacturing excursions. This is achieved by monitoring these equipment parameters through proprietary data collection and analysis features. When included with the above Exensio-Yield module, data mining and correlation capabilities enable identification of tool level sources of yield loss and process variation, that are impacting end of line product yield, performance and reliability.

● | Exensio -Char, encapsulates test structure analysis functionality of both electrical and in-line inspection data from PDF Solutions’ proprietary Characterization Vehicle (CV) test chips and DFI on-chip instruments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exensio ALPS™, provides device manufacturers the capability to link final device performance, both at test and in the field, to the totality of device fabrication and characterization data, including data from our Characterization Vehicle electrical test chip infrastructure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
FIRE Software.  Our FIRE software analyzes an IC design to compute its systematic and random yield loss. FIRE software allows design attribute extraction and feature-based yield modeling. FIRE software takes as input a layout that is typically in industry standard format and proprietary yield models generated by running and testing our CV test chips. FIRE software is designed to estimate the yield loss due to optical proximity effects, etch micro-lading, dishing in CMP, and other basic process issues.
 
Template Technology.  Our Template technology includes Templatyzer software and IP for identifying and developing a set of layout patterns that are tailored to a given manufacturing process and target product application and checking proposed designs against this set of patterns for optimal manufacturability. 
 
With the exception of  Exensio -Yield, Exensio -Control, Exensio -Test, Exensio -Char, and Exensio ALPS, the primary distribution method for our software and technologies is through our manufacturing process solutions. The primary distribution method for Exensio -Yield, Exensio -Control, Exensio -Test, Exensio -Char, and Exensio ALPS is standalone license agreements. However, we have in the past and may in the future distributed some or all of these products within solutions as a bundle, or separately license other products or technologies outside of our solutions.
  
Customers
 
Our existing customers include foundries, integrated device manufacturers (or IDMs), fabless semiconductor design companies, some off-shore assembly and testing facilities (or OSATs), as well as some equipment manufacturers. Our semiconductor customers’ targeted product segments vary significantly, including microprocessors, memory, graphics, image sensor solutions, and communications. Through our acquisition of certain Kinesys assets in 2017, we expanded our customer base to include additional equipment manufacturers that embed and distribute our ALPS product in their equipment. We believe that the adoption of our solutions by such companies for usage in a wide range of products validates the application of our Design-to-silicon-yield solutions to the broader semiconductor market.

Global Foundries Inc. (“Global Foundries”) represented 40% of our revenues for 2017. Global Foundries and Samsung represented 41% and 11%, respectively, of our revenues for 2016. Global Foundries and Samsung represented 53% and 12%, respectively, of our revenues for 2015. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues in 2017, 2016, and 2015.
 
Although a substantial portion of our total revenue is concentrated in a small number of customers, the total revenues for each of these customers in any period is the result of Design-to-silicon-yield solutions and/or Gainshare performance incentives revenues recognized in the period under multiple, separate contracts, with no interdependent performance obligations.  These contracts were all entered into in the ordinary course of our business and contain general terms and conditions that are standard across most of our yield improvement solutions customers, including providing services typically targeted to one manufacturing process node, for example the 28 or 20 nanometer node.   See the discussion in “Risk Factors” under Item 1A for more information about risks associated with customer concentration and contractual provisions. 
  
International revenues accounted for approximately 61% of our total revenues for 2017 compared to 64% for 2016 and 54% for 2015. We base these calculations on the geographic location of where the work is performed. Revenues from customers by geographic area based on the location of the customers’ work sites for our last three fiscal years can be found in Note 9, “Customer and Geographic Information” to the consolidated financial statements. Additional discussion regarding the risks associated with international operations can be found under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.
 
See our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”, included under Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional geographic information.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales strategy is to pursue targeted accounts through a combination of our direct sales force, our solution implementation teams, and strategic alliances. After we are engaged by a customer and early in the solution implementation, our engineers seek to establish relationships in the organization and gain an understanding of our customers’ business issues. Our direct sales and solution implementation teams combine their efforts to deepen our customer relationships by expanding our penetration across the customer’s products, processes and technologies. This close working relationship with the customer has the added benefit of helping us identify new product areas and technologies in which we should next focus our research and development efforts. From time-to-time, we use sales representatives/agents in various locations to augment direct sales in certain territories. For example, in 2017, we engaged Abrolex in China, Recynergy in Taiwan, Tessolve in India and Southeast Asia. We expect to continue to establish strategic alliances with process licensors, vendors in the electronic design automation software, capital equipment for IC production, and test silicon IP and mask-making software segments to create and take advantage of sales channel and co-marketing opportunities. Additionally, we expect to form relationships with key value chain participants, including foundries and OSATs, to provide services and value across the manufacturing supply chain.
Research and Development
 
Our research and development focuses on developing and introducing new proprietary technologies, including our DFI solution as well as other software products and enhancements to our existing solutions. We use a rapid-prototyping paradigm in the context of the customer engagement to achieve these goals. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in research and development. The complexity of our Design-to-silicon-yield technologies requires expertise in physical IC design and layout, transistor design and semiconductor physics, semiconductor process integration, numerical algorithms, e-beam technology, hardware, statistics and software development. We believe that our team of engineers will continue to advance our market and technological leadership. We conduct in-house training for our engineers in the technical areas, as well as focusing on ways to enhance client service skills. Although it fluctuates, we can have up to one quarter of our research and development engineers operating in the field, partnered with solution implementation engineers in a deliberate strategy to provide direct feedback between technology development and customer needs. We also utilize a variety of skilled independent contractors for specialized development. Our total research and development expenses were $30.1 million, $27.6 million and $19.1 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 Competition
 
The semiconductor industry is highly competitive and driven by rapidly changing design and process technologies, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and decreasing prices. We expect market competition to continue to develop and increase as the market for process-design integration technologies and services continues to evolve. We believe the solution to address the needs of IC companies requires a unified system of yield models, design analysis software, CV test chips, physical IP creation, and semiconductor manufacturing software. Currently, we are the leading provider of comprehensive commercial solutions for integrating design and manufacturing processes. We face indirect competition from internal groups at IC companies that use an incomplete set of components not optimized to accelerate process-design integration. Some providers of semiconductor manufacturing software, inspection equipment, electronic design automation, or design IP may seek to broaden their product offerings and compete with us. In each of our product markets, we face competition from established and potential competitors, some of which may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. 
 
We face competition for some of the point applications of our solutions including some of those used by the internal groups at IC companies. Specifically there are several suppliers of (i) yield management and/or prediction systems, such as KLA-Tencor, Mentor Graphics, Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (“Rudolph”), Synopsys, Inc. (“Synopsys”), and Qualtera, (ii) semiconductor manufacturing software, such as Applied Materials, Inc., BISTel Inc., Invantest, Inc., MKS Instruments, Inc., Optimal+, Rudolph, Siemens AG (through its acquisition of Mentor Graphics, which previously acquired Galaxy Semiconductor Solutions), and Trancom Technology, Inc. and, (iii) inline inspection, metrology and electrical test equipment providers, such as Applied Materials, Inc., Hermes Microvision, Inc., and Keysight Technologies, Inc. Further, ARM Ltd. and Synopsys provide standard cells in the physical IP space and Tela Innovations, Inc. provides software for standard cell synthesis, each of which could compete with our Template™ technology solution. Further, we may compete with the products or offerings of the same or additional companies if we expand our offerings, or they expand their offerings, through acquisition or development. In addition, Synopsys now appears to offer directly competing DFM solutions, while other EDA suppliers provide alternative DFM solutions that may compete for the same budgetary funds. 
 
        We believe that our solutions compare favorably with respect to competition because we have demonstrated results and reputation, strong core technology, ability to create innovative technology, and ability to implement solutions for new technology and product generations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 417 employees worldwide, including 265 on client service teams, 91 in research and development, 26 in sales and marketing, and 35 in general and administrative functions. Of these employees, 186 are located in the United States and Canada, 190 in Asia, and 41 in Europe. 
 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Our employees in France and Italy are subject to collective bargaining agreements in those countries. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. Competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in our industry. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management, marketing and technical employees.
