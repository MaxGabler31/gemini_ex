Overview 
 ChemoCentryx is a biopharmaceutical company developing new medications targeted at inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Each of our drug candidates is designed to selectively block a specific chemoattractant receptor, leaving the rest of the immune system intact. Our drug candidates are small molecules, which are orally administered, and, if approved, could address unmet medical needs, including improved efficacy, and offer significant quality of life benefits, since patients swallow a capsule or pill instead of having to visit a clinic for an infusion or undergo an injection. 
 In 2016, we executed on our strategy to form an alliance with a partner that could provide upfront fees and milestone payments to support the clinical development of our two leading drug candidates, avacopan and CCX140, to registration and pay us royalties upon sales in international markets, while we develop our own commercial infrastructure to sell directly in the United States. 
 To help communicate the breadth of our drug discovery platform, we have segmented our pipeline into early stage and late stage drug candidates. 
 Late Stage Drug Candidates 
 We have chosen to focus initially on orphan indications, where drug candidates tend to enjoy a faster path to market and better reimbursement. Our leading drug candidates address areas of clear unmet need, where the current standard of care, or SOC, is insufficient to halt progression of the disease and/or where todays treatment options come with serious side effects, such as those which accompany the prolonged use of steroids: 
Avacopan (CCX168)  Inhibition of Complement-Mediated Pathways in Orphan Diseases 
 Avacopan (formerly CCX168) is an orally-administered complement inhibitor targeting the C5a receptor, or C5aR, and is being developed for orphan diseases, including (i) anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic auto-antibody associated vasculitis, or AAV, a devastating autoimmune disease that damages blood vessels and can lead to kidney failure, pulmonary failure and damage to other tissues; (ii) complement 3 glomerulopathy, or C3G, a debilitating disease that can lead to kidney failure; and (iii) moderate and severe hidradenitis suppurativa, or HS, a chronic, inflammatory, debilitating skin disease characterized by recurrent, painful, nodules and abscesses, ultimately leading to the formation of draining fistulas (also known as sinus tracts) as well as scarring. 
 Avacopan has been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of AAV and C3G and by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for the treatment of C3G and microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, both forms of AAV. Additionally, avacopan has been granted PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, designation from the EMA, to expedite its clinical development, and to potentially accelerate its marketing authorization. 
 Following completion of two Phase II clinical trials in patients with AAV, in which avacopan was well-tolerated and provided effective steroid-free control of the disease, we launched the Phase III ADVOCATE trial in December 2016. The FDA and the EMA concurred with the design of the study. ADVOCATE is a randomized, double-blind two-arm study which enrolled over 300 patients at over 200 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Patient enrollment of the Phase III ADVOCATE trial was completed in July 2018 and we expect to report topline data from this trial in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, we launched a registration-supporting clinical trial to study avacopan for the treatment of patients with C3G for which we aim to complete enrollment in 2019 and initiated a large placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical trial, the AURORA trial, for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe HS in the fourth quarter of 2018.

  CCX140  Chronic and Orphan Kidney Diseases 
 CCX140, an orally-administered inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2, has been in development for diabetic nephropathy, or DN, a form of chronic kidney disease, or CKD, and is now being developed for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, a rare renal disease characterized by progressive proteinuria, excess protein in the urine, and impaired renal function. CCX140 has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of FSGS. 
 A global Phase II clinical trial of CCX140 in patients with DN met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that CCX140 given orally once-daily added to a SOC renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in proteinuria, beyond that achieved with SOC alone, with the most pronounced effect shown in the patients with highest levels of proteinuria. Based on the safety and efficacy data related to reduction in proteinuria observed in the Phase II trial in DN, we launched two Phase IIb clinical trials, the LUMINA trials, of CCX140 for the treatment of primary FSGS, with and without nephrotic syndrome, for which there are currently no FDA-approved treatments. 
 Kidney Health Alliance with Vifor 
 In May 2016, we announced a partnership, which we refer to as the Avacopan Agreement, with Vifor (International) Ltd., and/or its affiliates, or collectively, Vifor, a European-based world leader specializing in kidney disease. While under this agreement we retained all rights to the United States and China, we granted Vifor exclusive commercialization rights to avacopan in Europe and certain other international markets. In December 2016, we entered into an additional agreement with Vifor, which we refer to as the CCX140 Agreement, relating to CCX140, our other late stage drug candidate. Under the CCX140 Agreement, we again retained all rights to the United States and China and we granted Vifor exclusive worldwide commercialization rights outside of the United States and China. In February 2017, we announced a further agreement with Vifor that harmonized the geographic commercialization rights underlying the agreements for both drug candidates, which we refer to as the Avacopan Amendment. In June 2018, we entered into additional agreements with Vifor to further expand Vifors exclusive commercialization rights to include China under the Avacopan Agreement, or the Avacopan Letter Agreement, and the CCX140 Agreement, or the CCX140 Letter Agreement. 
 We have secured $215 million in upfront cash and milestone payments pursuant to our agreements with Vifor and are eligible for additional substantial milestone payments. Through our alliance, we maintain the commercialization rights to avacopan and CCX140 in the United States, and also retain control of the clinical development programs for orphan renal disease. Vifor gained the exclusive commercialization rights for all other international markets, and is obligated to pay us tiered royalties, with rates ranging from ten to the mid-twenties, on potential net sales. 
 At a future time defined in the CCX140 Agreement, Vifor has an option to solely develop and commercialize CCX140 in more prevalent forms of CKD. Should Vifor later exercise the CKD option, we would receive co-promotion rights for CKD in the United States, and we estimate that the clinical development and registration process for CKD would end at approximately the same time as Orphan Drug exclusivity. 
 In October 2018, Vifor acquired 7,343,492 shares of our common stock from Glaxo Group Limited, bringing their aggregate holdings of our common stock to 10,676,825 as of December 31, 2018. 
 Early Stage Drug Candidates 
 While we have focused initially on orphan indications, our target-specific and selective approach designed to stop the spread of inflammatory disease-inducing cells shows promise in other disease areas. Over time we plan to bring forward drug candidates to treat a range of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, as well as cancer, where our drug candidate CCX872 has shown promise in a Phase Ib trial for advanced pancreatic cancer. We expect that our ability to do so will grow as we increase our scale and to the extent that we start to earn revenues and royalties from the commercialization of our late stage kidney disease franchise.

  Our Drug Candidate Pipeline 
 Broad Pipeline from Novel Discovery Platform 
 




Late Stage Drug Candidates 
 Avacopan (CCX168)  Inhibition of Complement-Mediated Pathways in Orphan Diseases 
 In our complement inhibition orphan disease program, our lead drug candidate is avacopan. 
 Avacopan is a small molecule that selectively blocks the chemoattractant receptor known as C5aR, and is being developed for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Avacopan inhibits the activity of complement C5a, a component of the complement system and the natural ligand for C5aR. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to regulate aspects of host defense against bacteria and viruses, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. The complement system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not attack the bodys healthy cells. In certain autoimmune diseases (including those in which we are engaged in clinical trials), components of the complement system have become dysregulated. 
 The FDA has granted avacopan orphan-drug designation for AAV and C3G. The European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation for avacopan for the treatment of two forms of AAV: microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegeners granulomatosis), as well as for C3G. 
 In April 2016, we announced the award of an FDA Orphan Products Development grant of $500,000 to support the clinical development of avacopan for the treatment of patients with AAV in the United States. 
 Avacopan is in Phase III development for the treatment of patients with AAV in a pivotal trial called ADVOCATE. In May 2016, pursuant to the Avacopan Agreement, Vifor licensed the rights to commercialize avacopan for orphan renal diseases in Europe, certain other markets outside the United States and most of Asia. In February 2017, we entered into the Avacopan Amendment to expand the Vifor territories to include all markets outside the United States and China. In June 2018, we entered into the Avacopan Letter Agreement with Vifor to further expand Vifors exclusive commercialization rights under the Avacopan Agreement to include China. We retain all rights to commercialize avacopan in the United States and also retain control of the clinical development programs for orphan renal disease. Additionally, we launched a potentially registration-supporting clinical trial to study avacopan for the treatment of patients with C3G for which we aim to complete enrollment in 2019 and initiated a large placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical trial, the AURORA trial, for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe HS in the fourth quarter of 2018. All of these activities are designed to potentially support registration of avacopan in these indications.

  AAV and C3G are orphan autoimmune diseases that are characterized by inflammation that often affects the kidneys, among other major organs. HS is a chronic, inflammatory, debilitating skin disease characterized by recurrent, painful, nodules and abscesses, ultimately leading to the formation of draining fistulas (also known as sinus tracts) as well as scarring. 
 ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (AAV) 
 AAV is an orphan, severe, and often fatal autoimmune disease that is characterized by elevated levels of autoantibodies called anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies and by inflammation that can affect many different organ systems, and commonly involves the kidneys. AAV affects approximately 40,000 people in the United States, with approximately 4,000 new cases each year; similarly, AAV affects approximately 50,000 people in Europe, with approximately 5,000 new cases each year. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 AAV is currently treated with courses of immuno-suppressants (cyclophosphamide, or CYC, or rituximab, or RTX) combined with high-dose glucocorticoids (a type of steroid) administration. Complete remission is achieved in only 60-80% of patients and relapse is common. Following initial treatment, up to 30% of patients relapse within six to 18 months, and approximately 50% of all patients relapse within three to five years. 
 The current SOC for AAV is associated with significant safety risks. First year mortality is approximately 11% to 18%. The single greatest cause of premature mortality is not disease related adverse events, but rather infection and other side effects that are thought largely to be a consequence of steroid administration. The multiple adverse effects of courses of steroid treatment (both initial courses and those that are repeated as a consequence of relapse) are major causes of both short-term and long-term morbidity, damage and death. Such therapy-related adverse events contribute significantly to patient care costs, as well as to the diminution of quality of life for patients. 
 Role of C5a and C5aR in AAV 
 Complement C5a, acting through its receptor C5aR, sometimes called C5aR1 or CD88, is thought to play a pro-inflammatory role in AAV. Autoantibodies against neutrophil enzymes lead to the priming and activation of neutrophils and activation of the complement cascade. Activation of the complement cascade leads to production of C5a, one of the most potent pro-inflammatory mediators of the complement system. C5a, through binding to its receptor C5aR, induces expression of adhesion molecules and chemotactic migration of neutrophils and other white blood cells. These accumulating adhering neutrophils initiate an inflammatory cascade in the small blood vessels by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemoattractants that lead to necrotizing vasculitis. 
 Importantly, there are two distinct receptors for C5a: the pro-inflammatory C5a receptor known as C5aR, the target of avacopan, and the anti-inflammatory C5a-like receptor, or C5L2, which plays an important role in homeostasis. Accordingly, precisely inhibiting C5a at the level of the C5aR receptor is thought to block the pro-inflammatory effects of C5a, while leaving the protective effects of C5L2 functional. Avacopan does not bind into C5L2, thereby not interfering with the protective effects of C5L2. 
 Avacopan  A Novel C5a Receptor Inhibitor 
 Avacopan is a potent and highly specific inhibitor of C5aR, is orally bioavailable and has demonstrated an excellent preclinical safety profile, consistent with its intended chronic use in patients. Avacopan does not affect formation of the C5b-9 terminal complement complex (or MAC), unlike the anti-C5-antibody, eculizumab (Soliris®). Therefore, avacopan is believed not to increase the susceptibility to infections for which MAC is important in host defense, such as Neisseria meningitidis.

  The efficacy of avacopan was demonstrated in a mouse model of the renal manifestations of AAV, which closely mimics many of the histological features of the human disease. In these studies, oral doses of avacopan completely blocked the glomerulonephritis induced by intravenous injection of anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies (one of the anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies that are implicated in AAV in humans). Levels of avacopan in the blood of these mice were comparable to levels in the blood of AAV patients who participated in our Phase II CLEAR and CLASSIC clinical trials with avacopan. 
 Clinical Development in AAV 
 Avacopan Phase I Clinical Trials 
 We have completed six Phase I clinical trials with avacopan in a total of 166 healthy subjects and 24 subjects with hepatic impairment. These studies evaluated the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic, or PK, and pharmacodynamic, or PD, profiles of avacopan, given orally at doses ranging from a single dose of 1 mg up to 100 mg given twice-daily for five days. Avacopan was well-tolerated and appeared to be safe in these studies. No serious adverse events or dropouts due to adverse events were observed in these studies. The most commonly reported adverse events in subjects receiving avacopan in these studies were headache, diarrhea, dizziness, sore throat, upper respiratory tract infections and decrease in white blood cells. These adverse events typically were mild and dosing was not stopped as a result. 
Avacopan Phase II Clinical Trials 
 We have completed and reported positive clinical data from two Phase II clinical trials, known as the CLEAR and CLASSIC trials, with avacopan in patients with AAV.
 CLEAR was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 67 patients with AAV in Europe. The aim of this trial was to provide effective therapy for AAV with an inhibitor of the C5a receptor while reducing toxicity associated with SOC therapy by eliminating or reducing exposure to high-dose systemic steroid use. The primary safety objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of avacopan in patients with AAV on background CYC or RTX treatment. The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the effect of avacopan based on the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, or BVAS. BVAS measures AAV disease activity across all organ systems and is the most widely used and clinically validated outcome measure in AAV clinical trials. The higher the BVAS score, the higher the level of disease activity. The greater the reduction in BVAS score with treatment, the greater the disease improvement. The secondary objectives of this clinical trial included assessment of the feasibility of reducing or eliminating the use of steroids in the treatment of patients with AAV without the need for rescue steroid measures, assessment of changes in renal function based on estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, hematuria, and proteinuria with avacopan compared to SOC treatment, assessment of the effect of avacopan on health-related quality of life measurements, and evaluation of the PK and PD profiles of avacopan in patients with AAV. 
 The CLEAR trial met its primary endpoint based on the BVAS response at week 12 in patients receiving avacopan, compared to those patients receiving the high-dose steroid-containing SOC. Specifically, all treatment groups receiving avacopan demonstrated a statistically significant (P=0.002) non-inferior clinical efficacy outcome when compared to SOC. The study contained two avacopan-treated groups. One group received avacopan with a low dose of steroids (one third the steroid in the SOC group), in which the BVAS response was 86% at week 12 versus 70% for SOC (P=0.002 for non-inferiority). A separate group received avacopan without steroids; in this group the BVAS response was 81% (P=0.01 for non-inferiority). SOC treatment included a standard background immunosuppressant (CYC or RTX) given to all patients. The primary endpoint of BVAS response was prospectively defined as the proportion of patients with a decrease from baseline of at least 50% in BVAS plus no worsening in any body system. 
 Other beneficial changes were noted, including in pre-specified secondary endpoints: 
 

(i) | Avacopan exhibited a more rapid onset of improvement than SOC treatment, as evidenced by beneficial changes in proteinuria (measured as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, or UACR); also

 CLASSIC was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial in patients in the United States and Canada with either newly diagnosed or relapsing AAV who required either CYC or RTX treatment. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either placebo plus CYC or RTX plus full dose starting steroids; 10mg avacopan twice-daily plus CYC or RTX plus full dose starting steroids; or 30mg avacopan twice-daily plus CYC or RTX plus full dose starting steroids. The treatment period was 12 weeks, with a 12-week follow-up period. The aim of the CLASSIC trial was different from the CLEAR trial. The CLASSIC trial was mainly a regulatory and safety trial. As such, the main goal of CLASSIC was to evaluate the safety of avacopan when given with high-dose steroid-containing SOC treatment, which also includes CYC or RTX. Therefore, the primary safety objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of avacopan in patients with AAV on background CYC or RTX treatment. The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the efficacy of avacopan based on BVAS. The study was not sized to formally evaluate efficacy. A total of 42 patients were enrolled in this trial. 
 The CLASSIC safety study met its objectives. Avacopan was shown to be well-tolerated in patients with AAV when added to the current SOC regimen. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar across treatment groups in the study. While the CLASSIC safety study was not designed or powered for inferential statistical analyses on efficacy, treatment response for each cohort was assessed at week 12 using the BVAS. Results showed that the BVAS response was numerically higher in patients receiving avacopan compared to control. The 30mg avacopan dose appeared to be most effective, based on a higher number of patients achieving early remission (based on BVAS of 0) at week four. The renal function, measured by eGFR appeared to improve most in the 30mg avacopan group, and renal response (based on improvement in hematuria, albuminuria, and eGFR) appeared to be highest in the 30mg avacopan group. 
 Taken together, these results suggest that avacopan, a target-specific C5aR inhibitor, may provide effective control of the disease while eliminating chronic steroids in the treatment of AAV. Avacopan also appeared safe and well-tolerated in the trials. There were no observations that would prevent further clinical development of avacopan. We also completed the long-term toxicology program with avacopan. The results provide support for chronic dosing of avacopan in future clinical trials. 
 We held End-of-Phase II meetings with the FDA and Protocol Assistance/Scientific Advice meetings with the EMA in 2016. Both the FDA and the EMA concurred with the design and scope of the Phase III registration clinical trial in AAV. 
 Avacopan Phase III Clinical Trial 
 In December 2016, we initiated the ADVOCATE, or Avacopan Development in Vasculitis to Obtain Corticosteroid elimination and Therapeutic Efficacy, Phase III clinical trial. ADVOCATE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled worldwide clinical trial which enrolled over 300 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing AAV at over 200 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. The aim of the trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of avacopan in inducing and sustaining remission in patients with AAV. The study includes two treatment arms: the test arm contains 30mg twice-daily oral doses of avacopan and eliminates corticosteroids, and the control arm contains an avacopan-matching placebo and

   maintains a standard regimen of high-dose chronic steroids. All patients also receive a standard background immunosuppressant, either CYC followed by azathioprine or RTX. Primary endpoints will be measured by BVAS, assessing disease remission at weeks 26 and 52. Other key endpoints include early remission (BVAS of 0 at week 4), quality of life, and corticosteroid-related toxicities. Patient enrollment of the Phase III ADVOCATE trial was completed in July 2018 and we expect to report topline data from this trial in the fourth quarter of 2019 and believe, if successful, these data could form the basis of avacopans registration for the treatment of AAV in the United States and Europe. 
Avacopan Regulatory Matters 
 In addition to the earlier referenced orphan drug designations granted to avacopan by the FDA and the EMA, avacopan was also granted access to the EMAs PRIME initiative, which supports accelerated assessment of investigational therapies addressing unmet medical need. This was based on the assessment by the EMA that (i) AAV is a highly severe disease with high mortality; (ii) current standard therapies (including steroids) have partial efficacy and severe toxicity, indicating a high unmet medical need in AAV; and (iii) avacopan provides a new mechanism of action for the potential treatment of AAV and has the potential to significantly address the unmet medical need based on nonclinical and clinical data. 
 We filed a CMA application for avacopan in the treatment of patients with AAV with the EMA which was validated by the EMA in December 2017. In light of the upcoming availability of data from the pivotal Phase III ADVOCATE trial, we decided to withdraw the CMA application based on Phase II data. We intend to file integrated regulatory submissions in 2020 with the EMA and FDA for full (unconditional) marketing approval after the planned release of topline data from the Phase III ADVOCATE trial anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
 Complement 3 Glomerulopathy (C3G) 
 C3G disease is an ultra-rare disease of the kidney that is characterized by deposition of the complement fragment known as C3 in the glomeruli, or filtration units of the kidney, leading to inflammatory cell accumulation, profound kidney damage and eventual renal failure. The prevalence of C3G is estimated at two to three per million people or approximately 800 patients in the United States and approximately 2,000 in Europe. 
 Role of C5a and C5aR in C3G 
 While the disease name refers to complement 3, it is well known that the C5a receptor pathway, which is further downstream of C3 in the complement cascade and the target of avacopan, is an essential part of the disease causing pathology. Hence, C3 is a marker of more general complement activation. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 There is currently no approved effective standard therapy for C3G. Typically, patients receive one or more non-specific immunosuppressants. Without treatment, C3G leads to kidney failure, and the current array of unapproved therapies at best only delays end stage renal disease, or ESRD. Kidney transplant is frequently the only option, and even after transplantation, the disease invariably returns. 
Clinical Development in C3G 
 Avacopan Phase II Clinical Trial in C3G 
 We launched a registration-supporting clinical trial to study avacopan for the treatment of patients with C3G. The clinical trial is expected to enroll approximately 88 patients with C3G, including both C3 Glomerulonephritis and Dense Deposit Disease. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of avacopan

   compared to placebo based on histologic changes in kidney biopsies taken at baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint will be based on the percent change from baseline in the C3G Histologic Index for disease activity. 
 The secondary objectives of this trial include evaluation of: (i) the safety of avacopan compared to placebo based on the incidence of adverse events, changes in clinical laboratory measurements, and vital signs; (ii) changes in laboratory parameters of renal disease including eGFR, proteinuria, and urinary excretion of MCP-1 with avacopan compared to placebo; (iii) health-related quality-of-life changes based on Short Form-36 version 2, or SF-36 v2, and EuroQOL-5D-5L, or EQ-5D-5L, with avacopan compared to placebo; and (iv) the PK profile of avacopan in patients with C3G. 
 Patients meeting inclusion criteria start study drug treatment on Day 1. Patients receive avacopan 30mg or matching placebo orally twice-daily. The placebo-controlled treatment period is 26 weeks (182 days). This will be followed by 26 weeks during which time all patients will receive avacopan. Thereafter, all patients will be followed for eight weeks (56 days) without study drug treatment. 
 Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) 
 HS is a chronic, inflammatory, debilitating skin disease characterized by recurrent, painful, nodules and abscesses, ultimately leading to the formation of draining fistulas (also known as sinus tracts) as well as scarring. The diseases originates from inflammation and occlusion of the hair follicle. Apart from pain, the nodules may rupture, and often extrude a purulent, foul-smelling discharge leading to substantial social embarrassment for these patients. Due to its chronic nature and frequently occurring relapses of the skin lesions, HS has a great impact on the patients quality of life, deeply affecting social, working, and psychological aspects. 
 In the United States, moderate to severe HS has orphan designation with an estimated prevalence of up to 200,000 patients. In Europe, the number of affected patients is believed to be greater, with higher prevalence. 
 Role of C5a and C5aR in HS 
 Neutrophils are believed to play an important disease-promoting role, as well as certain cytokines and mediators commonly found in autoimmune diseases, such as TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-1 and others such as C5a. C5a promotes inflammatory mediators and is a strong activator of neutrophils. HS is a neutrophil-driven skin disease and C5a has been found activated and significantly elevated in plasma of HS patients, as compared to healthy controls. In an open label Phase IIa study in 12 patients with moderate and severe HS, a specific intravenous anti-C5a antibody was shown to improve skin lesion in patients with moderate to severe HS. 
 With the role of C5a in HS, our C5aR antagonist avacopan could be effective in mediating the disease course of HS. Avacopan is a small molecule that is conveniently administered as an oral medication and could present itself as advantageous over intravenous or subcutaneous injections treatments for this condition. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Depending on the severity of disease, the current standard of care for HS patients includes topical, oral or intravenous antibiotic treatment, as well as surgery. 
 Adalimumab, an anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody, is the only drug indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe HS. Two pivotal adalimumab trials showed that approximately 50% of the patients who were treated with adalimumab achieved an improvement in their skin lesion, as measured by the widely accepted HiSCR (Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response) assessment instrument. There remains a high unmet medical need, however, as a very large proportion of the patients with moderate to severe HS do not adequately respond to adalimumab or other therapies used in the standard of care.

  Avacopan Clinical Development in HS 
 Based on the role of C5a in the pathogenesis of HS, we believe that there is significant interest in the medical-scientific community to develop avacopan for the treatment of patients in HS. We initiated a clinical trial, the AURORA trial, of avacopan in patients with moderate to severe HS in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 The AURORA trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three arm Phase IIb trial in approximately 390 subjects with moderate to severe HS (Hurley stage II or III). Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to a treatment of 10 mg avacopan twice-daily, 30 mg avacopan twice-daily or placebo for 12 weeks. Subjects treated with 10 mg or 30 mg twice-daily during the blinded, placebo-controlled 12-week treatment period will be followed by an additional 24-week, active treatment period during which they will continue to receive the same dose regimen, either 10 mg or 30 mg avacopan twice-daily. Subjects on placebo who complete the blinded, placebo-controlled 12-week period will be re-randomized 1:1 to receive 10 mg or 30 mg avacopan twice-daily during the 24-week active treatment period. Thereafter, all subjects will be followed without study drug for eight weeks before they exit the study. 
 The primary efficacy objective is based on subjects achieving a HiSCR after 12 weeks of treatment. HiSCR is defined as at least a 50% reduction in abscess and inflammatory nodule count and no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count at Week 12 relative to baseline. The primary safety objective is to evaluate the safety of avacopan compared to placebo based on the adverse event incidence, changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, and vital signs. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of the subjects global assessment of skin pain numeric rating scale, the Sartorius score, International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score, Hidradenitis Suppurativa-Physicians Global Assessment, and the proportion of subjects who experienced flare or who received rescue therapy, and the duration of flare. Other secondary objectives include the assessment of subject reported outcomes including health-related quality-of-life changes based on the SF-36 v2, the EQ-5D-5L, and the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Quality of Life Index as well as the evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of avacopan in subjects with HS. 
 Avacopan Commercialization Strategy 
 We plan on building a sales infrastructure in the United States to commercialize our orphan disease drug candidates, including avacopan. Given that two of the target indications for which avacopan is being developed may have significant renal involvement, we expect that our future sales force will focus primarily on nephrologists. Other physician specialists such as rheumatologists, involved in the diagnosis and treatment of those diseases would also be targeted by our sales forces. In territories outside of the United States, our partner Vifor would be responsible for the commercialization of avacopan. 
 In May 2016, we entered into the Avacopan Agreement with Vifor to commercialize avacopan for orphan renal diseases in Europe and certain other markets. In connection with the Avacopan Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront payment of $85.0 million, comprising $60.0 million in cash and $25.0 million in the form of an equity investment to purchase 3,333,333 shares of our common stock at a price of $7.50 per share. In February 2017, we and Vifor entered into the Avacopan Amendment to expand the licensed territory to include all markets outside the United States and China and we received an additional $20.0 million upfront cash commitment. Upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales based milestones with avacopan, we will receive additional payments under this agreement. In addition, we will receive royalties, with rates ranging from the teens to mid-twenties, on future potential net sales of avacopan by Vifor in the licensed territories. In December 2017, we achieved the first regulatory milestone under the Avacopan Agreement in the amount of $50.0 million, following the EMAs validation of the CMA application for avacopan for the treatment of patients with AAV. In June 2018, we and Vifor entered into the Avacopan Letter Agreement to further expand the Vifor territories under the Avacopan Agreement to provide Vifor with exclusive commercialization rights in China and we received a $5.0 million payment for the expanded rights. We retain control of ongoing and future development of avacopan (other than country-specific development in the licensed territories) and all commercialization rights to avacopan in the United States.

  Under a prior development and commercialization agreement with Glaxo Group Limited, or GSK, an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline, which ended in 2013, we are subject to reverse royalties to GSK of 3% on annual worldwide net sales of avacopan, not to exceed $50.0 million in total royalties. 
CCX140  Chronic and Orphan Kidney Diseases 
 Our second drug candidate in the orphan disease space is CCX140, an inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2. CCX140 is an orally-administered small molecule that is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2. CCX140 has an excellent preclinical and clinical profile, including good safety and tolerability demonstrated in hundreds of healthy volunteers or patients with diabetes or diabetic nephropathy across seven clinical trials. These clinical trials include a successfully completed one-year dosing of CCX140 in a Phase II trial in CKD associated with diabetes. Preclinical data to date suggests CCR2 inhibition involves a unique mechanism of action in the kidney including a novel element of renal cellular protection at the level of the podocyte leading to rapid improvement in proteinuria. CCX140 has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of FSGS. 
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) 
 FSGS is a histologic lesion that is associated with the clinical presentation, in children or adults, of proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal insufficiency. Nephrotic syndrome is the combination of nephrotic-range proteinuria (loss of more than three grams of protein per day into the urine) with a low serum albumin level and edema. Each kidney is made up of approximately one million tiny filters called glomeruli. Glomeruli filter blood, taking out the water-like part that becomes urine and leaving protein in the blood. When glomeruli or sections of the glomeruli become damaged or scarred (sclerosis), proteins leak into the urine (proteinuria). FSGS is understood to start with damage to podocytes, cells that wrap around capillaries of the glomerulus. Podocytes form part of the barrier that enable the glomerulus to filter the blood in a manner that retains large molecules such as proteins, while smaller molecules such as water, salts, and sugars are filtered as the first step in the formation of urine. 
 FSGS is classified as primary or idiopathic when the cause is not known, and secondary when it occurs in the setting of recognized genetic mutations or associated disease. The distinction between primary and secondary FSGS can be difficult, but it has been estimated that in 80% of the cases the etiology is unknown. Primary or idiopathic FSGS often presents with the nephrotic syndrome. Secondary FSGS, which most often presents with non-nephrotic proteinuria and some degree of renal insufficiency, can occur in the setting of genetic vulnerability, podocyte injury due to toxins or infections, or as an adaptive response to glomerular hypertrophy or hyper-filtration. 
 Symptoms or signs of FSGS may not be noticeable early in the course of disease, presenting only when sufficiently advanced to cause edema, or when physical examination and laboratory assessment reveal proteinuria, low blood albumin levels, high cholesterol and/or high blood pressure. FSGS is a disease characterized by progressive glomerular scarring and is life-threatening. In 20% of children and in 40% of adults, it is the underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome. When accompanied by high levels of proteinuria at the time of presentation, 50% of patients with FSGS will progress to ESRD within three to eight years. FSGS is causal for 4% of all ESRD cases. Furthermore, after kidney transplantation for primary FSGS, the recurrence rate is 40%. 
 FSGS is a rare form of CKD that affects approximately 80,000 patients in the United States, with 5,500 to 9,500 new cases each year. FSGS attacks the glomeruli causing scarring which leads to permanent kidney damage. Progressive FSGS can lead to ESRD, ultimately requiring kidney transplant or renal dialysis and total health expenditures of hundreds of thousands of dollars each year per patient. 
 Current Treatment Approaches 
 There are no approved drugs for the treatment of FSGS. Moreover, current treatment approaches are not very effective in halting the disease. Usually, treatments for FSGS include renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, or 
 
12 


Index to Financial Statements
   RAAS, system blockers, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, diuretics and diet change (reducing sodium and protein intake). 
 RAAS blockade reduces proteinuria and slows progression in proteinuric kidney diseases, and is commonly used for treatment of secondary FSGS. Whether or not this is effective in primary FSGS is unknown. Patients with histologic evidence of primary FSGS who have nephrotic syndrome are usually offered disease-modifying therapy with glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive drugs. However, in the absence of nephrotic range proteinuria (>3.5 g/day), administration of steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs is generally not recommended. In many cases, an overall course of treatment of at least six months is required and complete remission may not be attained for 12 months or longer. Shorter courses (two months or less) result in much lower remission rates (20% to 30%). 
 Patients with little or no reduction in protein excretion at 12 to 16 weeks are considered steroid resistant. Initial therapy of steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant FSGS consists of a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) with or without low-dose prednisone. Among those unresponsive to this combination, or among those with substantially reduced eGFR (<40 mL/min per 1.73 m2), mycophenolate mofetil in combination with glucocorticoids is recommended. In addition, in patients at increased risk for glucocorticoid-associated toxicity (e.g., obese patients, diabetic patients, patients with severe osteoporosis, patients >70 years of age), cyclosporine or tacrolimus with or without low-dose prednisone has been recommended, although data evaluating this strategy are limited. Calcineurin inhibitors must be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because of the nephrotoxicity of these drugs, and some authors recommend avoiding these in subjects whose kidney function approaches renal failure, i.e., subjects with an eGFR of <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 As described above, there are no effective therapies available for FSGS. Control of hypertension, particularly with angiotensin inhibitors, is supportive but does not address the underlying pathology. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants are also used, but the results have been inconsistent. The increased risk of infection associated with these agents is a significant concern. Histologic recurrence in renal transplants is high, with high levels of proteinuria portending a poor renal prognosis. 
 Role of CCR2 inhibition in FSGS 
 There is evidence that the chemokine receptor known as CCR2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of FSGS. CCR2 is a major driver of monocyte migration and activation, and has been shown to mediate renal interstitial inflammation and tubular atrophy in a number of chronic renal diseases by recruiting monocytes to the renal interstitium. Further, studies have shown that the degree of protein excretion correlates with urine MCP-1 levels, one of the signature ligands of CCR2 and a biomarker of inflammation, and the infiltration of immune cells called macrophages into the kidney in patients with CKD. Experiments performed in vitro have added to the mechanistic rationale for the notion that CCR2 is an important driver of FSGS. Proteinuria is the hallmark characteristic of FSGS, and in vitro experiments have found that tubular epithelial cells release MCP-1 when exposed to serum proteins on the inside of the tubules. Clinically, in children with FSGS, urinary MCP-1 levels correlate with the degree of proteinuria. 
 Blocking CCR2 provided significant and rapid renal protection in two distinct models of FSGS, as measured both by reduction in proteinuria and improvement in multiple histological parameters, and it thus represents a novel and mechanistically-distinct approach for the treatment of FSGS. 
 In the 5/6 remnant kidney model, mice had a rapid reduction in protein excretion when treated with a CCR2 inhibitor and a RAAS inhibitor. Combining a CCR2 inhibitor with a RAAS inhibitor reduced the protein excretion by 91%. The protective effects were evident within one week of treatment and were maintained for the duration of the study (six weeks). The same renal protective effects of CCR2 blockade were seen in the

   adriamycin nephropathy model. Administration of adriamycin caused significant proteinuria, which was significantly reduced by the combination of a CCR2 inhibitor and a RAAS inhibitor after two weeks of treatment. Histological parameters also improved with the combination of the CCR2 inhibitor and a RAAS inhibitor; these included reduced glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular sclerosis, kidney fibrosis, and mesangial expansion and increased podocyte density. Further, we demonstrated marked histological improvements in an FSGS animal model through inhibition of CCR2, including increased density of podocytes. The data suggest CCR2 inhibition involves a unique mechanism of action in the kidney including a novel element of renal cellular protection at the level of the podocyte. 
Clinical Development 
 Our clinical development strategy was to first assess the safety and tolerability of CCX140 in healthy subjects, then in patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function, and finally to evaluate the drug in patients with DN. As a precursor to our clinical trials in patients with DN, we completed a 159-patient randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of CCX140 in patients with type 2 diabetes, one of the most common causes of nephropathy. We also subsequently completed a 332-patient randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CCX140 in patients with DN. 
 Based on safety and encouraging efficacy signals related to reduction in proteinuria and stabilization/improvement of renal function observed in the Phase II study in patients with DN, we launched our clinical-development program of CCX140 for the treatment of patients with FSGS. 
 CCX140 Phase I Clinical Trials 
 We completed four Phase I clinical trials in 118 healthy volunteers. A CCX140 dose range of 0.05 to 15mg was studied. CCX140 was generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events observed in these Phase I clinical trials. The PK profile was supportive of once-daily oral dosing of CCX140 in the Phase II clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes and in patients with DN. 
CCX140 Phase II Clinical Trial in Type 2 Diabetes 
 Our Phase II clinical trial was designed to demonstrate safety of CCX140 in patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function, and to examine the effect of CCX140 on glycemic indices. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled clinical trial in 159 patients with type 2 diabetes on a stable dose of metformin for at least eight weeks, with 32 patients receiving placebo, 32 receiving pioglitazone hydrochloride (an approved therapeutic for type 2 diabetes serving as the active control), 63 receiving 5mg of CCX140 and 32 receiving 10mg of CCX140 orally once-daily for 28 days. 
 The clinical trial met its primary objective by demonstrating the safety and tolerability of CCX140 in these patients. In addition, CCX140 showed encouraging signs of biological activity based on a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c, a marker of glycemic control, for the 10mg dose group. 
 CCX140 Phase II Clinical Trial in Diabetic Nephropathy 
 We completed a Phase II clinical trial in patients with DN. A total of 332 patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The goals of this clinical trial were to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CCX140 in patients with DN. The primary efficacy objective was evaluation of the effect of CCX140 on albuminuria. Secondary efficacy objectives were evaluation of the effect of CCX140 on HbA1c and eGFR. The three treatment groups consisted of (i) SOC, (ii) a RAAS inhibitor, plus placebo (control group), and (iii) 5mg and 10mg of CCX140 once-daily plus SOC. The treatment duration was up to 52 weeks, with a four-week follow-up period. Patients with residual albuminuria, despite being on a stable therapeutic dose of a RAAS inhibitor, were included in this clinical trial. The key efficacy endpoint was a change from baseline in first morning UACR, a major indicator of renal health.

  The Phase II trial met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that treatment with 5mg of CCX140 given orally once-daily added to a SOC regimen of RAAS inhibitor treatment resulted in a statistically significant (p=0.01) improvement in UACR, beyond that achieved with SOC alone. The maximum treatment effect (24% reduction) was reached at 12 weeks, and sustained reduction in albuminuria induced by CCX140 relative to SOC alone was observed over the full year (UACR at each one of the ten time points over the 52-week treatment period in the patients who received 5mg CCX140 continuously for 52 weeks, were below those of the SOC alone group). A dose of 10mg CCX140 per day did not provide more improvement in albuminuria as compared to the 5mg dose. CCX140 did not affect systematic blood pressure, suggesting that the beneficial effect of CCX140 is mediated locally in the kidney micro-environment, possibly through a beneficial reduction in renal inflammation. CCX140 was well-tolerated with a low overall dropout rate over the 52-week treatment period (10%). No safety issues were observed that would prevent further clinical development of CCX140 in DN. 
 CCX140 Phase II Clinical Trials in Primary Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis 
 The successfully completed CCX140 Phase II clinical trial in DN, which demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in proteinuria compared to SOC, showed the most pronounced effect in the highest proteinuric patients. In addition, preclinical data to date suggest CCR2 inhibition involves a unique mechanism of action in the kidney including a novel element of renal cellular protection at the level of the podocyte, leading to rapid improvement in proteinuria. Building upon our orphan kidney disease franchise, we launched our clinical development program of CCX140 in patients with primary FSGS. Our clinical development program will comprise two populations of patients: 

(i) | Primary FSGS patients with sub-nephrotic (moderate) proteinuria (>1 g/g)  LUMINA 1 trial; and
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Primary FSGS patients with nephrotic syndrome (heavy proteinuria>3.5 g/g)  LUMINA 2 trial.
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The first trial is a randomized controlled, dose ranging study with the aim to evaluate the effect of treatment with CCX140 in subjects with sub-nephrotic primary FSGS. The second trial is an open label, intra-subject dose escalation study in subjects with primary FSGS and nephrotic syndrome. The primary efficacy objective of both trials is to evaluate the effect of CCX140 on proteinuria, as assessed by factors including reduction in proteinuria through the 12-week treatment period. Other study objectives will include the assessment of partial or complete remission and the time to, and proportion of subjects with, partial or complete remission and other variables. Changes in quality-of-life changes (SF-36 v2, EQ-5D-5L) will also be assessed. 
 CCX140 Commercialization Strategy 
 We plan on building a sales infrastructure in the Unites States to commercialize our orphan disease drug candidates such as CCX140. FSGS patients are primarily being treated by nephrologists in so-called centers of excellence in renal diseases. Similar to avacopan, we plan on establishing a commercial presence focused on the nephrology arena. In territories outside of the United States, our partner Vifor will be responsible for the commercialization of CCX140. 
 In December 2016, we entered into a second collaboration and license agreement with Vifor, the CCX140 Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Vifor exclusive rights to commercialize CCX140 in rare renal diseases in markets outside the United States and China. We are responsible for the clinical development of CCX140 in rare renal diseases, while sharing the cost of such development with Vifor. In connection with the CCX140 Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront commitment totaling $50.0 million and are eligible to receive additional payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales based milestones, as well as tiered double-digit royalties on potential net sales of CCX140 in the licensed territories. Under the CCX140 Agreement, Vifor retains an option to solely develop and commercialize CCX140 in more prevalent forms of CKD. Should Vifor later exercise the CKD option, we would receive co-promotion rights in CKD in the United States. In June 2018, we and Vifor entered into the CCX140 Letter Agreement to further expand the Vifor territories under the CCX140 Agreement to provide Vifor with exclusive commercialization rights in China and we

   received a non-refundable $5.0 million payment for the expanded rights. Additionally, in June 2018, we and Vifor entered into an amendment to the CCX140 Agreement, which we refer to as the CCX140 Amendment, to clarify the timing of certain payments with respect to development funding of the CCX140 program by Vifor, and we received a non-refundable payment of $11.5 million. We retain control of ongoing and future development of CCX140 (other than country-specific development in the licensed territories) and all commercialization rights to CCX140 in the United States. 
Early Stage Drug Candidates 
 Immuno-Oncology and Other Therapeutic Areas 
 In oncologic disease, tumors can profoundly subvert inflammatory and effector immune responses. In the tumor cellular microenvironment, CCR2 bearing cells are thought to largely have an immunosuppressive behavior. These are the so-called myeloid derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs. These cells effectively help tumors hide from the bodys cytotoxic immune response to tumor cells. Inhibiting CCR2, and thus the MDSCs controlled by CCR2, could therefore lead to the liberation of the cytotoxic immune response against the tumor cells, tumor shrinkage, and improved patient survival. We have an ongoing clinical development program for the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer with our drug candidate CCX872, our second inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2. 
Understanding Pancreatic Cancer 
 Pancreatic cancer is a rare but deadly cancer. It is the 15th most common cancer worldwide but the fourth highest cause of cancer-related death. In the United States in 2019, approximately 56,770 people are expected to develop pancreatic cancer, and within five years of diagnosis, about 80% of those patients are expected to succumb to the disease. Primarily due to the aging of the population, the incidence of pancreatic cancer is predicted to increase to 62,000 new cases per year by 2030. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which represents 85% of all pancreatic cancers, is characterized by rapid progression and a dismal prognosis. Because of the deep location of the pancreas in the abdomen and the lack of markers of early disease, most cancers remain asymptomatic until they obstruct the biliary tract, which usually occurs with tumors of the pancreatic head, or until they become metastatic. Hence, less than 15% of patients initially present with a resectable cancer (stage 1 or 2), while the majority of patients have either a locally advanced, nonresectable, stage 3 cancer or a metastatic, stage 4 cancer at the time of diagnosis. Even with the best current treatment, the median overall survival of these patients is less than one year, an outlook that has remained largely unchanged over the last few decades. 
 The dismal prognosis of this cancer results from the combination of the late diagnosis, the early metastatic dissemination, and resistance to most chemotherapies. The main factors explaining this resistance to treatment include a very high rate of activation of the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene, mutations, a propensity for both local extension and distal spreading, the presence of a dense stromal tissue surrounding the tumor that results in a hypoxic, hypovascularized environment with high interstitial pressure, which may impede drug delivery, and ultimately the loss of immune control. Therapeutic interventions that improve the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer are urgently needed. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Current SOC regimens are not only limited by modest efficacy but also by significant toxicity. For patients with nonresectable cancer (stage 3 or 4), FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil) or a combination of gemcitabine and nanoparticle albumin-bound-, or nab-, paclitaxel are considered standard treatments, but the median overall survival of patients remains less than one year. Further, these treatments often are poorly tolerated. FOLFIRINOX is associated with a high rate of Grade 3-4 adverse events, can rarely be administered for more than six months, and is mostly prescribed to patients with excellent performance status. Frail, elderly patients usually receive palliative treatment. Extensive research is ongoing to identify novel agents with improved efficacy and a reduced toxicity profile, including chemotherapies with improved formulations of currently available agents, therapies targeted against specific oncogenic pathways, or cancer vaccines.

  Role of CCR2 in Pancreatic Cancer 
 Human pancreatic tumors are characterized by a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment. In the tumor cellular microenvironment, CCR2 bearing cells are thought to be largely of an immunosuppressive behavior; these are the so-called MDSCs. These cells effectively help tumors hide from the bodys cytotoxic immune response to tumor cells. Inhibiting CCR2, and thus the MDSCs controlled by CCR2, could therefore lead to the liberation of the cytotoxic immune response against the tumor cells, and improved patient survival. 
Clinical Development 
 CCX872 is a potent and selective inhibitor of CCR2. The objective of using a CCR2 inhibitor such as CCX872 is to reduce the suppressive myeloid cell presence in the tumor and, in doing so, slow the progression of disease in these patients. We believe that CCX872 may represent a promising novel immunotherapeutic approach. Drugs that block CCR2 have shown evidence of activity in patients with pancreatic cancer as well as in a mouse orthotopic pancreatic cancer model. 
Phase I Clinical Trials 
 We completed a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial in healthy subjects. This clinical trial was a combined single-and-multiple-ascending dose clinical trial in 40 subjects. The clinical trial was conducted in the Netherlands. CCX872 doses of 3mg, 10mg, 30mg, 100mg and 300mg were given as a single dose in the first study period and once-daily doses for seven days in the second study period. Data showed that CCX872 was well-tolerated and appeared to be safe in healthy volunteers at all dose levels studied. There were no serious adverse events or dropouts due to adverse events in the trial. The most common adverse events reported by subjects receiving CCX872 in the multi-dose period were dizziness, diarrhea, and headache. These events typically were mild in intensity and did not result in dosing discontinuation. The results showed that CCX872 was safe and well-tolerated. CCX872 was able to block CCR2 in the circulation, and it had a predictable dose-linear PK profile. 
 Our Phase Ib study for CCX872 explores a novel approach (CCR2 inhibition) for the treatment of patients with stage 3 and 4 pancreatic cancer. Beyond the field of pancreatic cancer, the results of this study will also advance our understanding of the role of chemokines in solid tumors and of the potential for chemokine receptor inhibitors as therapeutic options in cancer patients when combined with SOC regimens. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of orally-administered CCX872 with respect to disease progression in patients with nonresectable pancreatic cancer being treated with FOLFIRINOX, one of the current SOC treatments for this disease. Enrollment in the trial occurred in two stages, Part A (single dose) and Part B (multiple dose). Part A has been completed. Results showed that a single oral dose of 150-mg CCX872 was well-tolerated and safe in this study. The PK profile in patients with pancreatic cancer was in line with the PK profile observed in healthy volunteers in the previous clinical trial. CCX872 was effective in blocking CCR2 in circulating cells as measured by CCR2 occupancy and internalization assays, as well as migration assays. Successful completion of Part A led to initiation of Part B. 
 Enrollment of 50 patients in Part B was completed in 2016. In January 2017, we reported 24-week progression-free survival, or PFS, data, 12-week objective response rate, or ORR, data, and initial overall survival data. PFS rate was 57% at week 24 in the primary analysis population and median PFS was 179 days. ORR was 37% at week 12 in the primary analysis population. Overall survival rate was 52% at week 48 in the primary analysis population and median survival time was 11.5 months. The longest ongoing CCX872 treatment period for a patient in the study to date is 73 weeks (and continuing). CCX872 has been well-tolerated in the clinical trial. There has been no apparent additional safety burden of combining CCX872 with FOLFIRINOX, as evidenced by an incidence and rate of adverse events in the trial to date consistent with data reported historically for FOLFIRINOX on its own.
 In January 2018, we further reported overall survival data at 18 months of 29% for the primary analysis population and 28% in patients with metastatic pancreatic disease. This compares favorably with previously 
 
17

   published data of overall survival of 18.6% at 18 months for FOLFIRINOX regimen alone in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Overall, circulating monocytic myeloid derived cells likely including myeloid suppressor cells were reduced by treatment. 
 Preclinical Development in Immuno-Oncology 
 One of the most exciting advances in oncology in decades is the recent observation that modifiers of the activity of the patients own immune system can profoundly enhance their response to chemotherapy. 
 A critical cellular component of this response are the MDSCs, which inhibit the activity of the effector T cells, and thus dampen the immune response of the body to the tumor. These MDSCs express chemokine and chemoattractant receptors that they use to migrate to the tumor microenvironment. We believe that blocking these chemokine receptors with small molecule antagonists could be effective either as stand-alone therapies for certain cancers or by synergistic effect when given in combination with traditional chemotherapies or other immunotherapies. 
 We have discovered small molecule inhibitors that target these chemoattractant receptors, and one or more of them may be developed in certain oncology indications targeting both solid and liquid tumors. 
 In our preclinical research, we are conducting studies with various chemokine receptor inhibitors in combination with check point inhibitors, such as those inhibiting the programmed cell death-1, or PD-1, programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, pathway, that we believe may result in a greater anti-tumor effect, than with check-point inhibition alone. 
 A growing body of data suggests that a number of chemokine receptors, including, but not limited to, CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR7 and CXCR2, may play diverse roles in cancer growth, cancer metastasis, cancer angiogenesis, or the composition of the tumor microenvironment. Given the potential role of chemokine receptors in cancer cell survival, the combination of chemokine receptor antagonists with traditional chemotherapeutic agents or with immunotherapy, such as PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors is an attractive strategy because it may result in greater efficacy and/or allow dose reductions of the chemotherapeutic drugs and therefore limit systemic side effects. 
 In March 2018, we presented data from in vivo model of colorectal cancer with a selective orally-administered CCR2 inhibitor. We reported that the therapeutic effects of PD-1 therapy are appreciably enhanced by specific blockade of CCR2 via a small molecule inhibitor, CCX598. In this mouse model, the anti-tumor response is specific and long-term survivors are resistant to re-inoculation with the CT26 tumor (even without further dosing of either drug). CCR2 inhibition alters the tumor microenvironment by reducing the number of monocytic-MDSC per gram of tumor. Reduction in tumor size is inversely proportional to the ratio of CD8 T cells to monocytic-MDSCs. 
 In November and December 2018, we presented data from animal models of pancreatic cancer (KCM model) and colorectal cancer (CT26 model) with a selective orally-administered CCR4 inhibitor at two international Cancer Immunology conferences. We reported that specific blockade of CCR4 with a small molecule inhibitor CCX6239 significantly reduced tumor burden and also enhanced the therapeutic effects of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) antibody in the KCM orthotopic pancreatic cancer model. In the colorectal cancer model, CCR4 inhibitor in combination with anti-CTLA-4 antibody also decreased tumor growth and increased the proportion of long-term survivors. In this model, the anti-tumor response was CT26-specific; mice with tumor regression exhibited a high proportion of CD8 T cells that recognized a CT26-specific neoantigen, and long term survivors were resistant to re-inoculation with CT26 cells (without further dosing of either drug). 
 At these same conferences, we for the first time reported the development of a unique class of human PD-L1 small molecule inhibitors. These inhibitors exhibited activity in blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in a variety 
 
18 


Index to Financial Statements
   of biochemical and cell-based assays. This inhibitory effect was at least partially through PD-L1 reduction on the cell surface, a potentially beneficial feature not exhibited by anti-PD-L1 antibodies. In an animal tumor model, our current lead compound CCX4503 reduced tumor growth to a similar extent as the positive control anti-human PD-L1 antibody. The anti-tumor activity was completely dependent on the presence of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and was accompanied by a significantly higher CD8+ T-Cell to CD4+ T-cell ratio. With further optimization, we believe these novel PD-L1 inhibitors would provide a valuable alternative to the current antibody-based PD-1/PD-L1 therapeutics. 
 Other Therapeutic Areas 
 CCX872, a selective orally-administered inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2, demonstrated significant reductions in liver fibrosis in vivo models of NASH, a severe type of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease caused by chronic inflammation that can lead to fibrosis (scarring) of the liver, when compared to either placebo or a separate compound which is a dual inhibitor of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5 currently in clinical development by another party. The data suggest a potential application of CCX872 for the treatment of patients with NASH. NASH affects 3% to 5% of the U.S. population. 
Other Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases 
 Th17 Driven Diseases and CCR6 
 One of the most intriguing areas of current research in immunology involves a relatively recently discovered type of helper T cells known as Th17 cells. There is a large amount of preclinical and clinical data that implicate Th17 cells, as well as Interleukin 17, or IL-17, in the development of a large number of autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and multiple sclerosis. 
 Activated Th17 cells isolated from chronically inflamed human tissues produce high levels of TNF-a and other cytokines. A hallmark of Th17 cells is that they express high levels of the chemokine receptor known as CCR6, which is not found on Th1 and Th2 cells. High levels of the CCR6 chemokine ligand, CCL20, have been found in psoriatic skin, in rheumatoid arthritis joint biopsies, and in asthmatic lungs. 
 We believe that these are potential therapeutic opportunities for a CCR6 inhibitor. We have produced several unique CCR6 inhibitor leads, which are now being optimized through medicinal chemistry approaches and undergoing further evaluation in preclinical pharmacology models. 
 We have shown in preclinical models that an orally bioavailable, small molecule inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR6 confers protection against IL17-mediated inflammation. We have generated potent orally bioavailable CCR6 inhibitors that inhibit CCL20-mediated chemotaxis of both human and mouse CCR6-positive cells. The utility of CCR6 inhibition was tested in preclinical models of psoriasis, and demonstrated that animals treated with our CCR6 inhibitor were protected against imiquimod induced skin thickening. Histological analysis of the skin confirmed the protective effect of our CCR6 inhibitor compared to an aqueous vehicle control and significantly reduced ear-thickening induced by intradermal injections of Interleukin 23, or IL-23, a cytokine that is important for the terminal differentiation and pathogenicity of Th17 cells. 
 The mechanism of action for CCR6 inhibitors is different from other therapeutics targeting IL-17, because inhibition of CCR6 disrupts the recruitment of infiltrating leukocytes into the epidermis upon skin damage, thereby protecting against epidermal hyperplasia, or an abnormal increase in the number of cells on the skin. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of CCR6 with an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor mitigates IL-17-driven inflammation in psoriasis models, and its distinct mechanism of action suggests it may offer additional efficacy when added to current SOC. 
 In April and May 2018, we presented data from in vivo models of psoriasis with a selective orally-administered CCR6 inhibitor. Genetically modified mice demonstrate that psoriatic lesions do not progress in

   mice lacking chemokine receptor CCR6. CCL20, the only known chemokine ligand for CCR6, is highly expressed in psoriatic plaques. Our potent, orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of CCR6 ameliorated skin inflammation in the IL-23 and imiquimod induced models of psoriasis, and in the IL-36 induced model representative of rare form of psoriasis referred to as generalized pustular psoriasis. Results from this work were submitted and accepted to be published as a peer reviewed journal article in the Journal of Immunology in January 2019. CCR6 antagonists present a novel therapeutic approach to treating multiple forms of psoriasis. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, novel biological discoveries, screening and drug development technology and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 As for the pharmaceutical products we develop and commercialize, as a normal course of business, we intend to pursue composition-of-matter patents, where possible, manufacturing, salts and polymorphs, dosage, combinations and formulation patents, as well as method of use patents on novel indications for known compounds. We also seek patent protection with respect to novel biological discoveries, including new targets and applications as well as adjuvant and vaccine candidates. We have also pursued patents with respect to our proprietary screening and drug development processes and technology. We have sought patent protection, either alone or jointly with our collaborators, as our collaboration agreements may dictate. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our patent estate, on a worldwide basis, included approximately 849 issued or allowed patents and approximately 362 pending patent applications, with claims relating to all of our current clinical-stage drug candidates. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 95 issued or allowed patents and 33 patent applications pending for avacopan, our lead drug candidate in the C5aR program. As of December 31, 2018, with respect to our drug candidates in the CCR2 program, we had approximately 78 issued or allowed patents and 67 patents pending worldwide relating to their chemical composition or use thereof. As of December 31, 2018, with respect to the CCR1 and CCR9 chemokine receptors, we had approximately 495 issued or allowed patents and 124 patents pending worldwide relating to their chemical composition or use thereof. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 120 patents issued or pending for our other preclinical-stage compounds in the C5aR, CCR2, CXCR7, CCR4, CXCR2 and CCR6 programs.. 
 Avacopan, our lead drug candidate in the C5aR program, is covered by an issued patent in the United States for the composition-of-matter of avacopan and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, which will expire in 2031 (not including patent term extension that may be available to extend the term of the patent). Avacopan is also covered by an additional issued patent in the United States with an expiration date of 2029. Avacopan is covered by an issued patent in Europe (covering avacopans composition-of-matter, compositions and certain methods of use) with an expiration date of 2029 (not including a supplementary protection certificate that may be available to extend the term of the patent). Additionally, avacopan is covered by issued patents in several jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea and Taiwan. These issued patents will expire in 2029 (not including patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates that may be available in some countries). Patent applications are pending in other countries including Brazil which, if issued, are anticipated to expire in 2029 (not including patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates that may be available). We have patent applications pending covering certain synthetic methods related to making avacopan, which, if issued, are anticipated to expire in 2035. More recent patent application filings in the avacopan family are directed to formulations and methods of use.

  CCX140 is covered by three issued patents in the United States for the composition-of-matter of CCX140 and pharmaceutical compositions thereof that will expire in 2026, 2028 and 2029, respectively (not including patent term extension that may be available to extend the term of the granted patents). CCX140 is also covered by two additional issued patents in the United States (covering certain methods of use) that will expire in 2026 and 2028 respectively. CCX140 is also covered by certain issued patents in Europe (covering CCX140 composition-of-matter and certain methods of use) that will expire in 2026 and 2028, respectively (not including a supplementary protection certificate that may be available to extend the term of the patents). CCX140 is covered by certain issued patents in several jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and South Korea, covering CCX140 composition-of-matter. These issued patents will expire in 2028 (not including patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates that may be available in some countries). We have patent applications pending covering certain methods of use, which, if issued, are anticipated to expire in 2037. 
 CCX872 is covered by two issued patents in the United States for the composition-of-matter of CCX872 and pharmaceutical compositions thereof that will expire in 2026, respectively (not including patent term extension that may be available to extend the term of the granted patents). We have patent applications pending covering certain methods of use, which, if issued, are anticipated to expire in 2037. 
 Nonetheless, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party.
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention. 
 Competition 
 We compete in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address AAV, HS, C3G, FSGS and other renal diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders, and cancer. We face significant competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are also researching and selling products designed to address these markets. Many of our competitors have materially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, research, and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in preclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. 
 
21 


Index to Financial Statements
  It is possible that our competitors will develop and market drugs that are less expensive and more effective than our drug candidates, or that will render our drug candidates obsolete. It is also possible that our competitors will commercialize competing drugs before we or our partners can launch any drugs developed from our drug candidates. 
 Avacopan, our C5aR inhibitor, if approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of AAV, might compete with current treatments, such as steroids, CYC, RTX, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil. If avacopan were approved for the treatment of aHUS, it would potentially compete with eculizumab (Soliris®). If Avacopan is approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of C3G, avacopan might compete with treatments that are in development. If avacopan were approved for the treatment of HS, it would potentially compete with adalimumab (Humira®) or other TNF-alpha antibodies which physician sometimes prescribe off-label for the treatment of HS. 
 CCX140, our first CCR2 inhibitor, if approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of FSGS, might compete with treatments commonly used for type 2 diabetes and hypertension patients, RAAS inhibitors, are commonly prescribed treatments used to reduce blood pressure and preserve kidney function, reducing the progression of the disease. Other commercially available treatment options for FSGS include steroids, RAAS inhibitors, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®, Myortic®), tacrolimus (Prograf®), CYC (Cytoxan®), RTX, ACTHAR®, sirolimus (Rapamycin®, Rapamune®), and Liposorber® LA-15 System. If CCX140 is approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of FSGS, CCX140 might compete with treatments that are in development. 
 CCX872, our second CCR2 inhibitor, if approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, might compete with treatments that are currently available, such as chemotherapeutic drugs including gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, or new treatments in development. 
 Many of these currently approved treatments have notable and common adverse events including liver and bone marrow toxicity, renal toxicity, pneumonitis, immunosuppression, allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases and infections. 
 We expect that competition among any of our drugs approved for sale will be based on various factors, including drug safety and efficacy, prevalence of negative side effects, reliability, ease of administration, availability, price, insurance coverage and reimbursement status and patent position. We believe that our ability to compete depends largely upon our ability to research, develop and commercialize our existing and future drug candidates. Further, we need to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection, develop proprietary technology or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of drugs. Our ability to compete will also be affected by the speed at which we are able to identify and develop, conduct clinical testing and obtain regulatory approvals of our drug candidates. Potential competitors may develop treatments that are more effective and/or safer than our drug candidates or that would make our technology and drug candidates obsolete or non-competitive.
Established pharmaceutical companies that currently sell or are developing drugs in our markets of interest include, but are not limited to, AbbVie, Alexion, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Biogen, Bayer, Elan, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Mallinckrodt, Merck, Merck Serono, Novartis, Pfizer, Retrophin, Roche/Genentech, Sanofi, Takeda and Teva. In addition, in some instances we may face competition from companies that sell generic versions of approved drugs that are part of the current standard of care. Many or all of these established competitors are also involved in research and drug development regarding various chemokine receptors. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which are known to be involved in chemokine and chemoattractant research and related drug development include, but are not limited to, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Takeda, Sanofi, Incyte, Achillion, Alexion, Allergan, Appellis, Omeros, InflaRX, Dimerix, X4 Pharmaceuticals, Mitsubishi Tanabe, Biolinerx, Akari Therapeutics and UCB Pharma, among others. These companies and others also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, and in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

  Manufacturing 
 Our current drug candidates are manufactured using commonly used chemical synthetic and engineering processes using readily available or made to order raw materials. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations to produce our drug candidates in accordance with the FDAs current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, for use in our clinical trials. We currently rely on a single source supplier for our active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, manufacturing requirements for each of our drug candidates and for the manufacturing of drug product. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. We expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies of our compounds. 
 We purchase quantities of our drug candidates from our contract manufacturers pursuant to purchase orders that we place with them. If we were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of drug supply or receive raw materials in a timely manner, or secure the manufacturing and release of drug product by the contract manufacturer, we could be required to delay our ongoing clinical trials as we seek, engage and enable alternative manufacturers, which would be costly and time-consuming. 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, export and import of our drug candidates. 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the FDAs implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before our drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDAs good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Once a pharmaceutical drug candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies 
 
23 


Index to Financial Statements
   to evaluate toxicity in animals. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing the clinical trials to commence or not allowing the clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during drug development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, including the requirements for informed consent. 
 All clinical research performed in the United States in support of an NDA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in accordance with GCP, and so long as the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if necessary. We conducted our PROTECT-1 clinical trial solely at foreign clinical research sites, and we did not have authorization from the FDA under an IND to conduct that clinical trial in the United States. We designed the clinical trial to comply with FDA regulatory requirements for the use of foreign clinical data in support of an NDA. We are pursuing a similar development strategy for CCX140 which has completed a Phase II clinical trial in patients with DN in Europe. One of the Phase II clinical trials with avacopan in patients with AAV has also been conducted in Europe. The second clinical trial with avacopan was conducted in North America. We have open INDs in the United States for avacopan, CCX140, and CCX872. All of our clinical trials are designed to comply with FDA regulatory requirements so that the data from all trials can be used to support a regulatory filing in the United States. We are including the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand in our Phase III study of avacopan in AAV. Other planned studies with avacopan and CCX140 will likely include the United States and Europe, and potentially other geographies. 
 Clinical Trials 
 For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. 
 

 | Phase I clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase II clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 
24 


Index to Financial Statements
  
 | evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications in patients with the disease or condition under study.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase III clinical trials, commonly referred to as pivotal studies, are typically conducted when Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the drug candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase III clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. An exception might be drugs developed for an orphan indication, where smaller clinical trials might be acceptable to the FDA and the EMA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA on the sponsors agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drugs safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 New Drug Applications 
 The results of preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of filing of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a filing decision. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the products continued safety, quality and purity. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory 
 
25 


Index to Financial Statements
   committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or an additional Phase III clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drugs safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Once the FDA approves an NDA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the drug reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such drug or require a recall of any drug already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved drugs which have been commercialized. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 A sponsor may also seek approval of its drug candidates under programs designed to accelerate the FDAs review and approval of NDAs. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a fast track product. Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for submission to the FDA of the remaining information. In some cases, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Approvals of this kind, referred to as accelerated approvals, typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase IV clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect of the clinical endpoint. 
 In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established a category of drugs referred to as breakthrough therapies that may be subject to accelerated approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drug candidates designed to prevent, diagnose, or treat serious diseases or conditions may also be eligible for priority review, or review within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete NDA for a new molecular entity is accepted for filing, if a sponsor shows that its drug candidate, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over existing therapies. Fast track designation, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation and 
 
26 


Index to Financial Statements
   priority review do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. When appropriate, we intend to seek fast track designation, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review, as applicable, for our drug candidates. 
Orphan Drug Designation 
 In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition. Such diseases and conditions are those that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if they affect more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for these types of diseases or conditions will be recovered from sales of the drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by that agency. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but it can lead to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. 
 If a drug that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity generally prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, including if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines same drug as a drug that contains the same active chemical entity and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug marketing exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union, or EU, are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (i) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (ii) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. 
 The ten-year market exclusivity in the EU may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:

 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the products labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers communications regarding off-label use.

  Healthcare Reform 
 In March 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse, which have impacted existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act: 

 | imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell branded prescription drugs to specified federal government programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | mandated a further shift in the burden of Medicaid payments to the states;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, once empaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect that the current presidential administration and U.S. Congress will seek to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Since taking office, President Trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the Affordable Care Act. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect additional challenges and amendments in the future. Moreover, the Trump Administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the Affordable Care Act, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Jobs Act, was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trumps administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, was enacted, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently, there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring

   more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. The full impact on our business of the Affordable Care Act and other new laws is uncertain. Nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the demand for our drugs if commercialized. 
 Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Although none of our drug candidates has been commercialized for any indication, if they are approved for marketing, commercial success of our drug candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state, and private levels. Government payor programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost-containment. Ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems. Examples of how limits on drug coverage and reimbursement in the United States may cause reduced payments for drugs in the future include: 
 

 | changing Medicare reimbursement methodologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | fluctuating decisions on which drugs to include in formularies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | revising drug rebate calculations under the Medicaid program; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | reforming drug importation laws.
--+---------------------------------

 Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our drug candidates and operate profitably. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
 We are also subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

 | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $100,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to ten years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;

 | federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act qui

tam actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as whistleblowers, may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal Physician Sunshine Act, which requires certain applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, to report annually to CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, which is defined broadly to include other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations, to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of $11,278 per failure up to an aggregate of $169,170 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.127 million per year for knowing failures), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations;

 | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements. Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties up to $57,051 per violation, not to exceed $1.71 million per calendar year for non-compliance of an identical provision, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. State attorneys general can also bring a civil action to enjoin a HIPAA violation or to obtain statutory damages on behalf of residents of his or her state; and

 | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

International Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain 
 
31 


Index to Financial Statements
   FDA approval for a drug, we must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 
 Under the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 28 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under the Centralized, Mutual Recognition, Decentralized or national EEA member state procedures. The Centralized Procedure provides for the grant of a single marking authorization that is valid for all member states of the EEA. The Mutual Recognition Procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marking authorization may submit an application to the remaining Member States. Under the Decentralized Procedure, if the product has not received a marketing authorization in any EEA member state at the time of application, the applicant can file an application to various EEA member states (choosing once as the so-called reference member states) of its choice which will be reviewed and approved simultaneously by them. 
 In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future drugs. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 76 full-time employees, 31 of whom hold Ph.D.s, M.D.s or both.
