Item 1.Business
Overview
Forbes Energy Services Ltd., or FES Ltd., is an independent oilfield services contractor that provides a wide range of well site services to oil and natural gas drilling and producing companies to help develop and enhance the production of oil and natural gas. These services include well maintenance, completion services, workovers and re-completions, plugging and abandonment, tubing testing, fluid hauling and fluid disposal. Our operations are concentrated in the major onshore oil and natural gas producing regions of Texas, plus one location in Pennsylvania. We believe that our broad range of services, which extends from initial drilling, through production, to eventual abandonment, is fundamental to establishing and maintaining the flow of oil and natural gas throughout the life cycle of our customers’ wells. Our headquarters and executive offices are located at 3000 South Business Highway 281, Alice, Texas 78332. We can be reached by phone at (361) 664-0549.
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the “Company,” “we,” and “our” mean FES Ltd. and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated.
On January 22, 2017, FES Ltd. and its then domestic subsidiaries, or collectively, the Debtors, filed voluntary petitions, or the Bankruptcy Petitions, for reorganization under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas-Corpus Christi Division, or the Bankruptcy Court, pursuant to the terms of a restructuring support agreement that contemplated the reorganization of the Debtors pursuant to a prepackaged plan of reorganization, as amended and supplemented, the Plan. On March 29, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan. On April 13, 2017, or the Effective Date, the Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and the Debtors emerged from their chapter 11 cases.
As discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we applied fresh start accounting upon emergence from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, which resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. The effects of the Plan and the application of fresh start accounting are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements from and after April 13, 2017 (Successor). References to the "Successor" pertain to the Company from and after the Effective Date. References to "Predecessor" pertain to the Company prior to the Effective Date.
On November 16, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Cretic Energy Services, LLC (Cretic). Cretic provides coiled tubing services to E&P companies in the United States, primarily in the Permian Basin in Texas . The total consideration we paid for this acquisition was approximately $69.4 million in cash. We funded the Cretic acquisition with $50.0 million in proceeds from our Bridge Loan, $10.0 million addition to our Term Loan Agreement and cash, cash equivalents and cash-restricted on hand. We believe this acquisition has significantly enhanced our coiled tubing services and our position in the Permian Basin. See Note 4 - Acquisition of Cretic Energy Services, LLC to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on From 10-K for further discussion regarding the acquisition of Cretic.
We provide a wide range of services to a diverse group of companies. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we provided services to 563 companies. John E. Crisp, Steve Macek and our senior management team have cultivated deep and ongoing relationships with these customers during their combined experience of over 40 years in the oilfield services industry. Similarly, Joe Michetti, who headed Cretic prior to our acquisition, has 26 years of experience in the oilfield services industry.
We conduct our operations through the following three business segments:

• | Well Servicing. Our well servicing segment comprised 45.9% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our well servicing segment utilizes our fleet of well servicing rigs, which at December 31, 2018 was comprised of 150 workover rigs and 13 swabbing rigs and other related assets and equipment. These assets are used to provide (i) well maintenance, including remedial repairs and removal and replacement of downhole production equipment, (ii) well workovers, including significant downhole repairs, re-completions and re-perforations, (iii) completion and swabbing activities, (iv) plugging and abandonment services, and (v) pressure testing of oil and natural gas production tubing and scanning tubing for pitting and wall thickness using tubing testing units.


• | Coiled Tubing. Our coiled tubing segment comprised 21.9% or our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. This segment utilizes our fleet of 15 coiled tubing units, of which 11 are large diameter units (2 3/8” or larger). These units provide a range of services accomplishing a wide variety of goals including horizontal completions, well bore clean-outs and maintenance, nitrogen services, thru-tubing services, formation stimulation using acid and other chemicals, and other pre- and post-hydraulic fracturing well preparation services. 


• | Fluid Logistics. Our fluid logistics segment comprised 32.2% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our fluid logistics segment utilizes our fleet of owned or leased fluid transport trucks and related assets, including specialized vacuum, high-pressure pump and tank trucks, hot oil trucks, frac tanks, fluid mixing tanks, salt

1

water disposal wells and facilities, and related equipment. These assets are used to provide, transport, store, and dispose of a variety of drilling and produced fluids used in, and generated by, oil and natural gas production. These services are required in most workover and completion projects and are routinely used in daily operations of producing wells. 
We believe that our three business segments are complementary and create synergies in terms of selling opportunities. Our multiple lines of service are designed to capitalize on our existing customer base to grow it within existing markets, generate more business from existing customers, and increase our operating performance. By offering our customers the ability to reduce the number of vendors they use, we believe that we help improve our customers’ efficiency. This is demonstrated by the fact that 65.2% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were from customers that utilized services of two of our business segments. Further, by having multiple service offerings that span the life cycle of the well, we believe that we have a competitive advantage over smaller competitors offering more limited services.
The following table summarizes the number of locations and major components of our equipment fleet at December 31, 2018:

Corporate Structure
FES Ltd. was initially organized as a Bermuda exempt company on April 9, 2008. On August 12, 2011, FES Ltd. discontinued its existence as a Bermuda entity and converted into a Texas corporation, or the Texas Conversion. FES Ltd. has been and is the holding company for all of our operations. Forbes Energy Services LLC, or FES LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FES Ltd. that acts as an intermediate holding company for our direct and indirect wholly-owned operating companies that have conducted our business historically: C.C. Forbes, LLC, or CCF, TX Energy Services, LLC, or TES, Forbes Energy International, LLC, or FEI, and since its acquisition effective November 16, 2018, Cretic.
Under the Plan, all of FES Ltd.’s previously outstanding equity interests, which included FES Ltd.’s prior common stock, par value $0.04 per share, or the Old Common Stock, FES Ltd.’s prior preferred stock, awards under FES Ltd.’s prior incentive compensation plans, and the preferred stock purchase rights under the rights agreement dated as of May 19, 2008, as subsequently amended on July 8, 2013, between FES Ltd. and CIBC Mellon Trust Company, as rights agent, in FES Ltd. were extinguished without recovery, FES Ltd. was "converted" to a Delaware corporation and FES Ltd. created a new class of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, or the New Common Stock.
On May 18, 2017, shares of the New Common Stock were authorized for trading on the Over-The-Counter Pink Market. On May 19, 2017, OTC Markets Group Inc. announced that the New Common Stock was qualified to trade on the OTCQX Best Market. On May 19, 2017, the New Common Stock began trading on the OTCQX Best Market under the symbol “FLSS.”
Our Competitive Position
We believe that the following competitive strengths position us well within the oilfield services industry:

• | Exposure to Revenue Streams Throughout the Life Cycle of the Well. Our maintenance and workover services give us exposure to demand from our customers throughout the life cycle of a well, from drilling through production and eventual abandonment. Each new well that is drilled provides us a potential multi-year stream of well servicing revenue,

2

as our customers attempt to maximize and maintain a well’s productivity. Accordingly, demand for our production services is generally driven by the total number of producing wells in a region and is generally less volatile than demand for new well drilling services.

• | High Level of Customer Retention. Our top customers include many of the largest integrated and independent oil and natural gas companies operating onshore in the United States. We believe that our success comes from growing in our existing markets with existing customers due to the quality of our well servicing rigs, our personnel, and our safety record. We believe members of our senior management team have maintained excellent working relationships with our top customers in the United States with their combined experience in the oilfield services industry. We believe the complementary nature of our three business segments also helps us to retain customers because of the efficiency we offer a customer with multiple needs at the wellsite. Notably, 65.2% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were from customers that utilize services in two of our business segments. Further, by having multiple service offerings that span the life cycle of the well, we believe that we have a competitive advantage over smaller competitors offering more limited services.


• | Industry-Leading Safety Record. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had approximately 22.7% fewer reported incidents than the industry average as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We believe that our safety record and reputation are critical factors to purchasing and operations managers in their decision-making process. We have a strong safety culture based on our training programs and safety seminars for our employees and customers. For example, for several years, members of our senior management have played an integral part in joint safety training meetings with customer personnel. In addition, our deployment of new well servicing rigs with enhanced safety features has contributed to our strong safety record and reputation.


• | Experienced Senior Management Team and Operations Staff. Our executive operations management team of John E. Crisp, Steve Macek and, since November 16, 2018, Joe Michetti, have over 100 years of combined experience within the oilfield services industry. In addition, our next level of management, which includes our division, regional and location managers, has an average of over 38 years of experience in the industry.

Our Business Strategy
Our strategy in this rapidly changing market:

• | Maintain Maximum Asset Utilization. We constantly monitor asset usage and industry trends as we strive to maximize utilization. We accomplish this through moving assets from regions with less activity to those with more activity or that are increasing in activity. We are focusing on basins that are either predominantly oil or contain natural gas with high liquids content, such as the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Eagle Ford Basin in South Texas. Although industry activity has stabilized, and is on an upward trajectory in most basins, drilling techniques have resulted in the need for less equipment for well completions or fewer hours for the equipment being used. This has directly impacted our utilization. In response, we continue to minimize costs by concentrating utilization in as few active assets as possible while eliminating or substantially reducing our operating expenses on the inactive assets.


• | Maintain a Presence in Proven and Established Oil and Liquids Rich Basins. We focus our operations on customers that operate in well-established basins which have proven production histories and that have maintained a high level of activity throughout various oil and natural gas pricing environments. While a substantial amount of our business is in the completion area, the majority of our business is production-related. We believe production-related services help create a more stable revenue stream, as these services are tied more to producing wells and less to drilling activity. Our experience shows that historically, production-related services tend to withstand depressed economic or industry conditions better than completion services.


• | Establish and Maintain Leadership Position in Core Operating Areas. Based on our estimates, we believe that we have a significant market share in well servicing and fluid logistics in South Texas. We strive to establish and maintain significant positions within each of our core operating areas. To achieve this goal, we maintain close customer relationships and offer high-quality services to our customers. In addition, our significant presence in our core operating areas facilitates employee retention, hiring and brand recognition.


• | Maintain a Disciplined Growth Strategy. We strategically evaluate opportunities for growth and expansion when customer demand dictates and dedicate the capital and staffing to respond. Conversely, we continually evaluate the viability and economics of our existing locations to ensure an efficient use of our management time and working capital. In some cases, this may result in closing a location or locations, reducing middle management, and reducing headcount. We believe both of these initiatives are necessary in order for the Company to be competitive in the current market environment.

Description of Business Segments
Well Servicing Segment
Through our fleet of 163 well servicing rigs, which was comprised of 150 workover rigs and 13 swabbing rigs, as of December 31, 2018, located in 11 operational areas across Texas and one in Pennsylvania, we provide a comprehensive offering of well services to oil and natural gas companies, including completions of newly drilled oil and natural gas wells, wellbore maintenance, workovers and recompletions, tubing testing, and plugging and abandonment services. As a result of the downturn, 81 rigs were stacked at December 31, 2018. Our well servicing rig fleet has an average age of less than eleven years. As part of our operational strategy, we enhanced our design specifications to improve the operational and safety characteristics of our well servicing rigs compared with some of the older well servicing rigs operated by others in the industry. These include increased derrick height and weight ratings and increased mud pump horsepower. We believe these enhanced features translate into increased demand for our equipment and services along with better pricing for our equipment and personnel. In addition, we augment our well servicing rig fleet with auxiliary equipment, such as mud pumps, power swivels, mud plants, mud tanks, blow-out preventers, lighting plants, generators, pipe racks, and tongs, which results in incremental rental revenue and increases financial performance of a typical well servicing job.
We provide the following services in our well servicing segment:

• | Completions. Utilizing our well servicing rig fleet, we perform completion services, which involve wellbore cleanout, well prepping for fracturing, drilling, setting and retrieving plugs, fishing operations, tool conveyance and logging, cementing, well unloading, casing and packer testing, pump-down plug, velocity strings, perforating, acidizing and/or stimulating a wellbore, along with swabbing operations that are utilized to clean a wellbore prior to production. Completion services are generally shorter term in nature and involve our equipment operating on a site for a period of two to three days, although some fishing jobs, which involve the recovery of equipment lost or stuck in the wellbore, can take longer.


• | Maintenance. Through our fleet of well servicing rigs, we provide for the removal and repair of sucker rods, downhole pumps, and other production equipment, repair of failed production tubing, and removal of sand, paraffin, and other downhole production-related byproducts that impair well performance. These operations typically involve our well servicing rigs operating on a wellsite for five to seven days.


• | Workovers and Recompletions. We provide workover and re-completion services for existing wellbores. These services are designed to significantly enhance production by re-perforating to initiate or re-establish productivity from an oil or natural gas wellbore. In addition, we provide major downhole repairs such as casing repair, production tubing replacement, and deepening and sidetracking operations used to extend a wellbore laterally or vertically. These operations are typically longer term in nature and involve our well servicing rigs operating on a wellsite for one to two weeks at a time.


• | Tubing Testing. Our downhole tubing testing services allow operators to verify tubing integrity. Tubing testing services are performed as production tubing is run into a new wellbore or on older wellbores as production tubing is replaced during a workover operation. In addition to our downhole testing units, our electromagnetic scan trucks scan tubing while out of the wellbore. This scanning function provides key operational information related to corrosion pitting, holes and splits, and wall loss on tubing. Tubing testing services complement our other service offerings and provide a significant opportunity for cross-selling.


• | Plugging and Abandonment. Our well servicing rigs are also used in the process of permanently closing oil and natural gas wells that are no longer capable of producing in economic quantities, become mechanically impaired or are dry holes. Plugging and abandonment work can be performed with a well servicing rig along with wireline and cementing equipment; however, this service is typically provided by companies that specialize in plugging and abandonment work. Many well operators bid this work on a “lump sum” basis to include the sale or disposal of equipment salvaged from the well as part of the compensation received.

Coiled Tubing Segment
Our fleet of 15 coiled tubing units is comprised of 11 large diameter units (2 3/8” and larger) and four smaller diameter units.  Seven of the large diameter units were acquired with the acquisition of Cretic as disclosed in Note 4 - Acquisition of Cretic Energy Services LLC. Our high capacity fleet can accommodate optimally designed work strings that are the size and length to efficiently meet the long lateral requirements in the most challenging well bores. The units are utilized in a wide range of well completion and intervention operations. The services offered are customized to the customer's job specific requirements. Our coiled tubing fleet has an average age of less than 7 years.
We provide the following services in our coiled tubing segment:

• | Completions. Utilizing our coiled tubing fleet, we perform completion services, which involve wellbore cleanout, well prepping for fracturing, fishing operations, tool conveyance and logging, cementing, well unloading, casing and packer testing, pump-down plug, velocity strings, perforating, acidizing and/or stimulating a wellbore. Completion services are generally shorter term in nature and involve our equipment operating on a site for a period of two to three days, although some fishing jobs, which involve the recovery of equipment lost or stuck in the wellbore, can take longer.


• | Maintenance. Through our fleet of coiled tubing units, we provide for removal of scale, sand, paraffin, and other downhole production-related byproducts that impair well performance. These operations typically involve our coiled tubing equipment operating on a wellsite for five to seven days.


• | Workovers and Recompletions. We provide workover and recompletion services for existing wellbores. These services are designed to significantly enhance production by re-perforating to initiate or re-establish productivity from an oil or natural gas wellbore. These operations are typically longer term in nature and involve our coiled tubing units operating on a wellsite for one to two weeks at a time.

Fluid Logistics Segment
Our fluid logistics segment provides an integrated array of oilfield fluid sales, transportation, storage, and disposal services that are required on most workover, drilling, and completion projects and are routinely used in daily operations of producing wells by oil and natural gas producers. We have a substantial operational footprint with 11 fluid logistics locations across Texas as of December 31, 2018, and an extensive fleet of transportation trucks, high-pressure pump trucks, hot oil trucks, frac tanks, fluid mixing tanks and salt water disposal wells. This combination of services enables us to provide a one-stop source for oil and natural gas companies. Although there are some large operators in our areas with whom we compete, we believe that the vast majority of our smaller competitors in this segment can provide some, but not all, of the equipment and services required by customers, thereby requiring our customers to use several companies to meet their requirements and increasing their administrative burden. In addition, by pursuing an integrated approach to service, we experience increased asset utilization rates, as multiple assets are usually required to service a customer.
We provide the following services in our fluid logistics segment:

• | Fluid Hauling. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 249 fluid service vacuum trucks, trailers, and other hauling trucks equipped with a fluid hauling capacity of up to 150 barrels per unit, with most of the units having a capacity of 130 barrels. As a result of the industry downturn, 21 trucks and trailers were stacked at December 31, 2018. Each fluid service truck unit is equipped to pump fluids from or into wells, pits, tanks, and other on-site storage facilities. The majority of our fluid service truck units are also used to transport water to fill frac tanks on well locations, including frac tanks provided by us and others, to transport produced salt water to disposal wells, including injection wells owned and/or operated by us, and to transport drilling and completion fluids to and from well locations. In conjunction with frac tank rentals, we use fluid service trucks to transport water for use by our customers in fracturing operations. Following completion of fracturing operations by our customers, our fluid service trucks are used to transport the flowback produced as a result of the fracturing operations from the wellsite to disposal wells. We also operate several hot oil trucks which are capable of providing heated water and oil for use in well and pipe maintenance.


• | Disposal Services. Most oil and natural gas wells produce varying amounts of salt water throughout their productive lives. Under Texas law, oil and natural gas waste and salt water produced from oil and natural gas wells are required to be disposed of in authorized facilities, including permitted salt water disposal wells. Disposal, or injection, wells are licensed by state authorities and are completed in permeable formations below the fresh water table. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 15 disposal wells in 13 locations across Texas, with an aggregate injection capacity of approximately 196,000 barrels per day. The wells are permitted to dispose of salt water and incidental non-hazardous oil and natural gas wastes throughout our operational bases in Texas. It is our intent to locate the salt water disposal wells in close proximity to the producing wells of our customers. Although, in the normal course of production development, it is not uncommon for drilling and production activity to migrate closer to or farther away from our disposal wells. We maintain separators at all of our disposal wells that permit us to reclaim residual crude oil that we sell.


• | Equipment Rental. As of December 31, 2018, we owned a fleet of 2,834 fluid storage tanks that can store up to 500 barrels of fluid each. This equipment is used by oilfield operators to store various fluids at the wellsite, including fresh water, brine and acid for frac jobs, flowback, temporary production, and drilling fluids. We transport the tanks with our trucks to well locations that are usually within a 75-mile radius of our nearest location. Frac tanks are used during all phases of the life of a producing well. A typical fracturing operation conducted by a customer can be completed within four days using five to 40 or more frac tanks. We believe we maintain one of the youngest frac tank fleets in the industry with an average equipment age of approximately eight years.


• | Fluid Sales. We sell and transport a variety of chemicals and fluids used in drilling, completion, and workover operations for oil and natural gas wells. Although this is a relatively small percentage of our overall business, the provision of

5

these chemicals and fluids increases utilization of and enhances revenues from the associated equipment. Through these services, we provide fresh water used in fracturing fluid, completion fluids, cement, and drilling mud. In addition, we provide potassium chloride for completion fluids, brine water, and water-based drilling mud.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding financial information by segment and geographic location.
Seasonality and Cyclical Trends
Our operations are impacted by seasonal factors. Historically, our business has been negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather, fewer daylight hours, and holidays. We also typically experience a significant slowdown during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons. Our well servicing rigs are mobile and we operate a significant number of oilfield vehicles. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may not be able to move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to generate rig or truck hours. In addition, the majority of our well servicing rigs work only during daylight hours. In the winter months, as daylight time becomes shorter, the amount of time that the well servicing rigs work is shortened, which has a negative impact on total hours worked.
In addition, the oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices. Such cyclical trends also include the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and workover budget.
Sales Organization
Our sales structure is primarily decentralized where each of our business regions cultivates and maintains relationships with customer representatives who manage operations in their respective regions. At the regional level, management maintains relationships with key personnel in the operators' branch or division offices and in each business unit function. In the field, regional managers, yard managers and supervisors are the primary point of contact for sales to operator field representatives. At the corporate level, our Chief Executive Officer and Director of Business Development work with account managers who are assigned to our larger customers, act as liaison between customer contacts, including purchasing managers and the appropriate contacts within each function of the Forbes organization. Sales representatives typically serve multiple roles and in that way are involved in most aspects of the sales cycle, from order fulfillment to billing. Our customers represent both large and small independent oil and natural gas companies that are largely managed at the field level, and depending on the structure, have corporate procurement groups also coordinating supply chain decisions. These corporate procurement groups are the primary focus of our designated sales personnel. We cross-market our well servicing rigs along with our fluid logistics services, thereby offering our customers the ability to minimize vendors, which we believe improves the efficiency of our customers. This is demonstrated by the fact that 65.2% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were from customers that utilized services of two of our business segments.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,178 employees. 
We provide comprehensive employee training and implement recognized standards for health and safety. None of our employees are represented by a union or employed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or similar arrangement. We have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages, and we believe we have good relations with our employees. 
Continued retention of existing qualified management and field employees and availability of additional qualified management and field employees will be a critical factor in our continued success as we work to ensure that we have adequate levels of experienced personnel to service our customers. 
Competition
Our competition includes small regional service providers as well as larger companies with operations throughout the continental United States and internationally. Our larger competitors are Basic Energy Services, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc., Key Energy Services, Inc., C&J Energy Services, Inc., and Stallion Oilfield Services, Ltd. Because of their size, we believe these companies market a large portion of their work to the major oil and natural gas companies. In addition to rates, we compete primarily on the basis of the age and quality of our equipment, our safety record, the quality and expertise of our employees, and our responsiveness to customer needs.

Customers
We served 563 customers for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our largest customer comprised approximately 14.1% of our total revenues; our five largest customers comprised approximately 44.2% of our total revenues; and our ten largest customers comprised approximately 54.6% of our total revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Conoco Phillips, Chesapeake Energy and EOG Resources made up 14.1%, 10.3%, and 8.3% of our total revenues, respectively. The loss of our largest customer or of several of the customers in the top ten would materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. There can be no assurance that lost revenues could be replaced in a timely manner or at all.
We have master service agreements in place with most of our customers, under which jobs or projects are awarded on the basis of price, type of service, location of equipment, and the experience level of work crews. Our business segments charge customers by the hour, by the day, or by the project for the services, equipment, and personnel we provide.
Suppliers
We purchase well servicing chemicals, drilling fluids, and related supplies from various third-party suppliers. Although we do not have written agreements with any of our suppliers (other than leases with respect to certain equipment), we have not historically suffered from an inability to purchase or lease equipment or purchase raw materials.
Insurance
Our operations are subject to risks inherent in the oilfield services industry, such as equipment defects, malfunctions, failures and natural disasters. In addition, hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations, pressures, blow-outs, fires or other conditions may be encountered in drilling and servicing wells, as well as the transportation of fluids and our assets between locations. We have obtained insurance coverage against certain of these risks which we believe is customary in the industry. We have $100 million of liability coverage. Our general liability policy is self-insured up to $250 thousand for each occurrence. We also make estimates and accrue for amounts related to deductibles or self-insured retentions. Such insurance is subject to coverage limits and exclusions and may not be available for all of the risks and hazards to which we are exposed. In addition, no assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate to cover our liabilities or will be generally available in the future or, if available, that premiums will be commercially justifiable. If we incur substantial liability and such damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, or if we incur such liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States pertaining to health, safety, and the environment. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent over the years, and in certain circumstances may impose strict, joint and several liability, rendering us potentially liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on our part and for environmental response costs for which others have contributed. Moreover, cleanup costs, penalties, and other damages arising as a result of new, or changes to existing, environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We believe that we conduct our operations in substantial compliance with current federal, state, and local requirements related to health, safety and the environment. There were no known material environmental liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations to which our operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial position. See Item 1A beginning on page 10 of this Annual Report for further details on the following: Risk Factors— Due to the nature of our business, we may be subject to environmental liability.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, or CERCLA, and comparable state laws in the United States impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain defined persons, including current and prior owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site and entities that selected and transported the hazardous substances to the site. Under CERCLA, these responsible persons may be assigned strict joint and severed liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In the course of our operations, we handle materials that are regulated as hazardous substances and, as a result, may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs. Because of the expansive definition of "responsible parties" under CERCLA, we could be held liable for releases of hazardous substances that resulted from third party operations not under our control or for releases related to practices performed by us or others that were industry standard and in compliance with existing laws and regulations. Also, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of or exposure to hazardous substances or other pollutants.
7

We also handle solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes. Certain materials generated in the exploration, development, or production of crude oil and natural gas are excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulation under RCRA Subtitle C, but may be subject to regulation as a solid waste under RCRA Subtitle D. Moreover, these wastes, which include wastes currently generated during our operations, could be designated as “hazardous wastes” in the future and become subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating expenses.
Although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past, or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for treatment or disposal. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination, pay for associated natural resource damages, or pay significant monetary penalties for such releases.
Water Discharges
We operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the Clean Water Act, as amended, or CWA, and analogous state laws that impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Pursuant to these laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States, including to discharge storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure requirements under the CWA require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill. The CWA can impose substantial civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. We believe that our disposal and equipment cleaning facilities are in substantial compliance with CWA requirements.
Air Emissions
Our facilities and operations are also subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and analogous state and local laws and regulations for air emissions. Changes in and scheduled implementation of these laws could lead to the imposition of new air pollution control requirements for our operations. Therefore, we may incur future capital expenditures to upgrade or modify air pollution control equipment or come into compliance where needed. The EPA promulgated new source performance standards regulating methane emissions from the oil and gas sector in June 2016. These regulations require a reduction in methane emissions from new and modified infrastructure and equipment in the oil and gas sector, including the drilling of new wells, by up to 45% from 2012 levels by the year 2025. The Trump Administration has, however, indicated disapproval of the regulations and is expected to repeal, withdraw, or significantly modify the new source performance standards in the upcoming year. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with CAA requirements.
Employee Health and Safety
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and citizens. In addition, OSHA requires that certain safety measures such as hazard controls and employee training be implemented to prevent employee exposure to safety and health hazards and dangerous conditions at oil and gas sites. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements.
Climate Change Regulation
Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on our operations and financial results. International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies, and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for services that we currently provide and adversely affect our operations and financial results. The ultimate financial impact associated with compliance with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in those jurisdictions and market conditions.
Other Laws and Regulations
We operate salt water disposal wells that are subject to the CWA, Safe Drinking Water Act, and state and local laws and regulations, including those established by the EPA’s Underground Injection Control Program which establishes the minimum program requirements. Our salt water disposal wells are located in Texas, which requires us to obtain a permit to operate each of these wells. We have such permits for each of our operating salt water disposal wells. The Texas regulatory agency may suspend, modify, or terminate any of these permits if such well operation is likely to result in pollution of fresh water, substantial violation of permit conditions or applicable rules, contributes to seismic activity or leaks to the environment. We maintain insurance against 
8

some risks associated with our well service activities, but there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. In addition, hydraulic fracturing practices have come under increased scrutiny in recent years as various regulatory bodies and public interest groups investigate the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on fresh water sources. Risks associated with potential regulation of hydraulic fracturing are discussed in more detail under Item 1A. Risk Factors: Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased cost and additional operating restrictions or delays.
