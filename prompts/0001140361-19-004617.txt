ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL
 
Community West Bancshares or CWBC, a California corporation, is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or “BHCA,” with corporate headquarters in Goleta, California.  Our principal business is to serve as the holding company for our wholly-owned subsidiary Community West Bank, N.A., a national banking association chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).  Through CWB, the Company provides a variety of financial products and services to customers through eight full-service branch offices in the cities of Goleta, Oxnard, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, Ventura, Paso Robles and Westlake Village, California.
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
CWB is focused on relationship-based business banking to small to medium-sized businesses and their owners in the communities served by its branch offices.  The products and services provided include deposit products such as checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and fixed rate, fixed maturity certificates of deposits, cash management products, and lending products including; commercial, commercial real estate and consumer loans.
 
Competition in our markets remains healthy.  The Company continues to be competitive due to its focus on high quality customer service and our experienced relationship bankers who have strong relationships within the communities we serve.
 
Manufactured Housing
 
The Company has a financing program for manufactured housing to provide affordable home ownership.  These loans are offered in approved mobile home parks throughout California primarily on or near the coast.  The parks must meet specific criteria. The manufactured housing loans are secured by the manufactured home and are retained in the Company’s loan portfolio.
Agricultural Loans for Real Estate and Operating Lines
 
The Company has an agricultural lending program for agricultural land, agricultural operational lines, and agricultural term loans for crops, equipment and livestock.  These loan products are partially guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), Farm Service Agency (“FSA”), and the USDA Business and Industry loan program.  The FSA loans typically issue a 90% guarantee up to $1,750,000 (amount adjusted annually based on inflation) for up to 40 years.

Small Business Administration Lending
 
CWB has been a preferred lender/servicer of loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) since 1990. The Company originates SBA loans which can be sold into the secondary market.  The Company continues to service these loans after sale and is required under the SBA programs to retain specified amounts.  The primary SBA loan program that CWB offers is the Section 504 (“504”) program.
 
CWB also offers Business & Industry ("B & I") loans. These loans are similar to the SBA product, except they are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The maximum guaranteed amount is 80%. B&I loans are made to businesses in designated rural areas and are generally larger loans to larger businesses than the 7(a) loans. Similar to the SBA 7(a) product, they can be sold into the secondary market.
 
As a Preferred Lender, CWB has been delegated the loan approval, closing and most servicing and liquidation responsibility from the SBA.
 
Loans to One Borrower
 
State banking law generally limits the amount of funds that a bank may lend to a single borrower. Under federal law, the unsecured obligations of any one borrower to a national bank generally may not exceed 15% of the sum of the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, and the secured and unsecured obligations of any one borrower. CWB was approved to increase this lending limit under the OCC’s Special Lending Limits Program to 25%. This program ensures that national bank lending limits such as CWB’s would remain competitive with state-chartered banks.
Foreign Operations
 
The Company has no foreign operations. The Bank may provide loans, letters of credit and other trade-related services to commercial enterprises that conduct business outside the United States.
Customer Concentration
 
The Company does not have any customer relationships that individually account for 10% of consolidated or segment revenues, respectively.
 
COMPETITION
 
The financial services industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, and offer a broader range of financial services than we can offer and may have lower cost structures.
 
This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of long term changes in regulation that made mergers and geographic expansion easier; changes in technology and product delivery systems and web-based tools; the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers; and the flight of deposit customers to perceived increased safety. We compete for customers related to loans and deposits and customers with other banks, credit unions, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, and other non-bank financial services providers. This strong competition for deposit and loan products directly affects the rates of those products and the terms on which they are offered to consumers.
 
Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets.
 
Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks to consolidate their operations, reduce expenses and increase revenues to remain competitive. The competitive environment is also significantly impacted by federal and state legislation that makes it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with the Company.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 139 full-time equivalent team members. The Company's employees are not represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that its employee relations are good.

GOVERNMENT POLICIES
 
The Company’s operations are affected by various state and federal legislative changes and by regulations and policies of various regulatory authorities, including those of the states in which it operates and the U.S. government. These laws, regulations and policies include, for example, statutory maximum legal lending rates, domestic monetary policies by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System which impact interest rates, U.S. fiscal policy, anti-terrorism and money laundering legislation and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by bank regulatory agencies.
