Item 1. Business
Our Company
We incorporated as Helen of Troy Corporation in Texas in 1968 and were reorganized as Helen of Troy Limited in Bermuda in 1994. We are a leading global consumer products company offering creative products and solutions for our customers through a diversified portfolio of brands. We have built leading market positions through new product innovation, product quality and competitive pricing. We go to market under a number of brands, some of which are licensed. Our Leadership Brands are brands which have number-one or number-two positions in their respective categories and include the OXO, Hydro Flask, Osprey, Vicks, Braun, Honeywell, PUR, Hot Tools and Drybar brands.
Segment Information
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we changed the names of two of our segments to align with the growth in certain product offerings and brands within our portfolio. Our previously named “Housewares” segment was changed to “Home & Outdoor,” and our previously named “Health & Home” segment was changed to “Health & Wellness.” There were no changes to the products or brands included within the segments as part of these name changes. The Osprey brand and products were added to the Home & Outdoor segment upon the completion of the acquisition of Osprey Packs, Inc. ("Osprey") discussed further below.
We currently operate in three business segments:
•Home & Outdoor: Provides a broad range of innovative consumer products for home activities such as food preparation, cooking, cleaning, and organization; as well as products for outdoor and on the go activities such as hydration, food storage, backpacks, and travel gear. This segment sells primarily to retailers as well as through our direct-to-consumer channel.
•Health & Wellness: Provides health and wellness products including healthcare devices, thermometers, water and air filtration systems, humidifiers, and fans. Sales for the segment are primarily to retailers and distributors with some direct-to-consumer channel sales.
•Beauty: Provides mass and prestige market beauty appliances including hair styling appliances, grooming tools, decorative hair accessories, and prestige market liquid-based hair and personal care products. This segment sells primarily to retailers, beauty supply wholesalers and through our direct- to- consumer channel.
For more segment and geographic information concerning our net sales revenue, long-lived assets and operating income, refer to Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Our Strategic Initiatives
In fiscal 2015, we launched a five-year transformational strategy designed to improve the performance of our business segments and strengthen our shared service capabilities. Fiscal 2019 marked the completion of Phase I of our multi-year transformation strategy, which delivered performance across a wide range of measures. We improved organic sales growth by focusing on our Leadership Brands, made strategic acquisitions, became a more efficient operating company with strong global shared services, upgraded our organization and culture, improved inventory turns and return on invested capital, and returned capital to shareholders.
Fiscal 2020 began Phase II of our transformation, which was designed to drive the next five years of progress. The long-term objectives of Phase II include improved organic sales growth, continued margin expansion, and strategic and effective capital deployment. Phase II includes continued investment in our 
Leadership Brands, with a focus on growing them through consumer-centric innovation, expanding them more aggressively outside the U.S., and adding new brands through acquisition. We are building further shared service capability and operating efficiency, as well as focusing on attracting, retaining, unifying and training the best people. Additionally, we are continuing to enhance and consolidate our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) efforts and accelerate programs related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”) to support our Phase II transformation. See further discussion below of our initiatives in these areas. 
Consistent with our strategy of focusing resources on our Leadership Brands, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we committed to a plan to divest certain assets within our Beauty segment's mass channel personal care business, which included liquid, powder and aerosol products under brands such as Pert, Brut, Sure and Infusium (“Personal Care”). On June 7, 2021, we completed the sale of our North America Personal Care business to HRB Brands LLC, for $44.7 million in cash and recognized a gain on the sale in selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”) totaling $0.5 million. Subsequent to our fiscal 2022 year end, on March 25, 2022, we completed the sale of the Latin America and Caribbean Personal Care businesses to HRB Brands LLC, for $1.8 million in cash. The net assets sold included intangible assets, inventory, certain net trade receivables, fixed assets and certain accrued sales discounts and allowances relating to our Personal Care business. Accordingly, we continued to classify the identified net assets of the Latin America and Caribbean Personal Care businesses as held for sale in our fiscal 2022 consolidated balance sheet. 
Subsequent to our fiscal 2022 year end, on April 22, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Recipe Products Ltd., a producer of innovative prestige hair care products for all types of curly and wavy hair under the Curlsmith brand (“Curlsmith”). The total purchase consideration, net of cash acquired, was $150.0 million in cash, subject to certain customary closing adjustments. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility. 
On December 29, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Osprey, a longtime U.S. leader in technical and everyday packs, for $410.9 million in cash, net of a preliminary closing net working capital adjustment and cash acquired. Osprey is highly respected in the outdoor industry with a product lineup that includes a wide range of backpacks and daypacks for hiking, mountaineering, skiing, climbing, mountain biking, trail running, commuting, and school, as well as rugged adventure travel packs, wheeled luggage, and travel accessories. The acquisition of Osprey complements our outdoor platform, accelerates our international strategy and adds a 9th Leadership Brand to the Company.
On January 23, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Drybar Products LLC (“Drybar Products”), for approximately $255.9 million in cash. Drybar is an innovative, trend-setting prestige hair care and styling brand in the multibillion-dollar beauty industry.

For additional information see Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Our Trademarks
We market products under a number of trademarks that we own and sell certain of our products under trademarks licensed from third parties. We believe our principal trademarks, both owned and licensed, have high levels of brand name recognition among retailers and consumers throughout the world. Through our favorable partnerships with our licensors, we believe we have developed stable, enduring relationships that provide access to unique brands that complement our owned and internally developed trademarks.
The Beauty and Health & Wellness segments rely on the continued use of trademarks licensed under various agreements for a substantial portion of their net sales revenue. New product introductions under licensed trademarks require approval from the respective licensors. The licensors must also approve the product packaging. Some of our license agreements require us to pay minimum royalties.
During fiscal 2022, we sold our Pert, Sure and Infusium trademarks in connection with the sale of our North America Personal Care business. Subsequent to our fiscal 2022 year end, on March 25, 2022, we sold our Brut trademark in connection with the sale of our Latin America and Caribbean Personal Care businesses.
The following table lists our key trademarks by segment:

Segment | Owned | Licensed 
Home & Outdoor | OXO, Good Grips, Hydro Flask, Soft Works, OXO tot, OXO Brew, OXO Strive, OXO Outdoor, Osprey | 
Health & Wellness | PUR | Honeywell, Braun, Vicks
Beauty | Drybar, Hot Tools | Revlon, Bed Head 

Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We maintain utility and design patents in the U.S. and several foreign countries. We also protect certain details about our processes, products and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
Sales and Marketing
We currently market our products in over 95 countries throughout the world. Sales within the U.S. comprised approximately 78% of total net sales revenue in fiscal 2022 and 79% of total net sales revenue in both fiscal 2021 and 2020. Our segments primarily sell their products through mass merchandisers, drugstore chains, warehouse clubs, home improvement stores, grocery stores, specialty stores, beauty supply retailers, e-commerce retailers, wholesalers, and various types of distributors, as well as directly to consumers. We collaborate extensively with our retail customers and, in many instances, produce specific versions of our product lines with exclusive designs and packaging for their stores, which are appropriately priced for their respective customer bases. We market products principally through the use of outside sales representatives and our own internal sales staff, supported by our internal marketing, category management, engineering, creative services, and customer and consumer service staff. These groups work closely together to develop pricing and distribution strategies, to design packaging and to help develop product line extensions and new products.
Research and Development
Our research and development activities focus on new, differentiated and innovative products designed to drive sustained organic growth. We continually invest to strengthen our product design and research and development capabilities, including extensive studies to gain consumer insights. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and employee benefit expenses and contracted development and testing efforts associated with development of products.
Manufacturing and Distribution
We contract with unaffiliated manufacturers, primarily in China, Mexico and Vietnam, to manufacture a significant portion of our finished goods for the Home & Outdoor and Health & Wellness segments and our Beauty appliances and accessories product category. The personal and hair care category of the Beauty segment sources most of its products from U.S. manufacturers. Finished goods manufactured by vendors in Asia comprised approximately 88%, 80% and 76% of finished goods purchased for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
We occupy owned and leased office and distribution space in various locations to support our operations. These facilities include our U.S. headquarters in El Paso, Texas, and distribution centers in Southaven, Mississippi, and Olive Branch, Mississippi, which are used to support a significant portion of our domestic distribution. We are currently constructing an additional distribution facility in Gallaway, Tennessee that we expect to be operational by the end of fiscal year 2023. 
Customers
Sales to our largest customer, Amazon.com Inc., accounted for approximately 19%, 20% and 18% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales to our second largest customer, Walmart, Inc., including its worldwide affiliates, accounted for approximately 11%, 13% and 14% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales to our third largest customer, Target Corporation, accounted for approximately 11%, 11% and 9% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales revenue during these fiscal years. Sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 49%, 52% and 50% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Order Backlog
When placing orders, our individual consumer, retail and wholesale customers usually request that we ship the related products within a short time frame. As such, there usually is no significant backlog of orders in any of our distribution channels.
Seasonality
The following table illustrates the seasonality of our net sales revenue by fiscal quarter as a percentage of annual net sales revenue for the periods presented:

 | Fiscal Quarters Ended Last Day of Month
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
May | 24.3 | % | | 20.0 | % | 22.0 | %
August | 21.4 | % | | 25.3 | % | 24.2 | %
November | 28.1 | % | | 30.4 | % | 27.8 | %
February | 26.2 | % | | 24.3 | % | 26.0 | %

Our sales are seasonal due to different calendar events, holidays and seasonal weather patterns. Historically, the third fiscal quarter produces the highest net sales revenue during the fiscal year.
Competitive Conditions
We generally sell our products in markets that are very competitive and mature. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We believe that we have certain key competitive advantages, such as well recognized brands, engineering expertise and innovation, sourcing and supply chain know-how, and productive co-development relationships with our manufacturers. We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing activities, as well as an extensive sales force in order to build awareness and to encourage new consumers to try our brands and products. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We believe these advantages allow us to bring our retailers a differentiated value proposition.
The following table summarizes our primary competitors by business segment:

Segment | Competitor 
Home & Outdoor | Lifetime Brands, Inc. (KitchenAid), Newell Brands Inc., Simple Human LLC, Yeti Holdings, Inc., Bradshaw Home, Inc., Gregory Mountain Products, Mystery Ranch, CamelBak, The North Face, Deuter 
Health & Wellness | Exergen Corporation, Omron Healthcare, Inc., Crane Engineering, Newell Brands, Inc., Lasko Products, LLC, The Clorox Company (Brita), Zero Technologies, LLC, Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Dyson Ltd, Unilever (Blueair), Guardian Technologies LLC.

Environmental and Health and Safety Matters
Our operations are subject to national, state, local, and provincial jurisdictions’ environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and industry-specific product certifications. Many of the products we sell are subject to product safety laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. These laws and regulations specify the maximum allowable levels of certain materials that may be contained in our products, provide statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated products, establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain products, specify product safety testing requirements, and set product identification, labeling and claim requirements. For example, some of our Beauty segment’s customers require that our Beauty appliances comply with various safety certifications, including UL certifications. Similarly, thermometers distributed by our Health & Wellness segment must comply with various regulations governing the production and distribution of medical devices. Additionally, some product lines within our Health & Wellness segment are subject to product identification, labeling and claim requirements, which are monitored and enforced by regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
During fiscal 2022, we were in discussions with the EPA regarding the compliance of packaging claims on certain of our products in the air and water filtration categories and a limited subset of humidifier products within the Health & Wellness segment that are sold in the U.S. The EPA did not raise any product quality, safety or performance issues. As a result of these packaging compliance discussions, we voluntarily
implemented a temporary stop shipment action across this line of products in the U.S. as we worked with
the EPA towards an expedient resolution. The EPA approved modest changes to our labeling claims on packaging of the air and water filtration impacted products, which we implemented, and subsequently resumed shipping during fiscal 2022. Our consolidated and Health & Wellness segment’s net sales revenue, gross profit and operating income during fiscal 2022 was materially and adversely impacted by the stop shipment actions and the time needed to execute repackaging plans after changes were approved by the EPA. While we have resumed normalized levels of shipping of the affected inventory, we are still in process of repackaging our existing inventory of impacted products. Additionally, as a result of continuing dialogue with the EPA, we are executing further repackaging and relabeling plans on certain additional humidifier products and certain additional air filtration products. If we are not able to execute our repackaging plans on schedule to meet demand, our net sales revenue, gross profit and operating income could continue to be materially and adversely impacted. At this time, we are not aware of any fines or penalties related to this matter imposed against us by the EPA. While we do not anticipate material fines or penalties, there can be no assurances that such fines or penalties will not be imposed.
During fiscal 2022, we recorded a $13.1 million charge to cost of goods sold to write-off the obsolete packaging for the affected products in our inventory on-hand and in-transit as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022, we incurred additional compliance costs of $19.3 million, comprised of $14.6 million of incremental warehouse storage costs and legal fees, which were recognized in SG&A, and $4.7 million of storage, obsolete packaging and other charges from vendors, which were recognized in cost of goods sold. These charges are referred to throughout this Annual Report as “EPA compliance costs.” In addition, during fiscal 2022, we incurred and capitalized into 
inventory costs to repackage a portion of our existing inventory of the affected products and expect to continue to incur and capitalize such costs as we continue to repackage inventory. We also expect to incur additional compliance costs, which may include incremental freight, warehouse storage costs, charges from vendors, and legal fees, among other things. Such potential incremental EPA compliance costs will be expensed as incurred and could materially and adversely impact our consolidated and Health & Wellness segment’s gross profit and operating income. In addition, our net sales revenue could be materially and adversely impacted by customer returns, an increase in sales discounts and allowances and by the potential impact of distribution losses at certain retailers.
An emerging trend with governmental and non-governmental organizations, consumers, shareholders, retail customers, communities, and other stakeholders is increased focus and expectations on ESG matters. These trends have led to, among other things, increased public and private social accountability reporting requirements relating to labor practices, climate change, human trafficking and other ESG matters and greater demands on our packaging and products. In our product space, some requirements have already been mandated and we believe others may become required in the future. Examples of current requirements include conflict minerals content reporting, customer reporting of foreign fair labor practices in connection with our supply chain vendors, and evaluating the risks of human trafficking and slavery.
We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws, regulations and other reporting requirements. Due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of compliance and social reporting standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty what future material capital or operating expenditures, if any, will be required in order to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other reporting mandates. Further, any failure to achieve our ESG goals or a perception of our failure to act responsibly or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements relating to ESG concerns could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.
ESG Initiatives 
We seek to maintain best-in-class level of corporate governance on behalf of our stakeholders, including our associates, customers, consumers, communities, and shareholders. We also recognize the importance of environmental and social factors related to how we operate our business. We are continuing to enhance and consolidate our ESG efforts and accelerate programs related to DE&I to support our Phase II transformation.
The Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight of ESG-related matters, including climate change risks and opportunities. Our ESG Task Force, which includes associate representatives from our business segments and global shared services, leads the development and implementation of our strategic ESG plan with the goal of aligning our ESG performance with relevant standards, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) and the Task Force on Climate Finance Disclosures (“TCFD”). In June 2021, we published our first ESG Report, which aligns with relevant standards such as the SASB, the TCFD and the Global Reporting Initiative. Our ESG Report summarizes our ESG strategy and performance, including in the areas of climate change, DE&I and human capital, and environmental and natural capital management. Information in our ESG Report is not part of this Annual Report or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
We are working to implement a system to minimize negative impacts of our practices on the environment and continue to work on initiatives to reduce emissions in our supply chain and product use. As part of these efforts and in order to strengthen our support of climate action, we became a signatory of We Mean Business, a coalition of organizations and businesses with a goal of catalyzing business action to accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon economy. With our participation in this coalition, we intend to 
(1) report climate change data and measures to the Carbon Disclosure Project aligned with the guidelines of the TCFD, (2) implement a responsible climate policy, and (3) develop targets which were approved in October 2021 by the Science Based Targets initiative. 
We will also continue to advance our DE&I efforts as part of our ESG initiatives to support our focus on attracting and retaining top talent, and to help promote a work environment where everyone has the opportunity to grow to their fullest potential. We believe progress on our ESG initiatives will have a positive impact on our shareholders, consumers, customers, our talented worldwide associates and the communities in which we are proud to live and work. 
Human Capital
Overview
We are committed to fostering a positive and engaging culture of inclusion, care, and support where all people throughout our global workforce can thrive. Resources provided to enhance associates' “total well-being” include learning and development opportunities, charitable leave policy, financial advice and stock purchase programs, health and wellness programs, and product discounts. Perks and benefits vary by region and office. We also monitor our culture and associate engagement through a number of methods, including periodic culture surveys.
We have a performance evaluation and feedback program for all of our associates. We encourage career planning at all levels of the Company. We have a formal system for identifying and developing talent and growth for associates within our organization and support the creation of development and succession plans across key positions in the Company. Our senior leadership team develops and recommends to the Board of Directors succession plans for all of our senior management.
We believe our culture, fair pay, benefits, rewards and recognition, healthy-living initiatives, collaborative projects, and open communication between management and staff enables us to attract and retain talented associates. 
Our Associates
As of February 28, 2022, we employed approximately 2,146 full-time associates worldwide. We also use temporary, part-time and seasonal associates as needed.
None of our U.S. associates are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Certain of our associates in Europe and Vietnam are covered by collective arrangements or works counsel in accordance with local practice. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe that we have satisfactory working relations with our associates.
DE&I
We believe that a diverse workforce is essential to innovation, growth, and the well-being of our associates. We celebrate the diversity of our people and value the unique perspectives they bring. We are committed to cultivating an inclusive culture where all of our associates can thrive.
We are advancing short- and long-term initiatives which include: leadership coaching and training to build awareness and sponsorship, recruitment actions to increase diversity of new hires, associate learning programs to develop skills that foster inclusion, business resource groups to further support inclusion, ongoing dialogue sessions with our associates and charitable donations to non-profit organizations whose mission and values align with our culture.
Communities
We have a 50-plus-year tradition of supporting the communities where we live and work through charitable donations from both the Company and its associates. In addition, we provide our associates two paid community service days to donate their time to organizations that matter most to them. We believe our community engagement and good corporate citizenship will lead to stronger communities and shared success for our Company.
