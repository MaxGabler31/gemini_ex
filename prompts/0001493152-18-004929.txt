ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
 
The following is a summary of some of the information contained in this document. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this document to “our Company,” “us,” “we,” “our,” “Pocket Shot,” or the “Company” are to The Pocket Shot Company.
Corporate History
 
Our Company, The Pocket Shot Company, originally formed as Pocket Shot, LLC on April 9, 2003, was incorporated in the State of Colorado on December 7, 2005, and organized for the purpose of engaging in any lawful business. We are a portable spirit company, producing and distributing hard liquor in a single-shot pouch form. The flexible pouch delivery method is unique and is patented under U.S. Patent D533,462 S.
 
In 2003, our founder, Mr. Bachmann formed Pocket Shot LLC, and sought to engineer a filling machine for the flexible pouch. In 2005, Pocket Shot entered into its original filling contract with Frank-Lin and subsequently placed its filling machine at the Frank-Lin Distillery in San Jose, CA. The first production of Pocket Shots were in 2006, and the first sales occurred later that year in California. Pocket Shot sold 1,478 Cases in 2006. On January 1, 2006, we entered into a royalty agreement with Jarrold Bachmann, Founder and President of the Company, to convey Mr. Bachmann a royalty with respect to sales of the Pocket Shot Pouch. We pay a royalty of approximately $1.20 to Mr. Bachmann with respect to each case of Pocket Shot Pouches (consisting of between 60 and 120 pouches per case) sold by Pocket Shot or its licensee(s). The Pocket Shot Pouch was patented in the United States (US D533,462 S) on December 12, 2006.

In 2007, Pocket Shot was introduced in Missouri, Colorado, and Oklahoma markets. On February 28, 2008, we entered into a license agreement with Frank-Lin to manufacture and distribute Pocket Shot. From 2007-2009, Frank-Lin had a distribution agreement with Republic Distribution.
 
Since 2009, we have expanded our distribution, through Frank-Lin, to include the entire United States. Pocket Shot is currently carried in many states and countries, including Rhode Island, Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado, Arizona, New York, Indiana, Wisconsin, Texas, New Mexico, Delaware, Nevada, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Nevada, Florida, South Carolina, Missouri, Wyoming, Hawaii, Georgia, Washington, Puerto Rico, Europe, Costa Rica, and Canada.
 
Company Overview
 
Our Company is engaged in the design, production, and distribution of hard liquor and other beverages in flexible single-serving pouches. On December 12, 2006, Jarrold R. Bachmann and his assignee, Pocket Shot, LLC, received a United States Patent (US D533,462 S) for the proprietary design of a flexible fluid container. On January 1, 2006, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding Membership Units of Pocket Shot, LLC (“the LLC”) pursuant to Exchange Agreements with the Members of the LLC. We have been producing and distributing our products since 2006.
 
Jarrold Bachmann, our President, devised the idea for the product after seeing farm workers in South Africa celebrate payday with crude plastic sachets of alcohol. As an avid outdoorsman, Bachmann saw the opportunity to develop a product to fit his lifestyle and extend across all demographics from the older golfer to the extreme sport generation. “Pocket Shot” is an innovative concept that provides the consumer with “grab and go” convenient and user-friendly package for alcoholic beverages. Each Pocket Shot is packaged with a distinctive shape to resemble a miniature bottle complete with bottleneck for easy pouring.
 
We are engaged in the design, production, and distribution of hard liquor and other beverages in flexible single-serving pouches. On December 12, 2006, Pocket Shot received a United States Patent (US D533,462 S) for our proprietary design of a flexible fluid container, and has entered into a Licensing Agreement with Frank-Lin Distillers Products, Ltd., for production, filling, and distribution of hard liquor Pocket Shots, and a Licensing Agreement with PS Ventures, Inc. for Pocket Shot Energy.
 
The Pocket Shot pouch is constructed of three laminated layers of FDA approved plastic substrates produced in Switzerland, the outer of which can be screen printed with bold graphics for brand recognition.
 
Our main corporate strategy is to expand the regional distribution of Pocket Shots and to expand the product offering, including a new item called Pocket Shot Energy TM.
 
Each original Pocket Shot comes in a 50 ml single serve flexible stand-up pouch containing 80 proof varietals including:
 

● | Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey Aged Four Years

We have an exclusive licensing relationship with the alcohol manufacturer and distributor, Frank-Lin Distillers Products, Ltd. (“Frank-Lin”). Frank-Lin handles all aspects of the filling and distribution of Pocket Shot to each state where it is available for sale. Our product is shipped two ways and retailers can order Pocket Shot with a shipper display carton or a shelf hanger unit: 120 units per case – 10 sleeves, with 12 units per sleeve, or 60 units per case – five sleeves with 12 units per sleeve. Pocket Shot is available in several states and is also available through online retailers.
 
We previously signed an exclusive licensing relationship for Pocket Shot Energy, a concentrated energy beverage, with PS Ventures, Inc. PS Ventures, Inc. is not yet producing Pocket Shot Energy, but will be responsible for handling all aspects of the filling and distribution of Pocket Shot Energy to each state where it is available for sale. We do not have an anticipated launch date for Pocket Shot Energy at this time.
 
The Company is currently researching other product applications for Pocket Shot and intends to expand the variety of products available to consumers in the future.

Production and Storage
 
We are dependent upon Frank-Lin and PS Ventures, Inc., our producers/distributors, not only for sales, but also for production and distillation. As of March 2018, PS Ventures, Inc. has not produced or sold any Pocket Shot Energy due to a lack of funding. There are several steps in the production and supply process for hard alcohols. First, liquor is distilled in a multi-stage process that converts basic ingredients, including various grains and other raw materials into alcohol. Next, the alcohol is filtered for a smooth quality with minimal harshness. Achieving a high level of purity is relatively complex and involves a series of distillations and filtration processes. After the distillation is completed, Frank-Lin then fills our pre-printed pouches, made by Amcor and printed by Packaging Arts, seals and packages the product for shipment according to our specifications. Frank-Lin then stores our product in their warehouses until they have sold the product to the state distributors.
 
In June 3016, the Company purchased a Toyo rotary duplex filling machine to fill larger pouches from 296ml to 350ml. This pouch design is used for frozen alcoholic drinks such as frozen margaritas, daiquiris, and sweet teas. The machine, which is capable of filling 80 pouches per minute, has been installed in the Frank-Lin plant and equipped with the conveyors and piping for commercial filling on a toll basis for other customers of Frank-Lin. The Company is investigating development of new products in the ready to drink (“RTD”) category. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has no revenues for this line of business.
 
Sales and Customers
 
Pocket Shot only has one customer and that is Frank-Lin. Frank-Lin sets up the distributors in various states and countries and sell the product to the distributors. After all expenses we get one royalty check per month from Frank-Lin. Our royalty income in December 31, 2017 was $87,663 compared to $81,889 for 2016. With increased sales, however, the cost of sales increased in 2017 to $31,767 compared to $27,318 for 2016. The gross margin then for 2017 was $55,896 compared to $54,571 for 2016. Although sales only increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2017, we believe that our efforts to expand sales globally and offer greater product variety will help to increase sales further.
Licenses
 
On July 16, 2003, Pocket Shot, LLC received a Basic Permit to act as a wholesaler and importer of distilled spirits in the United States, from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), a division of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and Frank-Lin is also licensed by the TTB to conduct the business of a rectifier and wholesaler of alcoholic beverages in the United States.
Raw Materials
 
Our finished liquor products are shipped from Frank-Lin, who obtains all materials needed to produce our product including liquor ingredients, packaging, and other materials. We provide preprinted Pocket Shot pouches to Frank-Lin for filling, sealing, and distribution. The pouches are produced by and purchased from Amcor. Labels and packaging are produced by and purchased from Packaging Arts. Raw materials used to make our liquor products are available from a variety of suppliers. In the event Frank-Lin is unable to obtain raw materials necessary to make liquor products, we believe that alternative sources of raw materials would be available. We have not experienced any material adverse effect on our business as a result of shortages of raw materials. An unexpected interruption or a shortage in supply of raw materials, could adversely affect our business derived from these products.

Property
 
We do not currently lease or own any property at this time.
 
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) as we do not have more than $1,000,000,000 in annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as of December 31, 2017, our last fiscal year.
 
We may lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year during which (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1,000,000,000 or (ii) we issue more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt in a three-year period. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company if at any time we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement.
 
As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable to generally reporting companies. These provisions include:
 

● | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statement and only two years of related Management Discussion and Analysis Disclosures; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and 
● | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 

 
As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such sections are provided below:
 
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a public company’s auditor to attest to, and report on, management’s assessment of its internal controls.
 
Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, implemented by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation.
 
We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this registration statement, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act.

COMPETITION, MARKETS, REGULATION AND TAXATION
 
Competition
 
We believe that we compete on the basis of quality, price, ingenuity, brand recognition and distribution strength. We compete with other alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as for shelf space in retail stores. We compete with numerous local, national, multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, selling products across the United States, many of which have greater resources than us. There is no assurance we will be able to compete effectively.
Industry
 
In the 2017 year-end report of the Distilled Spirits Council (“DISCUS”) spirit consumption increased to 36.6% of the total beverage alcohol market (DISCUS 2017 Economic Briefing). The growth rate remains high for alcoholic beverages and premium categories are out-performing standard brands. The “high-end” and “super premium” categories continue to grow with rates of 7.3% and 4.9%, respectively, for volume (2017). The balance of the industries products showed an average growth rate of 2.6% for volume (2017).

-


According to the Distilled Spirits Council, the distilled spirits (a grain, fruit or vegetable based drink containing ethanol and typically over 20% alcohol by volume) sector achieved accelerated growth in 2017 with supplier sales up 4 percent to $26.2 billion, volumes up 2.6 percent to 226 million cases and an eighth straight year of market share gains relative to beer. The growth of this category, according to DISCUS Council President & CEO Kraig R. Naasz, is being “driven by consumer confidence in the U.S. economy, product innovations that adult consumers want, and a fascination with premiumization across categories.”
 
According to DISCUS, international exports of U.S. spirits also reportedly rose 14.3% over the previous year, increasing the potential market for our products. DISCUS Council Chief Economist David Ozgo noted, “Adult consumers, particularly millennials, continue to gravitate toward high-end and super premium spirits products. Companies are creating excitement in the marketplace with new products and new technologies to interact with spirits customers.”
 
We believe that brand is everything when communicating with this market. The brand essence must be related through all of the Company’s marketing efforts.
 
The spirits wholesale industry has undergone significant changes in recent years. Rapid consolidation has occurred in the supplier sector, and distributors have expanded their operations to cover a larger number of states, resulting in consolidation among distributors. Although the market is still quite fragmented in several states, only two major distributors are operating, and the trend toward consolidation in the industry is continuing.
 
Government Regulation
 
As holder of federal beverage alcohol permits, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 CFR Parts 19, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 71 and 252), U.S. Customs Laws (USC Title 19), Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Subtitles E and F), and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Laws of Pennsylvania.
 
The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the United States Treasury Department regulates the spirits industry with respect to production, blending, bottling, sales and advertising and transportation of alcohol products. Also, each state regulates the advertising, promotion, transportation, sale and distribution of alcohol products within its jurisdiction. We are also required to conduct business in the United States only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute and sell spirits.
 
Since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, Federal and State governments have regulated the sale of spirits, wine, and beer. State regulatory frameworks fall into two types: control and open (commonly referred to as licensed). In the 18 control States (Alabama, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Maryland - (Montgomery County), Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming), the State controls the distribution and/or the retail sale of alcohol beverages. In open States the distributors and retailers are privately owned businesses. In the open “franchise” States, there are laws and regulations that restrict the brand suppliers’ ability to change distributors affording distributors additional protection for their efforts.
 
Under the three-tier regulatory framework established by Federal and State law, brand suppliers of alcohol-based beverages are generally prohibited from selling their products directly to retail outlets or consumers, effectively requiring brand suppliers to utilize distributors. This regulatory framework effectively insulates distributors from vertical competition from brand suppliers or retail customers. Certain large chain retailers have challenged the three tier structure; in particular, States, in an attempt to gain favorable pricing directly from wineries and breweries. A successful challenge to the three-tier system has not occurred, but is a potential long term threat to the current framework.
 
In “Control States” the State law has historically mandated the state to act as the exclusive wholesale distributor and/or retailer of alcohol-based beverages. Brand suppliers must utilize state licensed “Brokers” to properly represent their products in the control state marketplace.
 

9
-


Given the three tier regulatory structure, the spirits distribution industry varies greatly from other industries such as food, drugs, non-alcohol-based beverages or similar products. As brand suppliers can compete directly with the distributors in these other industries by shipping directly to retailers, distributor margins tend to be much lower than those in the wine and spirits industry.
 
The advertising, marketing and sale of alcoholic beverages are subject to various restrictions in the United States. These include restrictions on the advertising style, media and messages used.
 
Specific warning statements related to risks of drinking beverage alcohol products are required to be included on all beverage alcohol products sold in the United States.
 
The distribution of alcohol-based beverages is also subject to extensive taxation both in the United States, at both the federal and state level, and internationally.
 
We are also subject to regulations which limit or preclude certain persons with criminal records from serving as our officers or directors. In addition, certain regulations prohibit parties with consumer outlet ownership from becoming officers, directors, or substantial shareholders.
 
We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable federal, state and other regulations. However, we operate in a highly regulated industry that may be subject to more stringent interpretations of existing regulations. Future costs of compliance with changes in regulations could be significant.
 
Corporate Strategy
 
MARKETING OBJECTIVE:
 Establish our brand as the premium portable spirits at the top of the category.
 
ADVERTISING OBJECTIVE:
 To create top of mind brand awareness and emotional relevance resulting in Pocket Shot being the preferred and requested product line of portable alcoholic beverage products in the industry.
SALES & MERCHANDISING OBJECTIVES:
 Our distributor will use direct selling efforts. Their efforts will be supported with our marketing, advertising, and merchandising programs. The primary task will be to increase the sales through retail channels.
 
Our corporate strategy in developing our operations and evaluating potential product streams is as follows.
 
PURSUE BRAND RECOGNITION THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES
 
The first marketing objective is to refine our brand and secure its place in the minds of the consumers. This will be accomplished through the execution of an integrated branding, identity and graphics standards programs. The deliverables for this segment will be an enhanced brand identity, a graphic standards program, brand applications and a digital assets suite.
 
We plan to spend up to $100,000 on marketing Pocket Shot in 2018, as was the plan for 2017. We did not pursue avenues for raising the funds as intended in 2017, so this is now an objective for 2018. We plan to raise these funds in Private Placements of Common Stock and/or convertible debt.
 
Pouch-style packaging is widely accepted throughout Europe and we believe that now is the best time for mass introduction in the American marketplace, as it is beginning to gain traction on a local level. Twenty-five 50ml single serving Pocket Shot pouches take up the same shelf and storage space as a similarly sized 50ml single-serving bottle.
 
Our packaging concept was first introduced in 2003 by offering the basic liquors: rum, tequila, whiskey, gin, vodka, spiced rum and brandy. The initial test marketing occurred in the United States. Our products are currently approved for distribution in 18 states with approvals pending in three more states. The company is currently negotiating for distribution rights in Australia and Mexico. The current states and countries being distributed to are Rhode Island, Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado, Arizona, New York, Indiana, Wisconsin, Texas, New Mexico, Delaware, Nevada, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Nevada, Florida, South Carolina, Missouri, Wyoming, Hawaii, Georgia, Washington, Puerto Rico, Europe, Costa Rica, and Canada.

Merchandising Strategy
 
With retail shelf space at a premium, we believe it is important to “catch the eye” of the merchandising and procurement community. This plan includes a direct sales program targeting procurement, purchasing and merchandising executives at both chain and independent beverage resellers as well as captive drug, gift and sundry shops in hotels, resorts, sports complexes and gaming establishments. The direct sales efforts will be supported with creative and powerful merchandising kits including special gift boxes which support the company’s brand and marketing theme. These boxes will contain gifts, product samples and literature designed to create a bond between the Company and the prospective client. To further enhance the sales process, the Company will offer a merchandising program including product sheets, coupons, point of sale materials (banners, shelf talkers, end cap displays and danglers), caps, tee shirts and store employee badges.
 
The Company has researched the market, the competition, and the challenges and developed its growth plans based on the following consumer benefits, distributor & retailer returns, social responsibilities, and market opportunities:
 

● | Pocket Shot products require a smaller footprint than do bottled spirits that benefits the company, the distributors, the wholesalers and the retailers 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pocket Shot packaging provides a physically and environmentally safe, break-resistant, highly-portable, convenient container for use almost anywhere. 
● | Pocket Shot products provide an incremental source of profitable business for liquor stores, sports & entertainment venues, camping & outdoor activities and much more. 
● | Pocket Shot products will provide distributors with new sales channels here-to-for inaccessible. 
● | Pocket Shot promotes anti-youth drinking campaigns and legislation that, with the Company’s aggressive marketing materials program, offers a forum for these issues, promoting abstinence and parental supervision and reinforcing that Pocket Shot is a socially responsible company. 

 
Based on the above benefit scenarios, The Company plans to seize the following opportunities:
 

● | Build superior brand recognition and become recognized as a category leader. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expand the US distribution into all states. 
● | Establish distribution in Canada. 
● | Establish and manage a knowledgeable team of account executives with industry experience. 
● | Create a retail-merchandising program that will build a strong market share. 

Marketing Strategy
 
Pocket Shot products are currently in the “novelty” stage of their growth cycle. While we have sales, they are minimal in comparison to the potential market. Research shows a void in the areas that these products will be targeting. The purpose of our marketing efforts is to move the product sales from their current position into the rapid growing “popularity” stage. Our strategy includes the following marketing programs: Branding; Merchandising; Direct; Display Advertising; Media; Public Relations; Publicity; Events; Investor Relations; Metrics Dashboard; and, Personal Sales. Our objective is to gain the sales momentum required to reach the “brand preference” stage of product growth as soon as possible. This is the stage where sales grow at a high but steady and stabilized pace. While competition is minimal, there are a few other companies seeking to gain a share of this high-potential market.
The Direct Marketing Program
 
A complete direct marketing program including direct mail, blast email and URLs will be used to introduce the products and pave the way for the sales team. We may choose to use the services of a database marketing company to leverage techniques to target prospective clients and reinforce product messages throughout the selling process. This process will commence with the modeling of our existing customer data and the analysis of the results using sophisticated analytic tools. Cross-channel marketing will be utilized in conjunction with the direct marketing including micro-blogging, social marketing and online forums. Our focus of this marketing medium will be relevance and timing, which only this medium can provide full control over and the ability to fully quantify the results.

The Media Marketing Program
 
We intend to test several media options to determine which, if any, effectively drive sales and sales leads. The mediums being consider include outdoor advertising, both static and mobile, magazine ads, and radio spots Other media to be explored are direct mail post cards and premiums such as caps and tee-shirts.
The Public Relations/Publicity Program
 
Though we have not yet, we plan to employ the services of a public relations firm to not only maintain a high corporate profile in the investment community but to keep the name and the brand at the forefront of consumers. Our PR firm will be responsible for writing and publishing press releases, coordinating event marketing and managing investor relations.
 
We place significant emphasis on advertising, marketing and promotional activities to establish and reinforce the image of the Pocket Shot brand, with the objective of building brand recognition.
 
We employ marketing, sales and customer service personnel on an as needed basis for specific events to build brand awareness. We use a range of marketing strategies and tactics to build brand equity and increase sales, including point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, in-store and on premise promotions, public relations, and a variety of other traditional and non-traditional marketing techniques to support the sales of all of our products.
 
We place a significant emphasis on our design, labeling and packaging to establish and reinforce the image of our brand name. For instance, our Pocket Shots are colorful and translucent, so as to see the various types of liquor contained therein. The individual Pocket Shots and packaging are also branded and cross promoted with the specialty liquors that are used from time to time. In our current product lineup, Pocket Shot is offering two of Frank-Lin’s 8 Seconds Cinnamon Whiskey and Defrost Peppermint Schnapps.
 
We believe that a marketing mix of event promotions, social media, print advertising in local media and internet advertising providing information and samples of our products at social events is a strategy that may help increase sales.

We plan to profile our existing customers and create a sophisticated data model to mathematically and statistically identify The Company’s “ideal” customer. Further the model will be used to learn exactly how the target customer wishes to be communicated with and marketed to.
The International Market
 
We plan to market our product internationally. Many of the current products offered by us already receive a strong reception by the international community. A report issued by the industry association, published in February 2018, indicated a strong international marketing potential for the company (DISCUS Feb 1, 2018). This will be a secondary but strong focus by the Company’s marketing team.
Achieve Consistent Sales Growth
 
We aspire to achieve consistent growth over the next four years through a combination of marketing and product expansion. Our target consumers will be all adults of legal drinking age and we will specifically look to attract adults leading an active, adventurous lifestyle.

Experienced Management
 
Our senior management team has over 30 years of experience in the various consumer product industries, and has a proven track record of creating value both organically and through strategic acquisitions. Our management intends to utilize the best available and fit-for-purpose technology and experienced contractors to improve production and expand distribution.
The Operations
 
We currently sub-contract all of our manufacturing, distilling, packaging and distributions. We own the primary filling and packing equipment that is operated by our sub-contractor, Frank-Lin. Our long-term plan includes the funds and staffing necessary to bring these operations in-house as soon as possible. We hope to begin staffing, equipping and preparing the in-house filling of pouches, packing and fulfillment within the next two to three years.
Proposed Legislation.
 
A number of legislative proposals may be or have been introduced in Congress and in the legislatures of various states, which, if enacted, would significantly affect the liquor industries. Such proposals and executive actions involve, among other things, the imposition of more liquor controls. At present, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, will actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals will have.
