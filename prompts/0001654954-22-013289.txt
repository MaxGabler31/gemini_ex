Item 1. Business
Overview

Visium Technologies, Inc. (“Visium”) was incorporated in Nevada as Jaguar Investments, Inc. during October 1987. During March 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company merged with Freight Rate, Inc., a development stage company in the logistics software business. During May 2003, the Company changed its name to Power2Ship, Inc. During October 2006, the Company merged with a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, Fittipaldi Logistics, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with the Company surviving but its name changed to Fittipaldi Logistics, Inc. effective November 2006. During December 2007, the Company merged with a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, NuState Energy Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with the Company surviving but renamed NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. effective December 2007. In March 2018, the Company brought in a new management team and changed its name to Visium Technologies, Inc.

Visium is a provider of cyber security visualization, big data analytics and automation that operates in the traditional cyber security space, as well as in the Internet of Things and data analytics spaces.  In March 2019, Visium entered into a software license agreement with MITRE Corporation to license a patented technology known as CyGraph, a tool for cyber warfare analytics, visualization and knowledge management. CyGraph is a military-grade, highly scalable big data analytics tool for cyber security, based on graph database technology. The development of the technology was sponsored by the US Army and is currently in use by the U.S. Army Cyber Command. CyGraph provides advanced analytics for cybersecurity situational awareness that is scalable, flexible and comprehensive. Visium has completed significant proprietary product development efforts to commercialize CyGraph, which the Company has rebranded as TruContextTM. The commercialization efforts included adding functionality to the core technology to make it a native cloud application, adding multi-user and multi-tenant capability, enhancing the graphical user interface, (“GUI”) to make the application more intuitive to use, and adding enhanced dashboard and reporting capabilities. TruContext would typically be deployed by an enterprise and be used by the security analyst to intuitively understand the massive amount of data flowing through the network environment, giving the analyst actionable information in real-time to ensure that the network is protected from threats.  The analyst will understand the relationships of the assets in the data center, the communication patterns, and cybersecurity exposures, in real-time.

TruContext provides visualization, advanced cyber monitoring intelligence, threat hunting, forensic and root cause analysis, data modeling, analytics, and automation to help reduce risk, simplify security, and deliver better security outcomes.  Our mission is to help people see and understand data, empowering decision-makers to make more informed and more timely decisions.  Our solutions put the power of data into the hands of everyday people, allowing a broad population of business users to engage with their data, ask questions, solve problems, and create value.

Our products dramatically reduce the complexity, and expense associated with traditional business intelligence applications. Our software allows people to access information, perform analysis, and share results without assistance from technical specialists. By putting powerful analytical technology directly into the hands of people who make decisions with data, we accelerate the pace of informed and intelligent decision-making. Our TruContext platform enables our customers to reduce or streamline their siloed and layered security products, simplifying operations while providing a comprehensive solution.  Our solution automates certain previously manual tasks, freeing up personnel to focus on their most important objectives.

TruContext can be deployed in a broad range of use cases such as cyber security threat intelligence and forensics, IT/OT critical infrastructure security, supply chain analytics, anti-fraud, law enforcement, compliance, and health care.  For example, a breach of your network might go undetected for months, as was the case with the Solar Winds hack that occurred in 2019-2020. In that case the hackers went undetected for 14 months.  A Solar Winds type breach may not be preventable, but with TruContext analyzing streaming network data in real-time, this hack would almost certainly have been identified and remediated very quickly.

TruContext is a very effective tool for proactively and iteratively searching through networks to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions.  Should a breach occur, TruContext can quickly perform forensics and root cause analysis, identifying when an incident occurred, how it occurred, and the downstream effects of the incident to the network.

One of the top challenges faced by Security practitioners is to keep up with the increase in new cyber attacks while investigating and remediating existing threats. Time is of the essence while investigating potential threats and determining the scope and root-cause of a potential reach. 

Shortage of resources and experienced personnel continues to limit the ability of companies to conduct thorough investigations.  Root cause analysis and forensics are key to intelligently securing the network.

TruContext directly addresses these challenges by:

Providing real-time comprehensive visualized information on security events, that


· | allow the cyber warrior to immediately pinpoint the root cause of the breach; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | know with certainty the priority and required remediation. 


The real-time ingestion of and visualization of massive amounts of data simplifies the cyber effort, allowing the cyber analyst to intuitively understand the security posture of the organization at a glance.

Using TruContext makes the cyber analyst significantly more productive by eliminating false positives and prioritizing threat events.  

TruContext ingests cyber data from any source, making the data generated by other cyber tools easily understood and actionable.  TruContext give the security analyst the ability to combine, layer, filter, and query data with a no-code user interface in a way that no other analytics platform can do.

There are some sophisticated and powerful cybersecurity tools currently available, but they all lack one thing – providing a comprehensive contextualized understanding of the data.  Analysts have too many tools that don’t communicate, creating silos of data/information.  TruContext brings all the information for a comprehensive visualization.

On average, according to CrowdStrike, the time from breach to harm caused by threat actors is 98 minutes making the ability to:


1. | Identify malicious hacks in real time; and 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Perform threat hunting critically important for the security analyst


Using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, TruContext can hunt threats beyond the physical network boundary so that the analyst fully understands his security posture in real time.

TruContext leverages MITRE’s ATT&CK® framework, which is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

 A use case example for TruContext would be in the event sensitive data is being exfiltrated from your network to an external IP address. TruContext has the capability to identify this activity and provide alerts that would allow the cyber analyst to quickly remediate the problem. 

Another example for TruContext would be the analysis of millions of unemployment insurance claims by a state government that identifies patterns to identify potential fraud. If 30 claims are submitted that are tied to a single bank account, or address, or social security number, TruContext would be able to identify these anomalies in real-time. TruContext offers new methods of uncovering fraud rings and other complex scams with a high level of accuracy through advanced contextual link analysis, and is capable of stopping advanced fraud scenarios in real time. This is currently a significant problem in every state, costing billions of dollars annually. 

One last example of how TruContext can be used by law enforcement in the context of police investigations. TruContext can analyze highly connected data in real time from any source and make connections which help police solve crime. Connections are quickly made between persons, objects, locations, and events (the POLE model), generating insights into patterns of behaviors and incidents. Using real-time data with TruContext helps investigators be proactive and prevent crime or other incidents, rather than only reacting after an incident has occurred. 

Visium currently plans to generate revenue in three (3) primary ways: 

●    through a virtual appliance model, primarily targeted to the Federal government, charging an annual seat license, with the seat license fee increasing based on the size of the network environment ; 
●    through a SaaS model, charging a recurring monthly license fee for TruContext based on the size of the network environment and the number of TruContext Identifiers (nodes); and 
●    through professional services to support and deliver cybersecurity solutions and services to its customers, billed on an hourly basis, and delivered through a service contract for implementation and data science services. 

Partnership Ecosystem 

We work with a number of technology alliance partners to design go-to-market strategies that combine our platform with products or services provided by our technology alliance partners. These partner integrations deliver more secure solutions and an improved end user experience to their customers. Our technology alliance partnerships focus on security analytics, network and infrastructure security, threat platforms and orchestration, and automation. 

Visium heavily relies on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers. For example, we host many of our products using third-party data center facilities, and we do not control the operation of these facilities. In addition, we rely on certain technology that we license from third parties, including third-party commercial software and open-source software, which is used with certain of our solutions. 

Competition 

The markets for our solutions are highly competitive, and we expect both the requirements and pricing competition to increase, particularly given the increasingly sophisticated attacks, changing customer preferences and requirements, current economic pressures, and market consolidation. Competitive pressures in these markets may result in price reductions, reduced margins, loss of market share and inability to gain market share, and a decline in sales, any one of which could seriously impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We may face competition due to changes in the manner that organizations utilize IT assets and the security solutions applied to them, such as the provision of privileged account security functionalities as part of public cloud providers’ infrastructure offerings, or cloud-based identity management solutions. Limited IT budgets may also result in competition with providers of other advanced threat protection solutions such as McAfee, LLC, Palo Alto Networks, Splunk Inc., and Dynatrace. We also may compete, to a certain extent, with vendors that offer products or services in adjacent or complementary markets to privileged access management, including identity management vendors and cloud platform providers such as Okta and Tableau.
