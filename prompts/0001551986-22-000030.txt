Overview
9 Meters is a clinical-stage company pioneering novel treatments for people with rare digestive diseases, gastrointestinal (“GI”) conditions with unmet needs, and debilitating disorders in which the biology of the gut is a contributing factor. Our pipeline includes drug candidates for short bowel syndrome (“SBS”), celiac disease (“CeD”), multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (“MIS-C”) and a robust pipeline of early-stage candidates for undisclosed rare diseases and/or unmet needs. 
In April 2020, we completed a merger (the “RDD Merger”) with privately-held RDD Pharma, Ltd., an Israel corporation (“RDD”) and subsequently changed our name from Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. to 9 Meters Biopharma, Inc. Shortly thereafter, we acquired Naia Rare Diseases, Inc. and completed the integration of all three entities during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Our current product development pipeline is described in the table below. 
Figure 1: Current product development pipeline
Corporate Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on rare or debilitating digestive diseases that has the potential to transform current treatment paradigms for patients and address unmet medical needs. The critical components of our strategy are as follows:
•Advance the development of vurolenatide (NM-002) for the treatment of SBS. We completed the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for the treatment of SBS. We announced positive topline results in December 2020, indicating that NM-002 met its primary objective, demonstrating excellent safety and tolerability. In addition, NM-002 demonstrated a clinically relevant improvement in total stool output (“TSO”) volume within 48 hours of the first dose. We launched a multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled randomized Phase 2 trial in SBS in the second quarter of 2021, which, to our knowledge, is the largest placebo controlled Phase 2 trial in SBS. We expect topline results in the second quarter of 2022.
•Complete the Phase 3 clinical trial for larazotide (NM-001) for celiac disease. We initiated the Phase 3 trial for larazotide for treatment of celiac disease during 2019. We have three treatment groups, 0.25 mg of larazotide, 0.5 
mg of larazotide and a placebo arm (total n=525) being conducted at over 100 clinical trial sites. Site activation and patient enrollment have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the evolving situation with COVID-19, which could continue to directly or indirectly impact the pace of enrollment. The interim analysis is expected in June 2022. 
•Advance our early-stage drug product candidates for undisclosed rare and unmet needs. We initiated IND-enabling activities for NM-102, our proprietary tight-junction microbiome regulator during 2021. NM-003, our long-acting GLP-2 agonist, is currently undergoing a preclinical proof-of-concept study. Also during 2021, we acquired a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting circulating glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), referred to as NM-136. We expect to progress at least one of these early-stage drug candidates to an IND in 2022.
•Acquire targeted clinical compounds for rare or debilitating digestive diseases with unmet needs. We continually evaluate in-licensing opportunities and may acquire targeted clinical compounds for rare or debilitating digestive diseases. Focusing on rare or debilitating digestive diseases with unmet needs within GI allows for a targeted corporate development approach. 
•Pursue a capital efficient commercialization strategy. For products with rare and/or orphan patient populations, our plan is to build an infrastructure to commercialize our drug products within the U.S. Drawing upon our expertise in both rare and digestive diseases, we aim to build a specialized yet efficient infrastructure that will support the entire commercialization continuum, including stakeholder education, treatment decision, and initiation and product access throughout the patient journey. In addition, we plan to seek partners to commercialize our drug products outside of the U.S. For large addressable markets, such as celiac disease, we plan to seek global partners with an established presence and history of successful commercialization. 
•Leverage, protect and enhance our intellectual property portfolio and secure patents for additional indications. We intend to continue to expand our intellectual property, grounded in securing composition of matter patents and method of use patents for new indications. We plan to develop new formulations for our current product candidates for other indications and improve performance of existing product candidates. We plan to enhance the intellectual property portfolio further through learnings from ongoing clinical trials and manufacturing processes.
•Outsource capital intensive operations. We plan to continue to outsource capital intensive operations, including most clinical development and all manufacturing operations of our product candidates and to facilitate the rapid development of our pipeline by using high quality specialist vendors and consultants in a capital efficient manner.

Vurolenatide for the Treatment of Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS)
Short Bowel Syndrome Background
SBS is a debilitating orphan disease resulting from the physical or functional loss of the colon or small intestine. These functional and physical losses result from intestinal resection due to recurrent Crohn’s disease, vascular events, trauma, malignancy, and complications from abdominal surgery. Such resections hinder absorption of water, vitamins, protein, fat, calories and other nutrients from food, resulting in diarrhea, dehydration and malnutrition. In addition, some patients have a life-long dependency on Parenteral Support (“PS”), which is the intravenous delivery of nutrition and fluids through a central line catheter. PS support is costly, burdensome, and associated with a myriad of complications. (Jeppesen 2014). A review of literature found that the mortality rate of adult patients with SBS ranges from 15-47% depending on age and length of parenteral nutrition (Schalamon 2003). Furthermore, a study that we commissioned found that SBS patients have a diminished quality of life due to urgent and frequent bowel movements at all times of the day, chronic diarrhea, weakness, exhaustion from dehydration, poor sleep quality, and mental anguish due to the impact of symptoms on their ability to live a normal life. 
Figure 3: Short bowel syndrome disease profile 
Teduglutide is a treatment that is approved for patients with SBS.  Marketed as Gattex® in the United States and Revestive® in Europe, it is approved for the treatment of SBS patients 1 year and older who are dependent on PS.  Teduglutide is an analog of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), a hormone secreted postprandially by L-cells in sections of the bowel that are frequently removed in patients with SBS.  GLP-2 is involved in regulating normal nutrient and energy absorption in the intestine. While teduglutide has demonstrated clinical benefits, it requires daily injections and a multi-step reconstitution process. In addition, teduglutide’s patient population is constrained to patients who are dependent on PS and excludes PS patients with GI malignancies. Furthermore, a review of teduglutide US insurance claims across a 24-month period revealed a significant decline in persistency; 25% of patients discontinued therapy by month three, 38% discontinued by month six, 52% discontinued by month twelve and 66% by month twenty-four.  (VectivBio Corporate Presentation). 
Market Opportunity for SBS
The true incidence and prevalence of SBS are unknown because no reliable patient database exists. However, review of epidemiology from several sources indicates that there are an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 SBS patients in the United States and an additional 11,000 total patients in the EU4, United Kingdom and Canada. Furthermore, we believe that there is a significant patient opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, and Latin America (Jeppesen 2013, Global Data, Charles River Associates).
Despite the limitations of teduglutide, Takeda reported global sales of 641 million U.S. Dollars in 2020. Takeda reported net sales of 492 million U.S. Dollars through the third quarter of 2021, which annualized is projected to be approximately 656 million U.S. Dollars. We believe that the SBS patient population utilizing teduglutide is a fraction of the total addressable SBS patient population. Accordingly, we believe that there is additional addressable global market opportunity for alternative therapeutic options that offer potential for improved dosing and administration, a faster onset of action, and an improved safety and tolerability profile. 
Vurolenatide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (“GLP-1”) receptor agonist that combines exenatide with a proprietary extended half-life technology for treatment of SBS. The long-acting linker technology is designed specifically to address the gastric effects in SBS patients by slowing digestive transit time. Vurolenatide uses proprietary XTEN® technology to extend the half-life of exenatide, allowing for potentially weekly to every other week dosing, which could increase convenience for patients and caregivers. 
Vurolenatide has demonstrated efficacy and an extended half-life up to 30 days in a 70-patient clinical study and received orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. We completed our Phase 1b/2a study in adult patients suffering from SBS in December 2020, with the goal of demonstrating excellent safety and tolerability. 
Figure 4: Vurolenatide Mechanism of Action
Figure 5: Potential Advantages of Vurolenatide 
On December 7, 2020, we announced positive topline results from our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for vurolenatide in SBS. The study met its primary objective as vurolenatide demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability. In addition, vurolenatide demonstrated a clinically relevant improvement in total stool output (TSO) volume within 48 hours of first dose. 
The Phase 1b/2a clinical trial was an open-label, two-dose study evaluating the safety and tolerability of three escalating fixed doses of vurolenatide (50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg) in nine adults with SBS for 56 days. The trial was conducted at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Patients in each of three cohorts received two subcutaneous doses two weeks apart with six weeks of subsequent follow-up. The study assessed the safety and tolerability of repeated doses on Days 1 and 15 at each dose level. Because reduced TSO volume and bowel movement frequency are correlated with improved intestinal absorption and potentially less need for intravenous supplementation for nutrition and hydration, these were key secondary objectives in the trial. The primary purpose of this open-label Phase 1b/2a study was to learn about the compound and its safety and potential efficacy to inform future development. The study protocol called for an analysis of urine output, however, it proved difficult to measure in an ambulatory setting and therefore the analysis is not expected to be meaningful.
Vurolenatide was generally safe and well tolerated: 17 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were observed in nine patients, 15 of which were mild, transient and self-limited without further intervention. The majority of TEAEs were GI-related (nausea and vomiting).
Importantly, eight of the nine patients experienced meaningful declines in TSO following each dose, relative to a baseline output. The rapid onset of clinical improvements in stool volumes, as observed in all nine patients having substantial reductions in stool output within 48 hours of the first dose, shows the potential for vurolenatide to address the primary problem of chronic malabsorptive diarrhea in SBS patients. Additionally, four of seven patients showed reductions in bowel movement frequency after one dose and five of six evaluable patients showed reductions in bowel movement frequency after the second dose. Furthermore, of the five patients on parenteral support in the study, two patients showed reduction in PS after each dose. Results of the short form health survey quality of life instrument show directional improvement in multiple elements of health status over the course of the study. The short form health survey, or SF-36, is a set of generic, coherent and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting and are now widely utilized by managed care organizations and by Medicare for routine monitoring and assessment of care outcomes in adult patients. 
Figure 6: NM-002 Phase 1b/2a trial results 
Following FDA communication in the first quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 study of vurolenatide for the treatment of SBS in the second quarter of 2021 with a target of recruiting approximately 22 patients using TSO as the primary efficacy outcome measure. This trial is a multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The FDA has provided global anchor questions and specific guidance for performance of exit interviews to support clinical meaningfulness of observed efficacy. 
Figure 7: FDA Response on Planned Phase 2 program
We anticipate topline results from our Phase 2 study in the second quarter of 2022. Following Phase 2 results and an End-of-Phase 2 meeting, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2022. 
Larazotide for Celiac Disease (CeD)
Celiac Disease

CeD is a genetically linked, auto-immune mediated gastrointestinal disease that manifests as a life-long sensitivity to dietary gluten. Classical symptoms include abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and fatigue. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that permeability of the small intestine increases in CeD. This increased permeability potentiates the entrance of gliadin, a protein found in gluten, into the lamina propria, or mucosal membrane of the small intestine, through disassembly of the tight junction, a cell adhesion complex that regulates the leakage of solutes and water and seals the paracellular pathway of the small intestine. This cascade triggers an immune response and further disassembly of the tight junction (Khalegi 2016). CeD is characterized by chronic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa that may result in diverse symptoms, malabsorption, atrophy of intestinal villi, and a variety of clinical manifestations. Inadequately managed CeD can lead to complications including malnutrition, osteoporosis, neurologic conditions, lymphoma, and gastric cancers (Kurien 2016). 
There is a strong genetic predisposition to CeD, with major risk associated with HLA DQ2 (approximately 95% of CeD patients) and HLA-DQ8 (approximately 5% of CeD patients) (Withoff 2016). In genetically predisposed individuals, the recognition of gliadin peptides by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 and DQ8 T cells may be responsible for initiating the cascade of adaptive and innate autoimmune reactions responsible for mucosal destruction. The adaptive response is mediated by gluten-reactive CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria that recognize gluten-derived peptides. The CD4+ T cells then produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma. This results in an inflammatory cascade with the release of cytokines, anti-tTG antibodies, T cells, and other tissue-damaging mediators leading to villous injury and crypt hyperplasia in the intestine. Anti-human tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies are also produced, which form the basis of serological diagnosis of CeD.
The current approach for diagnosis of CeD is to use anti-tissue transglutaminase-2 (tTG-2) antibody tests as an initial screen with definitive diagnosis from biopsy of the small intestine mucosa. The diagnosis of CeD is confirmed by demonstration of characteristic histologic changes in the small intestinal mucosa, which are scored based on criteria initially put forth by Marsh and later modified. In 2012, the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Guidelines allowed symptomatic children with serum anti-tTG antibody levels ≥10 times upper limit of normal to avoid duodenal biopsies after positive human leukocyte (HLA) test and serum anti-endomysial antibodies.

The need for multiple clinical and laboratory findings to diagnose CeD makes monitoring disease progression difficult. International guidelines have standardized definitions and criteria for the diagnosis of CeD, though there is less clear guidance for follow-up and monitoring. After initial diagnosis, the American College of Gastroenterology recommends annual follow-up performed by a healthcare provider with knowledge of CeD. Recommendations for monitoring disease progression may include assessing symptoms, dietary compliance, and repeating serology tests. 
The global prevalence of CeD is estimated to be 1% of the population worldwide and growing, equating to approximately 3.2 million patients in the United States and approximately 3.5 million patients in the EU4, United Kingdom, and Northern Europe. The diagnostic journey is long and frustrating, with many patients waiting 6 to 10 years between the appearance of initial symptoms and diagnosis (beyondceliac.org). Furthermore, one study of U.S. claims found that patients with CeD incur greater healthcare costs versus controls (Capell).
Patients with CeD have no treatment alternative other than a strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet, which is difficult to maintain and can be deficient in key nutrients. As of August 5, 2014, all manufacturers of FDA-regulated packaged food making a gluten-free claim must comply with the guidelines outlined by the FDA (www.fda.gov/gluten-freelabeling). A “gluten-free” claim still allows up to 20 ppm of gluten which is more than 100mg/day and up to 500 mg/day of gluten exposure. Due to the presence of gluten in foods, beer, liquor, cosmetics and household products, exposure is difficult to completely avoid and due to cross-contamination, CeD patients have increased risks of exposure to gluten, which can cause symptoms more frequently. Multiple studies have shown that even those patients on a gluten-free diet suffer from symptoms, often consume gluten inadvertently, and have evidence of intestinal damage (Silvester 2020, Leffler 2015, Hall 2013).
CeD patients are often categorized in three distinct groups: responsive to a gluten-free diet, non-responsive to a gluten-free diet, and refractory CeD. Non-responsive CeD is defined as continued symptoms, elevated serum antibodies, or villous 
atrophy that persists despite following a gluten-free diet for six months or longer. Refractory CeD is defined as recurrent or persistent malabsorptive symptoms and villous atrophy despite strictly following a gluten-free diet for 12 months or longer. Non-responsive CeD is estimated to occur in 20-30% of CeD patients. Refractory CeD is estimated to occur in 1-2% of patients and is classified as a rare disease by the National Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD) (rarediseases.org). A study that we commissioned found that CeD patients suffer both physical and emotional pain, with constant bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue and persistent anxiety stemming from a fear of gluten cross-contamination. 

Larazotide
Larazotide is being developed for the treatment of CeD and has successfully completed a Phase 2b trial showing statistically significant reduction in abdominal and non-GI (headache) symptoms. Larazotide is an 8-amino acid peptide formulated into an orally administered capsule and has been tested in nearly 600 CeD patients with statistically significant improvement in CeD symptoms. The FDA has granted larazotide Fast Track Designation for CeD. Larazotide’s safety profile has been similar to placebo. In addition, the FDA granted a thorough QT (TQT) study waiver. The waiver supports larazotide’s strong precedent of safety and could potentially streamline the program’s timeline and cost effectiveness. Additionally, larazotide’s mechanism of action as a tight junction regulator is a new approach to treating autoimmune diseases, such as CeD. Multiple pre-clinical studies have shown larazotide causes a reduction in permeability across the intestinal epithelial barrier, making it the only drug candidate known to us which is in clinical trials with this mechanism of action. 
With the release of the Phase 2b trial data in 342 CeD patients at the 2014 Digestive Disease Week conference, larazotide became the first and the only drug for the treatment of CeD (published data), which met its primary efficacy endpoint with statistical significance. The Phase 2b data showed statistically significant (p=0.022) reduction in abdominal and non-GI (headache) symptoms as measured by the patient reported outcome primary end point for CeD created specifically for CeD and wholly owned by us (“CeD PRO”). We completed the End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, which confirmed the regulatory path forward and we launched the Phase 3 registration program in 2019. 
Figure 8: Responder Rate Analysis: Larazotide is the only drug in development for celiac disease to meet its primary endpoint with statistical significance (shown above) as measured by CeD GSRS and the copyrighted CeD PRO. Source: Gastroenterology 2015; 148:1311–1319; p. 1315
Larazotide is an orally administered, locally acting, non-systemic, synthetic 8-amino acid, tight junction regulator being investigated as an adjunct to a gluten-free diet in CeD patients who still experience persistent GI symptoms despite being on a 
gluten-free diet. Because of larazotide’s lack of absorption into the blood circulation, we believe that fewer complications, if any, are likely to develop for individuals taking chronically dosed lifetime medication.

The larazotide drug product is an enteric coated drug product formulated as enteric coated multiparticulate beads filled into hard gelatin capsules for oral delivery. The enteric coating is designed to allow the bead particles to bypass the stomach and release larazotide upon entry into the small intestine (duodenum). A mixed bead formulation is used to allow partial release of larazotide upon entry into the duodenum and to release the remaining larazotide approximately 30 minutes later. In clinical trials, larazotide has been dosed 15 minutes before meals allowing time for its effect in the small bowel before exposure to gluten.
 
In research studies supportive of the mechanism of action, larazotide has been shown to stimulate recovery of mucosal barrier function via the regulation of tight junctions both in vitro and in vivo, including in a CeD mouse model (Gopalakrishnan, 2012). In doing so, it is proposed that larazotide reduces the symptoms associated with CeD. Larazotide regulates tight junction opening triggered by both gluten and inflammatory cytokines, thus reducing uptake of gluten. Larazotide also disrupts the intestinal permeability-inflammation loop and has been shown to reduce symptoms associated with CeD. 

Figure 9: Larazotide intestinal barrier response
Larazotide’s Dose Response 

In several clinical trials, larazotide has exhibited clinical benefit by reducing CeD symptoms at lower doses while inhibition of this activity occurs at the higher doses. To better understand this observation, the pharmacology of larazotide was evaluated in an ex vivo porcine model. The study revealed that a specific aminopeptidase located within the brush borders of the intestinal epithelium cleaves larazotide into two fragments. These cleaved fragments do not decrease intestinal permeability. Moreover, when these two fragments are administered in combination with the active full-length larazotide, they inhibit larazotide’s activity to restore intestinal wall integrity or reduce permeability. These data demonstrate that higher doses of larazotide lead to production of breakdown fragments, which then compete with and block activity of larazotide after a threshold concentration is reached. These data also provide the scientific basis for the observation of clinical efficacy at a lower dose of larazotide (i.e., a dose when competing inactive fragments are absent or at a low concentration).

Figure 10: An aminopeptidase in the brush border cleaves larazotide into two fragments: fragment 2 acts as an inhibitor of larazotide
Summary of Key Clinical Trials using Larazotide in Celiac Disease

Larazotide has been administered to humans in seven clinical trials. These include three Phase 1 trials: two trials in healthy participants and a Phase 1b proof of concept trial in participants with CeD, and two Phase 2 gluten challenge studies in participants with controlled CeD. Additionally, larazotide was tested in two Phase 2 trials in participants with active CeD (Figure 11). After exposure in more than 600 participants, the safety profile of larazotide remained similar to placebo due to its lack of absorption into the bloodstream, which we believe is an important advantage for a chronically dosed drug.

The initial Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for the treatment of CeD was filed with the FDA by Alba Therapeutics Corporation (“Alba”) on 12 August 2005 for the use of larazotide acetate (NM-001). The IND was transferred from Alba to Innovate effective March 8, 2016. During the seven clinical studies, 5 patients experienced a serious adverse event, of which 2 received placebo and 3 received larazotide. These events included inflammation of the gallbladder, gall stones, depression, allergic reaction to penicillin, and appendicitis. We do not believe that any of these events were considered related to treatment with study medication.

Clinical Trial (-006) Results Revealed Key Insight into Symptom Reduction as a Primary Endpoint

A Phase 2b study with a gluten challenge (CLIN1001-006) was conducted in 184 participants with well-controlled CeD on a gluten-free diet. Participants were randomized to one of four treatment groups, (placebo, 1 mg, 4 mg, or 8 mg larazotide) and asked to take treatment 15 minutes prior to each meal (TID). Participants remained on their gluten-free diets throughout the duration of the trial except for 900 mg of gluten that was taken with each meal. The trial results revealed key insights into how to move the program forward by focusing on reduction of symptoms. The 1-mg dose prevented the development of gluten-induced symptoms as measured by CeD GSRS (a patient-reported outcome (PRO) devised and validated by AstraZeneca) and all drug treatment groups had lower anti-transglutaminase antibody levels than the placebo group. Results of pre-specified secondary endpoints suggest that larazotide reduced antigen exposure as manifested by reduced production of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) levels and immune reactivity towards gluten and gluten-related GI symptoms in participants with CeD undergoing a gluten challenge.
Clinical Trial (-012) Met the Primary Endpoint with Statistical Significance (CeD GSRS)

The purpose of the -012 study was to assess the efficacy (reduction and relief of signs and symptoms of CeD) of 3 different doses of larazotide (0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg TID) versus placebo for the treatment of CeD in adults as an adjunct to a gluten-free diet. Larazotide or placebo was administered TID, 15 minutes prior to each meal. After a screening period, subjects were asked to continue following their current gluten-free diets into a placebo run-in phase for 4 weeks after which they were randomized to drug versus placebo. Subjects maintained an electronic diary capturing daily symptoms (“CeD-PRO”), weekly symptoms (“CeD GSRS”), bowel movements (“BSFS”), and a self-reported daily general well-being assessment.
The primary endpoint of average on-treatment CeD GSRS score throughout the treatment period was met at the 0.5 mg TID dose. In addition, a number of pre-specified secondary and exploratory endpoints, such as symptomatic days and symptom-free days, collectively demonstrated that a dose of 0.5 mg TID was superior to placebo and higher doses of larazotide. No difference was observed between the two higher dose levels (1 mg and 2 mg TID) or placebo, suggesting a narrow dose range around the 0.5 mg dose, which also seems to correlate with pre-clinical data.

The CeD PRO showed a treatment effect of 14.3% (drug responder rate minus placebo responder rate). Although to our knowledge there are no celiac drugs approved as a comparator, the treatment effect was greater than several other GI drugs approved for irritable bowel syndrome (“IBS”) and chronic idiopathic constipation (“CIC”) which use a similar clinical trial design.
Figure 12: Phase 3 trial design for the treatment of celiac disease
The Phase 3 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of larazotide acetate for the relief of persistent symptoms in patients with CeD on a gluten-free diet. The trial consists of a screening/eligibility period, a 12-week double-blind treatment phase and a 12-week double-blind safety phase. The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline to the 12-week double-blind treatment phase in CeD-PRO Abdominal Domain scores. Key inclusion criteria include adult patients diagnosed with CeD (positive celiac serology plus consistent biopsy histology) for at least 6 months, on a gluten-free diet for at least 6 months, experiencing symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, abdominal cramping, bloating, gas, diarrhea, loose stools or nausea), and those willing to maintain current gluten-free diet throughout the participation of the study. Patients screened with refractory celiac or severe complications of celiac disease and/or chronic active GI disease other than CeD are excluded from the study.
Figure 13: Larazotide Target Product Profile
We have over 100 active clinical trial sites in our Phase 3 trial with three treatment groups, 0.25 mg of larazotide, 0.5 mg of larazotide and a placebo arm. Site activation and patient enrollment have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the evolving situation with COVID-19, which is likely to directly or indirectly impact the pace of enrollment over the next several months. In addition, after consultation with the FDA, the analytical approach to the primary endpoint was modified to perform a continuous variable analysis instead of a responder analysis of the primary efficacy outcome. The revised methodology enabled a more capital-efficient study, with reduction in participants from 630 to 525. We expect the interim analysis in June of 2022. The interim analysis will perform a sample size re-estimation that will preserve statistical alpha. During 2021, we engaged Beyond Celiac and The Celiac Disease Foundation to further identify potential and appropriate patients for enrollment in the Phase 3 trial. Additionally, we implemented multiple social media initiatives to potentially enhance enrollment. 
CeD PRO: Copyrighted Primary Endpoint for Celiac Disease Tested in a Successful Clinical Trial

The CeD PRO was developed based on FDA guidance and is copyrighted in the United States effective October 13, 2011. The copyright registration is in effect for 95 years from the year of first publication or 120 years from the year of creation, whichever expires first. If larazotide is approved by the FDA and is the first drug to be approved for CeD, we believe that the PRO will become the standard for assessing efficacy in CeD. Competitor companies seeking to use a PRO to establish efficacy in this indication would either need to develop their own PRO or would be required to license the CeD PRO from us. 
Expanded Access Program
In January 2021, we instituted an Expanded Access Program for Larazotide. Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment 
options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. Expanded access studies conducted under this program are uncontrolled, carried out by individual investigators and not typically conducted in strict compliance with cGCPs, all of which can lead to a treatment effect which may differ from that in placebo-controlled trials. These studies provide only anecdotal evidence of efficacy for regulatory review. These studies contain no control or comparator group for reference and these patient data are not designed to be aggregated or reported as study results. Moreover, data from such small numbers of patients may be highly variable. Information obtained from our Expanded Access Program may not reliably predict the efficacy of our product candidates in company-sponsored clinical trials and may lead to adverse events that could limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval with labeling that we consider desirable, or at all.
Larazotide for the Treatment of Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C)
We entered into a collaboration with the European Biomedical Research Institute of Salerno, Italy (EBRIS) to study larazotide for the treatment of MIS-C. MIS-C is a rare and serious complication of COVID-19 with symptoms that resemble those of Kawasaki disease, potentially including persistent fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, myocardial dysfunction, and cardiogenic shock with ventricular dysfunction in the setting of multisystem inflammation. MIS-C occurs when SARS-CoV-2 superantigens move through the tight junctions between the gut epithelial cells into the bloodstream, leading to the hyperinflammatory immune response. We believe that larazotide’s mechanism of action as a tight junction regulator may prevent SARS-CoV-2 superantigens from entering the bloodstream. Following receipt of a Study May Proceed letter from the FDA under a recently filed Investigator IND, EBRIS initiated a Phase 2a study in MIS-C in the fourth quarter of 2021 to evaluate the use of larazotide in a group of children through a randomized placebo-controlled trial at MassGeneral Hospital for Children led by pediatric pulmonologist Lael Yonker, M.D. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we will supply larazotide for the purposes of the clinical study and EBRIS will be responsible for conducting the Phase 2a trial inclusive of all associated clinical costs.

Product Candidates being Evaluated for Development in Rare or Debilitating Digestive Diseases with Unmet Needs
NM-102, a small molecule peptide, is being developed as a potential microbiome modulator and is undergoing an indication selection process. NM-102 is a long-acting, degradation-resistant peptide, believed to be gut-restricted, and presumed to prevent antigens from trafficking into systemic circulation. Researchers found that NM-102 was effective alone or when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in a pre-clinical transgenic mouse model of spontaneous aggressive skin melanoma. Furthermore, the combination of NM-102 with ICIs improved survival compared to ICIs alone. We are currently progressing NM-102 through IND-enabling studies. On November 10, 2021, we entered into a collaboration with Gustave Roussy to investigate how tumors in preclinical models may affect intestinal integrity and in turn compromise the fitness of the host’s immune system and its capacity to respond to ICIs. Further work is planned to decipher the 
mechanism of NM-102 and its effects on intervening on the epithelial layer of the GI tract, as well as its potential translation to ICI efficacy in preclinical cancer in vivo models. Furthermore, on March 2, 2022, we announced a collaboration with NYU Langone Health investigating the pre-clinical use of NM-102 for an undisclosed autoimmune condition with a large unmet need. 
NM-003 is a proprietary long-acting GLP-2 agonist with improved serum half-life compared with short-acting versions, which we intend to progress through a clinical and regulatory pathway in an undisclosed orphan and rare GI indication. On December 9, 2020, we announced that the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to NM-003, a proprietary long-acting GLP-2 receptor agonist, for prevention of acute graft versus host disease. NM-003, also called teduglutide, is designed as a long-acting injectable GLP-2 receptor agonist that utilizes proprietary XTEN® technology to extend circulating half-life. NM-003 is currently undergoing an indication selection process through an ongoing probability of technical and regulatory success analysis. 
NM-136 targets glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), a hormone found in the upper small intestine that is released into circulation after food is ingested, and when found in high concentrations, can contribute to obesity and obesity-related disorders. NM-136 has been shown to prevent GIP from binding to its receptor, which in a preclinical obesity model showed a significant decrease in weight and abdominal fat by reducing nutrient absorption from the intestine as well as nutrient storage without affecting appetite. We are continuing the manufacturing and IND-enabling studies of NM-136 and intend to initiate a clinical proof-of-concept study in 2023. 

NM-004 is a double-cleaved mesalamine with an immunomodulator. NM-004 is also undergoing a portfolio rationalization and indication selection process. NM-004 is patent-protected and has orphan designation for pediatric ulcerative colitis. 
Our Intellectual Property

We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our product candidates and our processes. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, their methods of use and processes of manufacture, and any other technology to which we have rights, as appropriate. Additionally, we have licensed the rights to intellectual property related to certain of our product candidates, including patents and patent applications that cover the products or their methods of use or processes of manufacture. The terms of the licenses are described below under the heading “Licensing Agreements.” We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
In addition to patents and applications that we have licensed, we are the owner or co-owner of patent applications that have been filed relating to potential expansion of our product pipeline. We are the owner or co-owner of 2 issued or allowed U.S. patents and 2 issued or allowed foreign patents, as well as 32 pending patent applications covering formulations of larazotide and related compounds and methods of use for larazotide and related compounds (including NM-102). Some of these applications are co-owned with North Carolina State University, University of Maryland, Baltimore, or Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. In addition, we are the owner of two pending patent applications relating to uses and formulations of APAZA (NM-004) and related molecules. We are also the owner of a pending patent application covering methods of use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including vurolenatide. The patents and patent applications that we own or co-own provide patent terms or anticipated patent terms ranging from 2038 to 2043.

Our success will in part depend on the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, the validity and enforceability of our patents, the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets, and our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology and products. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Licensing Agreements

License with Alba Therapeutics Corporation

In February 2016, we entered into a license agreement (the “Alba License”) with Alba Therapeutics Corporation (“Alba”) to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property relating to larazotide and related compounds.
Our initial area of focus for this asset relates to the treatment of CeD. We now refer to this program as larazotide or NM-001. The license agreement gives us the rights to (i) patent families owned by University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and licensed to Alba, (ii) certain patent families owned by Alba, and (iii) two patent families that are jointly owned by Alba and UMB. In connection with the Alba License, we also entered into a sublicense agreement with Alba under which Alba sublicensed the UMB patents to us (the “Alba Sublicense”).

As consideration for the Alba License, we agreed to pay (i) a one-time, non-refundable fee of $0.4 million at the time of execution and (ii) set payments totaling up to $151.5 million upon the achievement of certain milestones in connection with the development of the product, which milestones include the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 clinical trial, acceptance and approval of the New Drug Application, the first commercial sale, and the achievement of certain net sales targets. The last milestone payment is due upon the achievement of annual net sales of larazotide in excess of $1.5 billion. Upon the first commercial sale of larazotide, the license becomes perpetual and irrevocable. The term of the Alba Sublicense, for which we paid a one-time, non-refundable fee of $0.1 million, extends until the earlier of (i) the termination of the Alba License, (ii) the termination of the underlying license agreement, or (iii) an assignment of the underlying license agreement to us. The patents subject to the Alba sublicense have since expired. During 2019, we paid Alba a milestone payment of $0.3 million for the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 3 clinical trial. If we are able to demonstrate sufficient financial resources to complete the trial, we have the exclusive option to purchase the assets covered by the license.

The patents covering the composition-of-matter for the larazotide peptide are recently expired. The Alba Therapeutics patent estate nevertheless includes issued patents that provide product exclusivity for larazotide in the U.S. until June 4, 2031, not including patent term extensions that may apply upon product approval. Outside the U.S., the Alba Therapeutics patent estate includes issued patents that provide product exclusivity for larazotide until February 9, 2027, not including patent term extensions, such as Supplementary Protection Certificate, that may apply in various jurisdictions.

Significant patents in the larazotide patent estate include issued patents in the U.S. for methods of treating CeD with larazotide, (US Patents 8,034,776 and 9,279,807), of which the last to expire has a term to July 16, 2030. 
Other significant patents include the larazotide formulation patent family, which has three issued U.S. patents as well as 46 issued outside the U.S. The significant patents in the larazotide patent estate formulation patent family includes patents covering the drug product composition-of-matter (US Patent 9,265,811) and corresponding methods of treatment (U.S. Patents 8,168,594 and 9,241,969) for the larazotide formulation, with the last to expire patent having an expiration in the U.S. of June 4, 2031, and which may be the subject of Patent Term Extension upon approval.
The Alba Therapeutics patent estate further includes one patent family relating to the clinical dose and use for larazotide, and which is pending in the U.S., Europe, Canada, China and Hong Kong. If issued, this patent would provide exclusivity for the larazotide program through April 3, 2035, not including patent term extensions that may apply. The Alba Therapeutics patent estate also includes one issued U.S. patent covering the NM-102 program through May 6, 2029.
License with Seachaid Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

In April 2013, we entered into a sub-license agreement (the “Seachaid License”) with Seachaid Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Seachaid”) to further develop and commercialize the licensed product, known as APAZA, or NM-004. Seachaid controlled rights to these patents by a license from Biocon Ltd.
The license agreement gives us the exclusive rights to (i) commercialize products covered by the patents owned or controlled by Seachaid related to the composition, formulation, use, or manufacture of any NM-004 compound in the territory that includes the U.S., Canada, Japan and most countries in Europe and (ii) use, research, develop, export and make products worldwide for the purposes of such commercialization.

As consideration for the Seachaid License, we agreed to pay a one-time, non-refundable fee of $0.2 million at the earlier of the time we meet certain financing levels or 18 months following the execution of the agreement and set payments totaling up to $6.0 million upon the achievement of certain milestones in connection with the development of the product, filing of the New Drug Application, the first commercial sale, and payments ranging from $1.0 million to $2.5 million based on the achievement of certain net sales targets. There are future royalty payments in the single digits based on achieving sales targets and we are required to pay Seachaid a portion of any sublicense revenue. The royalty payments continue for each licensed product and in each applicable country until the earlier of (i) the date of expiration of the last valid claim for such products or (ii) the date that one or more generic equivalents of such product makes up 50% or more of sales in the applicable country. The term of the Seachaid License extends on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the royalty period for the applicable product in the applicable country.
The Seachaid patent estate includes issued patents for: 
i.methods and compositions employing 4-aminophenylacetic acid, of which the last to expire has a term to March 22, 2025 (in the U.S. and Europe); and
ii.synthesis of azo bonded immunoregulatory compounds, of which the last to expire has a term to May 31, 2028 (in the U.S.) and July 7, 2025 (in Europe).
License Agreement with Amunix 
In connection with the Naia Acquisition, we entered into two amended and restated license agreements with Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Amunix”), pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with rights of sublicense, to lead molecules exenatide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) and GLP-2 analog fused to an XTEN amino acids sequence and other intellectual property referenced therein (the “Amunix Licenses”). Also in connection with the Naia Acquisition, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“Cedars”), pursuant to which we licensed the rights to GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of SBS (the “Cedars License” and together with the Amunix Licenses, the “Naia Licenses”). Collectively, the Naia Licenses are intended to support our development of a therapy to treat SBS, which we refer to as NM-002.
Naia paid initial license fees and other development milestone payments due under the Naia Licenses prior to the Naia Acquisition, therefore, we did not pay any initial license fees upon the amendment and restatement of the original Naia Licenses. Pursuant to the terms of the Amunix Licenses, we agreed to expend in certain minimum financial amounts in direct support of development of the GLP-1 and GLP-2 products during specified development stages.
As consideration under the Amunix License for the GLP-1 receptor agonist rights, we agreed to pay Amunix certain royalty payments and (i) $70.4 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones in the U.S. and major EU countries, (ii) $20.5 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones in China and certain related territories, and (iii) $20.5 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones in South Korea and certain other East Asian countries. As consideration under the Amunix License for GLP-2 rights, we agreed to pay Amunix certain royalty payments and $60.1 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones in the U.S. and major EU countries.
As consideration under the Cedars License, we agreed to pay Cedars certain royalty payments and approximately $9.4 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones.
The majority of the intellectual property licensed from Amunix is controlled and maintained by Amunix and relates to their proprietary XTEN fusion protein technology, including fusion protein compositions, methods of use, and methods of manufacturing.
License Agreement with MHS Care Innovation LLC
During July 2021, we entered into an amended and restated technology license agreement with MHS Care-Innovation LLC (“MHS”), pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide license, with rights to sublicense, to certain patent and other intellectual property rights concerning a proprietary and highly specific humanized monoclonal antibody that targets glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (the “MHS License”). The MHS License does not require the payment of any future milestone payments or royalties to MHS, since it was originally entered into with Lobesity in exchange for the issuance of certain equity securities and a grant of certain related rights to Lobesity, all of which occurred prior to the execution of the MHS License. As consideration for the assets purchased in the Lobesity Acquisition (including but not limited to the MHS License), we are obligated to pay Lobesity (i) potential worldwide regulatory and clinical milestone payments totaling $45.5 million for a single indication (with the total amount payable, if multiple indication are developed, not to exceed $58.0 million), (ii) up to $50.0 million in global sales-related milestone payments, and (iii) subject to certain adjustments, a mid-single digit royalty on worldwide net sales. 
License Agreement with EBRIS
On August 6, 2021, we announced a collaboration with EBRIS to study larazotide for the treatment of MIS-C. In connection with this collaboration, the Company paid a milestone fee of $0.5 million upon IND approval for MIS-C. 

Manufacturing and Supply 

We contract with third parties for the manufacturing of all of our product candidates, and for pre-clinical and clinical studies and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and we have no plans to build any owned clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the use of contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) eliminates the need to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, our personnel and consultants have extensive manufacturing experience overseeing CMOs.
As we further develop our molecules, we expect to consider secondary or back-up manufacturers for both active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for our product candidates in a timely manner. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demand but we have not assessed these capabilities beyond the supply of clinical materials to date. We currently engage CMOs on a ‘‘fee for services’’ basis based on our current development plans. We plan to identify CMOs and enter into longer term contracts or commitments as we move our product candidates into Phase 3 clinical trials.

We believe alternate sources of manufacturing will be available to satisfy our clinical and future commercial requirements; however, we cannot guarantee that identifying and establishing alternative relationships with such sources will be successful, cost effective, or completed on a timely basis without significant delay in the development or commercialization of our product candidates. All of the vendors we use are required to conduct their operations under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, a regulatory standard for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.

Competition 

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. Our potential competitors include both major and specialty pharmaceutical companies worldwide. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop, and manage a portfolio of safe and effective product candidates that address the unmet needs of patients.
The competitive landscape in SBS is currently limited, which we believe is due to the previous regulatory precedent set by the approved agent teduglutide. To our knowledge, there are two therapies (glepaglutide and apraglutide) currently in Phase 3 trials, both of which are GLP-2 agonists, as well as a dual GLP-1/GLP-2 agonist (dapiglutide), and a dual GLP-1/glucagon agonist (efinopegdutide) in Phase 1. To our knowledge, there is no single agent approach dedicated to studying SBS patients using a GLP-1 agonist approach other than vurolenatide. A summary of the drugs in development for SBS is below:
The competitive landscape in CeD has been limited historically, which we believe is due to lack of significant past research and development investments and lack of recognition and education around the disease. To our knowledge, there are no late-stage competitors entering Phase 3 clinical trials or any who have successfully completed Phase 2 studies to date. However, in recent years large pharmaceutical companies have begun to expand their focus areas to autoimmune diseases such as CeD, and given the unmet medical needs in these areas, we anticipate increasing competition. We are aware of 12 different products in Phase 1 or 2 development. These products are classified within 6 classes, as follows: gluten protein degradation agents, monoclonal antibodies, immune tolerance induces, integrin inhibitors, TG2 inhibitors, and recombinant bovine IAP. A summary of the drugs in development for CeD is listed below: 
Government Regulations

The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs, such as those we are developing. Along with third-party contractors, we will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Government Regulation of Drugs

Before any of our drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States, they must be approved by the FDA. The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee for each clinical site before a clinical trial can begin;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its intended purpose;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, after completion of all required clinical trials;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if required by the FDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States, which must be updated annually and when significant changes are made.

The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort, and financial resources and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing, information and/or post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product candidate.

If regulatory approval of a product candidate is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-
marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
A sponsor may seek approval of a product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drug candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, a new drug candidate is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition, fill an unmet medical need, and demonstrate a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness in the treatment of that condition.  The FDA has granted larazotide Fast Track designation for CeD. 
A drug that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for the following:
•more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval;
•more frequent written correspondence from FDA about the design of clinical trials;
•priority review to shorten the FDA review process for a new drug from ten months to six months; and,
•rolling review, which means 9 Meters can submit completed sections of its NDA for review by FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the application is completed before the entire application can be reviewed.

Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the NDA for review on a rolling basis. We may seek designation as a breakthrough therapy for some or all of our product candidates. 
If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include: 
•holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the product candidate;
•providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; 
•involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; 
•assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and
•considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller or more efficient clinical trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. 

Fast Track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

Orphan Drug Status

NM-002 has received orphan drug designation by the FDA. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug candidate intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Although there may be some increased communication opportunities, orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product, as defined by the FDA, or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.

As in the United States, designation as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union must be made before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product.

Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) determines that the request for designation was materially defective, or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition or if the incidence and prevalence of patients who are eligible to receive the drug in these markets materially increase. The inability to obtain or failure to maintain adequate product exclusivity for our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements

Our sales, promotion, medical education, clinical research, and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) and other division of DHHS, and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs and interactions with healthcare professionals must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the civil False Claims Act, the Physician Self-Referral law (the “Stark Law”), physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and other federal and state laws similar to the foregoing.
Our business and our relationships with customers, physicians, and third-party payors are and will continue to be subject, directly and indirectly, to federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations. These laws also apply to the physicians and third-party payors who will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our product candidates, if they become commercially available products. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we might market, sell and distribute our products and will impact, among other things, any proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. There are also laws, regulations and requirements applicable to the award and performance of federal grants and contracts. 

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to them, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the reimbursement of overpayments, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and earnings—any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare related laws and regulations include but are not limited to the following:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing, or the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchase, lease or order, of any good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program;
•the civil federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; conspiring to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•the criminal federal False Claims Act, which imposes criminal fines or imprisonment against individuals or entities who willfully make or present a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent;
•the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”), which imposes obligations on certain covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements; HIPAA also imposes criminal liability for, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
•the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;
•federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Sunshine Act (PSA) created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations. The PSA requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members; and
•analogous or similar state, federal, and foreign laws, regulations, and requirements—such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws—which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; laws, regulations, and requirements applicable to the award and performance of federal contracts and grants and state, federal and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health and other information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other laws, regulations, or other requirements that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, restitution exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, debarment from government contracts and grants and refusal of future orders under existing contracts, contractual damages, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations and other consequences. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, that person or entity may be subject to criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Moreover, availability of any federal grant funds which we may receive or for which we may apply is subject to federal appropriations law. Such grant funding may also be withdrawn or denied due to a violation of the above laws and/or for other reasons.

In addition to the foregoing health care laws, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We adopted an anti-corruption policy as a part of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics in January 2021. The anti-corruption policy mandates compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws applicable to our business throughout the world. However, we cannot assure you that such a policy, or the procedures implemented to enforce such a policy, will protect us from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, collaborators, or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and could have a negative impact on our business, on the results of our operations, and on our reputation.
Coverage and Reimbursement

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement are provided by third-party payers. Third-party payers include state and federal government health care programs, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payers will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, we cannot be certain of this. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the cost-effectiveness and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective and thus may not be covered or sufficiently reimbursed. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, as each payer will make its own determination as to whether to cover a product and at what level of reimbursement. Thus, one payer’s decision to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that another payer will provide coverage or that the reimbursement levels will be adequate. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow them to sell our product candidates on a competitive and profitable basis.
Healthcare Reform

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare delivery and payment systems in ways that could materially affect our ability to sell our products, if approved, profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, and/or expanding access to healthcare services. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.

By way of example, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud 
and abuse, promote quality improvement and evidence-based care, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. 
Efforts to reform the healthcare sector are ongoing. Since its enactment, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) repealed the Affordable Care Act’s “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision of the Affordable Care Act, which required most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. It is unclear what impact the repeal of the individual mandate will have on the viability of the insurance marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act or on the need for future reforms. The Trump administration also took executive actions to delay implementation of portions of the Affordable Care Act, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act’s “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act to increase the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” These revisions became effective January 1, 2019. 
The Biden administration has signaled that it plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to expand the number of people who are presently eligible for subsidies under the law. On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued a new Executive Order directing federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care and to consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this Executive Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents. 
The prices of prescription drugs have been the subject of considerable discussion and debate in the United States and abroad. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries into prescription drug pricing, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain and maintain profitability of our product candidates, if approved.
 The Budget Control Act of 2011, for instance, created, among other things, measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction in funding to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020—and also extended the sequester by one year, through 2030. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 also reduced Medicare payments to certain providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws, and others, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug formularies and other health care programs. These measures could reduce 
the ultimate demand for our product candidates, if approved, and/or may constrain the prices that we are able to charge for such products. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
We expect further reform to the Affordable Care Act, to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and to the regulation of the healthcare sector generally. Some of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Ongoing and future healthcare reform measures may result, for instance, in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for our product candidates, if approved, and could harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.

Foreign Regulation

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to develop or sell any product candidates outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement and privacy, can vary greatly from country to country.
