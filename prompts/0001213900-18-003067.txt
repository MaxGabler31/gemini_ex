Genie Retail Energy
 
Genie Retail Energy is comprised of REPs and related businesses. GRE’s REP businesses purchase electricity and natural gas on the wholesale markets and resell these commodities to their residential and business customers. The positive difference between the net sales price of electricity and natural gas sold to its customers and the cost of their electricity and natural gas supplies and related costs are the REP businesses’ gross profits.
 
GRE’s REP businesses operate in certain utility territories within the deregulated retail energy markets of twelve states in the Eastern and Midwestern US: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Rhode Island, as well as in Washington, D.C.
 
GRE’s US REP businesses operate under several brand names including IDT Energy, Residents Energy, Town Square Energy and Mirabito. Their diverse offerings, in both the electricity and natural gas markets include, variable rate offerings, fixed rate offerings, and green renewable offerings.

As part of our ongoing business development efforts, we seek out new opportunities in domestic and international jurisdictions, however, there are no assurances we will be successful in launching any such operations.
 
Historically, GRE’s REP businesses have expanded organically – adding new customers through customer acquisition programs at a rate faster than customers lost through attrition or churn. New customers are generally acquired through a combination of marketing and sales channels including door-to-door solicitation, telemarketing, online and digital marketing, direct mail, and by competitive bidding for exclusive contracts awarded by certain municipalities that, when authorized by state laws, award participating residents’ electricity supply to a single supplier.
 
Customer churn is a significant factor in the REP business, with monthly churn rates for GRE’s REPs averaging between four and eight percent per month. Customer churn tends to decrease when commodity prices fall, when weather-driven consumption decreases, when the price to REP customers decreases relative to competitors including the incumbent utility provider, or when the REPs incentivize customer tenure. Customer churn tends to increase when commodity prices rise, when weather driven consumption increases or spikes, or when the price to REP customers increases relative to the prices charged by competitors including incumbent utility providers. Newly acquired customers have higher rates of churn than longer-term customers.
 
GRE also operates several smaller non-REP businesses under its Genie Retail Energy Services (GRES) division, including Diversegy and Genie Solar Energy. Diversegy operates as an energy broker and advisor to industrial, commercial and municipal customers across deregulated energy markets in the United States. Diversegy’s customers are typically not served by GRE REPs.
 
Genie Solar Energy operates as a provider of end-to-end solar solutions primarily for commercial customers in five states – Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.
 
In November 2016, GRE closed on the acquisition of Retail Energy Holdings, LLC (REH), a privately held retail electricity provider operating under the Town Square Energy brand. The acquisition added approximately 48,000 RCEs to GRE’s customer base. Town Square Energy, operates in eight Eastern states and its licenses and customer base expanded GRE’s geographic footprint to four new states – New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut – and provided additional electricity customers in New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
 
On July 17, 2017, a Company subsidiary entered into a definitive agreement with Energy Global Investments Pty Ltd (“EGC”) to launch a joint venture to offer electricity and natural gas service to residential and small business customers in the United Kingdom under the brand Orbit Energy. In December 2017, Orbit commenced initial customer acquisition in the UK under the mandated three-month Controlled Market Entry framework in which new entrants can acquire a limited number of customers in a test environment.
 
On August 10, 2017, GRE acquired Mirabito Natural Gas, a Ft. Lauderdale, Florida-based natural gas supplier, from Angus Partners, LLC (“Angus”). Mirabito serves commercial and government customers throughout Florida.
 
For the past two years, GRE’s REP businesses expanded to new markets both to accelerate growth of our customer base and to reduce operational and regulatory risk associated with heavy geographical concentration.
 
GRE’s revenue has comprised 100% of our total consolidated revenue since our inception. In 2017, GRE generated revenue of $264 million comprised of $222 million from sales of electricity, $40 million from sales of natural gas, and other revenue of $2 million, as compared with revenue of $212 million in 2016, comprised of $179 million from the sales of electricity, $31 million from the sales of natural gas and other revenue of $2 million. Electricity sales have become a more significant portion of GRE’s business in recent years.
 
GRE’s REP operations are seasonal. Approximately 45% and 43% of our natural gas revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively, were generated during the first quarter, when the demand for heating peaks. Although the demand for electricity is not as seasonal as natural gas, approximately 30% and 31% of total revenues from electricity sales in 2017 and 2016 were generated in the third quarter when the demand for cooling peeks.
 
Variations in weather can significantly impact GRE’s operations. For example, unusually sustained cold weather in the first quarter of 2014 drove increased demand creating a “polar vortex” that was characterized by extraordinarily large spikes in the prices of wholesale electricity and natural gas in markets where GRE’s REPs and other retail providers purchase their supply.
 
REP Industry Overview
 
Retail energy providers (REPs) operate in deregulated retail energy markets in the US and overseas. REPs purchase electricity and natural gas on the wholesale markets and resell the commodities to their customers, who may include homeowners, renters and small to mid-sized commercial and governmental operations and institutions. Generally, incumbent local utilities continue to handle electricity and natural gas distribution, billing, and collections. The utilities remit the proceeds collected for the commodity supply portion of their bills less certain fees to the REPs.

REPs generally have no significant fixed assets and low levels of capital expenditure. Their cost of revenues is incurred to purchase electricity and natural gas in their respective wholesale markets and other factors. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily related to customer acquisition, customer retention, billing and purchase of receivables, or POR, fees paid to the utilities, and program management.
 
As of December 31, 2017, there were thirty states in which there is some level of energy deregulation. We currently market in all the states where there is residential deregulation covering both electricity and natural gas. We are in the process of applying for licenses or setting up operations in two additional states and are constantly evaluating entrance into new markets. Internationally, many of the most heavily populated countries in western Europe, are deregulated. In addition, Japan and other Asian countries have recently deregulated residential energy markets as well.
 
Customers; Marketing
 
The services of GRE’s REPs - IDT Energy, Residents Energy, Town Square Energy and Mirabito - are made available to customers under several offerings with distinct terms and conditions. The majority of our customer base is enrolled in variable rate programs via automatically renewing or month-to-month agreements, which enable us to recover our wholesale costs for electricity and natural gas through adjustments to the rates charged to our customers. The frequency and degree of these rate adjustments is determined by GRE, and is not restricted by regulation.
 
As of December 31, 2017, customers on variable rate products constituted 61% of the electric load, with the balance from customers on fixed rate agreements. For our variable rate product, the amount we charge to our customers reflects the underlying commodity cost plus a markup. During times of decreasing or stable costs, we typically experience lower rates of churn than when costs are increasing.
 
Variable rate products are available to all customers in all states served by GRE’s REPs except for Connecticut. Likewise, Renewable (Green) energy supply options exist in all markets served by GRE’s REPs. Renewable (Green) Electricity supply is 100% matched with renewable energy certificates that reflect the generation of electricity from sources such as hydro-electric wind, solar and biomass.
 
The electricity and natural gas we sell through all of our offerings are metered and delivered to customers by the local utilities. The utilities also provide billing and collection services for the majority of our customers. For a small number of direct bill customers, we perform our own billing and collection. Additionally, GRE’s REPs’ receivables are, in many states, purchased by the utilities in whose areas we operate for a percentage of their face value (over the course of 2017, the associated cost was approximately 1.4% of revenue) in exchange for the utility receiving a first priority lien in the customer receivable without recourse against the REP.
 
GRE’s REPs market their energy services primarily through direct marketing methods, including door-to-door sales, outbound telemarketing direct mail and internet signup. As of December 31, 2017, GRE serviced 412,000 meters (307,000 electric and 105,000 natural gas), as compared to 412,000 meters (296,000 electric and 116,000 natural gas) as of December 31, 2016.
 
GRE seeks to acquire profitable customers in low-risk markets, specifically where the utilities have adopted a portfolio of REP-friendly, regulatory-driven programs. Among these programs is purchase of receivables (POR) programs. Under POR programs, utilities are contractually obligated to purchase customer receivables at pre-determined and fixed discounts. Utilities also offer consolidated billing as part of the POR program. Through consolidated billing, the utilities retain the responsibility for billing the individual customer and the subsequent collection of the remittances. There are markets in which we operate that the utilities engage in consolidated billing on behalf of REP’s but are not obligated to guarantee the receivables.
 
Utilities in Connecticut, Delaware, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Washington, D.C., Massachusetts and Maryland offer POR programs, without recourse, that permit customers with past-due balances to remain in the POR and consolidated bill programs. However, utilities in New Jersey generally do not permit customers with past-due balances beyond 120 days to enroll or remain in their POR programs, which means that after a certain amount of time (determined based on the specific commodity), the REP becomes responsible for the billing and collection of the commodity portion of the future invoices for its delinquent customers. Utilities in New Hampshire and Rhode Island do not offer POR but they do offer consolidated billing. In Florida, there is no POR and we bill customers directly.
 
Additionally, GRE targets markets in which we can procure energy in an efficient and transparent manner. We seek to purchase wholesale energy where there is a real-time market that reflects a fair price for the commodity for all participants. This allows GRE to reflect a true market cost base and adjust its rates to its variable rate customers taking into account prevailing market rates.
 
We regularly monitor other deregulated or deregulating markets to determine if they are appropriate for entry, and may initiate the licensing process in a selected region to facilitate entry into the region contingent upon favorable deregulatory developments.

Acquisition and Management of Gas and Electric Supply
 
Since 2009, certain of GRE’s REPs have been party to a Preferred Supplier Agreement with BP Energy Company, or BP. The agreement allows for purchases of electricity and natural gas for customers focused in areas where the utilities have POR programs. Under the arrangement, those REPs purchase electricity and natural gas from BP at market rate plus a fee. The obligations to BP are secured by a first security interest in deposits or receivables from utilities in connection with their purchase of the REPs’ customer’s receivables under the applicable POR program, and in any cash deposits or letters of credit posted in connection with any collateral accounts with BP. The agreement with BP has been amended to cover the territories in which we operate. The agreement was modified and extended on November 19, 2015, and is scheduled to terminate on November 30, 2019. Our ability to purchase electricity and natural gas under this agreement is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including the maintenance of certain covenants.


GRE is required to meet certain minimum green energy supply criteria in some of the markets in which it operates. We meet those thresholds by acquiring renewable energy certificates, or REC’s. In addition, GRE offers green or other renewable energy products to its customers in all of the territories in which we operate. GRE acquires green renewable energy conversion rights or attributes and REC’s to satisfy the load requirements for these customers.
 
GRE does not own electrical power generation, transmission, or distribution facilities, or natural gas production, pipeline or distribution facilities. GRE’s REPs currently contract with Dominion Transmission, Inc., National Fuel Supply, Williams Gas Pipeline and Texas Eastern Transmission and others for natural gas pipeline, storage and transportation services, and utilizes the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., or NYISO, and PJM Interconnection, LLC, or PJM, for electric transmission and distribution. NYISO operates the high-voltage electric transmission network in New York State, and administers and monitors New York’s wholesale electricity markets. PJM is a regional transmission organization that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of thirteen states (including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Illinois) and the District of Columbia.
 
For risk management purposes, GRE’s REPs utilize forward physical delivery contracts for a portion of their purchases of electricity and natural gas, which are defined as commodity derivative contracts. In addition, GRE’s REPs enter into put and call options as hedges against unfavorable fluctuations in market prices of electricity and natural gas.
 
The ISOs perform real-time load balancing for each of the electrical power grids in which GRE REPs operate. Similarly, load balancing is performed by the utilities or local distribution company, or LDC, for each of the natural gas markets in which GRE operates. Load balancing ensures that the amount of electricity and natural gas that GRE’s REPs purchase is equal to the amount necessary to service its customers’ demands at any specific point in time. GRE’s REPs are charged or credited for balancing the electricity and natural gas purchased and sold for their account by their suppliers and the LDCs. GRE’s REPs manage the differences between the actual electricity and natural gas demands of their customers and their bulk or block purchases by buying and selling in the spot market, and through monthly cash settlements and/or adjustments to future deliveries in accordance with the load balancing performed by utilities, LDCs, and/or ISOs.
 
Competition
 
As an operator of REPs, GRE competes with the local utility companies in each of the markets in which it provides services and with many other licensed REPs. In some markets, competitor REPs are affiliated with local utilities. GRE also competes with several large vertically integrated energy companies. Competition with the utilities and REPs impacts GRE’s gross margins, customer acquisition rates and exposes GRE to customer churn.
 
REPs and utilities offering fixed rate products or guaranteed pricing often are unable to change their sell rates offered to customers in response to underlying commodity price volatility. In a downward moving commodity cost environment, variable rate REPs typically become more competitive as they benefit from the lag that utilities experience in reducing their sell rate to reflect the lower commodity costs, and they may benefit from decreases in margin pressure, improvements in the customer acquisition environment, and lower rates of churn. In a rising commodity cost environment, REPs that offer variable rate products, and reflect real-time commodity costs, will typically become less competitive with fixed rate providers, experience increased margin pressure, a more challenging customer acquisition environment and higher rates of customer churn.
 
Increasing our market share depends in part on our ability to persuade more customers to switch from other providers to one of our REPs at a higher rate than our customers churn to other providers. Moreover, local utilities and some REPs may have certain advantages such as name recognition, financial strength and long-standing relationships with customers. Persuading potential customers to switch to GRE requires significant marketing and sales operations.
 
Regulation
 
REPs such as ours must be licensed in each state and utility service territory in which they operate. Each is subject to the rules and regulations governing the operations of REPs in each jurisdiction.

Although the rates charged by GRE’s REPs are not regulated in the same way as the rates of utility companies, the manner in which the REPs market to potential customers, and the relationships between the REPs and their customers, are heavily regulated. GRE’s REPs must also comply with various quarterly and/or annual reporting requirements in order to maintain their eligibility to provide service. In certain jurisdictions the REPs are required to publish product offers with the applicable regulatory commissions, or in the public domain, generally on a website established for such purpose. In addition to the regulations that govern the relationships between GRE’s REPs and their customers, GRE’s REPs also maintain specific Terms & Conditions or Terms of Service for each product in each jurisdiction that customers must agree to be bound by.
 
Due to dramatic increases in wholesale electricity costs that occurred during the “polar vortex” of the winter of 2014, the retail electricity prices that GRE’s REPs and many other variable rate electricity suppliers charged to their customers increased sharply. These retail electricity price increases resulted in large numbers of complaints, regulatory actions, and calls for legislation, regulation and litigation. GRE’s subsidiary, IDT Energy, paid approximately $5 million in rebates to affected customers in the year ended December 31, 2014. These events adversely affected GRE’s REPs customer churn, gross margins and results of operations.
 
As discussed more fully below in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” in this Annual Report, IDT Energy reached a settlement with the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office and the Acting Consumer Advocate terminating litigation with no admission of liability or finding of wrongdoing by IDT Energy.
 
New York Public Service Commission Orders
 
On February 23, 2016, the New York Public Service Commission, or PSC, issued an order that sought to impose significant new restrictions on REPs operating in New York, including those owned by GRE. The restrictions described in the PSC’s order, which were to become effective March 4, 2016, would have required that all electricity and natural gas offerings offered by REPs to residential and small business customers include an annual guarantee of savings compared to the price charged by the relevant incumbent utility or, for electricity offerings, provide at least 30% of the supply from renewable sources. Customers not enrolled in a compliant program would be relinquished back to the local utility at the end of their contract period or, for variable price customers operating on month to month agreements, at the end of the current monthly billing cycle.
 
On March 4, 2016, a group of parties from the REP industry sought and won a temporary restraining order to stay implementation of the most restrictive portions of the PSC’s order pending a court hearing on those parties’ motion for a preliminary injunction. On July 25, 2016, the New York State Supreme Court, County of Albany, entered a decision and order granting the Petitioners’ petition, vacated provisions 1 through 3 of the Order, which outlined the proposed rule changes referenced above, and remitted the matter to the PSC for further proceedings consistent with the Court’s order. As a result of the litigation, in December 2016 the PSC opened an Evidentiary Proceeding to assess the condition of the REP market in New York and determine a path for the future of the market.
 
After submission of written testimony by numerous parties over the course of a year, in December 2017, the PSC held a ten-day evidentiary hearing in its offices in Albany. The parties now have an opportunity to submit post-hearing briefs. It is expected to be several more months before the PSC takes any definitive action. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of any new order from the PSC that would follow from the evidentiary process, while preparing to operate in compliance with any new requirements that may be imposed. Depending on the final language of any new order, as well as the Company’s ability to modify its relationships with its New York customers, an order could have a substantial impact upon the operations of GRE’s REPs in New York. As of December 31, 2017, New York represented 36% of GRE’s total meters served and 28% of the total residential customer equivalents (“RCEs”) of GRE’s customer base.
 
On July 14, 2016, and September 19, 2016, the PSC issued orders restricting REPs, including those owned by GRE, from serving customers enrolled in New York’s utility low-income assistance programs. Representatives of the REP industry challenged the ruling in New York State Supreme Court, Albany County, and, on September 27, 2016, the Court issued an order temporarily restraining the PSC from implementing the July and September orders. On December 16, 2016, the PSC issued an order (the “2016 Order”) prohibiting REP service to customers enrolled in New York’s utility low-income assistance programs. After an agreed-upon stay of the 2016 Order, on July 5, 2017, the New York State Supreme Court, Albany County, denied interested parties’ efforts to invalidate the 2016 Order. Several REPs have appealed the Supreme Court’s decision to the Appellate Division, Third Department. That court stayed implementation of the Order for a period of time, but later lifted the stay pending resolution of the appeal.


In a related action, several customers impacted by the 2016 Order filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, challenging the Order. Temporary stays of the 2016 Order entered in connection with this action have expired, and REPs are now required to return service of their current low-income customers to the relevant local incumbent utility on the modified schedule set forth in the PSC’s 2016 Order. GRE is complying with the NY PSC’s low-income order and has begun the transfer of customers as required. The order will require GRE’s REPs to transfer customer accounts comprising approximately 21,000 meters, representing 12,000 RCEs, to their respective incumbent utilities during the first half of 2018. As of December 31, 2017, GRE’s REPs operate in eight utility territories in New York, six utility territories in New Jersey, nine utility territories in Pennsylvania, four utility territories in Maryland, six utility territories in Ohio, five utility territories in Massachusetts, two utility territories in New Hampshire, two in Connecticut, one in Rhode Island, one in Washington, D.C. two in Illinois. The State of New York, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the State of New Jersey, the State of Maryland, the State of Illinois, the District of Columbia, the State of Ohio, the State of New Hampshire, the State of Rhode Island, the State of Connecticut, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the federal government, and related public service/utility commissions, among others, establish the rules and regulations for our REP operations. Orbit Energy, our joint venture based in London, has begun acquiring customers in England, Scotland and Wales.

Like all operators of REPs, GRE is affected by the actions of governmental agencies, mostly on the state level, by the respective state Public Service/Utility Commissions, and other organizations (such as NYISO and PJM) and indirectly by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Regulations applicable to electricity and natural gas have undergone substantial change over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. We may be subject to new laws, orders or regulations or the revision or interpretation of existing laws, orders or regulations.
 
As of December 31, 2017, Diversegy operated nationwide in all deregulated markets as a broker of electricity and as a gas broker.
 
Employees
 
As of March 1, 2018, GRE employed 178 full time employees, 69 of whom are located in the Jamestown, New York office, of which approximately 90% are affiliated with our customer care center, 52 of whom are located in our New Jersey office, 10 of whom are located in our Arizona office and 47 of whom are located in the Florida office performing customer acquisition and support.
Genie Oil and Gas, Inc.
 
Genie Oil and Gas (GOGAS) is an oil and gas exploration company. GOGAS currently holds an 86.1% interest in Afek, an inactive oil and gas exploration project which operated in the southern portion of the Golan Heights in Northern Israel and a 100% interest in Atid Oil & Gas, a contract drilling services company in Israel. In addition, GOGAS holds controlling interests in three inactive or disbanded oil shale projects in Mongolia, Colorado and Israel.
Afek Oil and Gas Ltd.
 
In April 2013, the Government of Israel finalized the award to Afek of an exclusive three-year petroleum exploration license covering 396.5 square kilometers in the southern portion of the Golan Heights. The license was subsequently extended to April 2018.
 
In February 2015, Afek began drilling its first exploratory well in Northern Israel’s Golan Heights. Afek completed drilling five wells in the Southern portion of its license area. In addition, Afek has undertaken well flow tests in multiple target zones within two of the completed wells. The results of the exploration program in this portion of the license area confirmed the presence of significant hydrocarbons in the basin, but the Afek concluded that the resource was likely not commercially viable given current and forecasted market conditions and other constraints, and that the greatest potential for commercial development lies in an area further north within the license area than any of the five completed exploratory wells.
 
In 2017, Afek turned its operational focus to the Northern region of its license area. The data analyzed suggested that the Southern block resources may extend Northward at depths potentially sufficient to have induced a greater level of maturation of the resource. To validate this hypothesis, in 2017, Afek drilled an exploratory well a site in the Northern portion of its license area. The company announced in November 2017 that the preliminary analysis of results from its completed Ness 10 exploratory well in Northern Israel suggests that the well’s target zone does not contain commercially producible quantities of oil or natural gas and that it was suspending drilling operations pending further analysis.
 
In light of the analysis received, Afek determined that, based on current information, it did not have a clear path to demonstrate probable or possible reserves in the license area over the next 12 to 18 months. Since there was substantial doubt regarding the economic viability of the well, in the three months ended December 31, 2017, Afek wrote off the $6.5 million of capitalized exploration costs incurred. At this time, no further exploration activity is contemplated.
 
Atid
 
In January 2017, we established Atid Drilling Ltd., (Atid), an on-shore drilling services venture based in Israel. Atid will serve as the primary drilling contractor for any future Afek drilling activities, and opportunistically pursue drilling opportunities for clients in a variety of fields including oil and gas exploration, water resource development and mineral exploration. Atid purchased a drilling rig and associated drilling equipment in 2017. The rig had successfully drilled five exploratory oil and gas wells in the Golan Heights for Afek over the past two years and completed a water well.
