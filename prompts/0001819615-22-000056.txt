Item 1. Business
Our Mission
Our mission is to innovate in cannabis products and services, from raw materials to finished products, in an environmentally friendly manner and to be an industry-leading global cannabinoid company recognized for our principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.
Our Company
We are a multi-national operator in the botanical cannabinoid and nutraceutical industries, with operations and investments in Colombia, Portugal, Germany, the United States and Canada. We are working to develop one of the industry’s leading, low-cost global business-to-business supply chains with the goal of providing high quality, pharmaceutical grade cannabis and wellness products to customers and patients at competitive prices produced in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. Our customers consist of retail distributors and pharmaceutical and cannabis companies.
We have invested in ecologically sustainable, large-scale, botanical cultivation and processing as the cornerstone of our medical cannabinoid business, and we continue to develop strategic distribution channels and brands. We currently own approximately 2.1 million square feet of greenhouse cultivation capacity across two continents and approximately 15 million square feet of agricultural land, with an option to acquire approximately 73 million additional square feet of land for cultivation expansion. In addition, our pharmaceutical-grade extraction facility is capable of processing 104,400 kilograms of dry flower per year and is expandable to over 300,000 kilograms of dry flower per year with limited additional investment.
In July 2020, we became one of a small number of vertically integrated cannabis companies in the world to receive European Union Good Manufacturing Practices (“EU GMP”) certification for our Colombian operations. We believe this certification provides us with one of the largest licensed and EU GMP certified capacities for cannabis cultivation and cannabinoid extraction globally, while our strategically located operations allow us to produce our products at a fraction of the average cost of production incurred by our peers in Canada and the United States.
In addition to the cannabinoid business, we are also engaged in the non-cannabinoid business of formulating, manufacturing, marketing, selling, distributing, and otherwise commercializing nutraceutical and other natural remedies and wellness products, to more than 20,000 retail locations across the United States, through our wholly owned subsidiary Herbal Brands, Inc. (“Herbal Brands”). Herbal Brands has an Arizona based GMP-compliant, Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) registered facility and is a national distributor of nutraceutical products. Along with nutraceutical products, after conducting research and development on variety of CBD products, Herbal Brands launched its first consumer brand, Joysol, to include cannabinoids (CBD) for distribution through its existing distribution channels in January 2022. Herbal Brands’ nationwide customer base provides a platform we intend to leverage for greater potential cannabinoid distribution in the future, should U.S. federal laws change and regulations permit.
Our principal operations are in four key geographies:
•Colombia. We believe we have one of the largest licensed productive capacity footprints to produce medical cannabis in Colombia with 18 greenhouses creating 1.8 million square feet of cultivation space. With 6 million square feet of leased or owned land, our greenhouse cultivation can be expanded to approximately 2.5 million square feet at our existing operating site. We also have an option to acquire approximately 73 million additional square feet of agricultural land for open field cannabis production. In 2020, our greenhouses, propagation area, and post-harvest facility were granted Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (“GACP”) certification by Control Union Medical Cannabis Standard (“CUMCS”). As a quality assurance standard, GACP certification increases our ability to attract customers and enables us to produce pharmaceutical-grade cannabis products for domestic and international markets. Our Colombian manufacturing facilities were granted Colombian GMP certification by the National Institute of Surveillance of Pharmaceuticals and Food (Instituto Nacional de Vigilancia de Medicamentos y Alimentos), Colombia’s food and drug regulatory agency (“INVIMA”) in August 2019 and EU GMP certification by the Croatian Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices “HALMED”) in July 2020. Our post-harvest facility also received EU GMP certification in July 2020. With 35 genetic strains of cannabinoids registered in Colombia, we are principally focused on cultivation, extraction and manufacturing activities.
•Portugal. Our European production operations are headquartered in Portugal where we own approximately 9 million square feet of agricultural and agro-industrial land, approximately 260,000 square feet of licensed and operational greenhouse facilities, and an EU GMP-compliant post-harvest facility which we intend to obtain EU GMP certification. We selected Portugal due to its agricultural conditions, relatively low operating costs compared to other European countries and access to high-quality facilities and talent. In 2020, National Authority of Medicine and Health Products (“INFARMED”) the Portuguese pharmaceutical regulator, which also regulates medical cannabis granted us a license, to cultivate, import and export GACP quality dried flower, produced from our Portuguese cultivation site. Our CUMC-GAP certification under the Control Union Medical Cannabis Standard expired in February 2022 and has been updated to the IMC-GAP standard certification in March 2022. Under the license granted by INFARMED, our production facility in Portugal is currently cultivating cannabis for commercial purposes.
•Germany. We are building a commercialization and distribution network for pharmaceutical cannabis in Germany through our own subsidiary Clever Leaves Germany GmbH which currently holds a wholesaler distribution license, Good Distribution Practices Certification, from the authorities in Hamburg, and a narcotics license from the Federal Opium Agency in Germany. We are leveraging relationships with local partners, such as Cansativa GmbH (“Cansativa”), a European Union Good Distribution Practices (“EU GDP”) and EU GMP certified and established cannabis importer and distributor, in which we have a minority interest. In late 2021, we launched and initiated sales of IQANNA, our pharmaceutical cannabinoid brand in Germany. Although we have yet to sell any products to or through Cansativa, we have a preferred supply relationship with Cansativa with respect to products sourced from Colombia and have recently entered into a multi-year sales agreement with them. We also entered into a sales agreement with a European manufacturer and distributor of pharmaceuticals products, for the sale of medical cannabis extracts produced in our EU GMP certified facilities in Colombia and have begun importing some of these extracts to Germany.
•United States. Through Herbal Brands, a GMP-compliant manufacturer and distributor of nutraceutical and wellness products to more than 20,000 retail locations in the United States, we have a platform we believe we can leverage for future cannabinoid distribution, subject to changes in U.S. federal law. In June 2020, we completed our first medical cannabis shipment into the Unites States for limited test purposes. Through Herbal Brands, we have conducted research and development on variety of CBD products, and launched JoySol, our first consumer brand to include cannabinoids, through existing distribution channels in January 2022. In 2021, we exported our first shipment of TCH flower commercially from Portugal to the United States for research purposes to licensed clients. Both imports received authorization from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”).
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors by virtue of the following strengths:
Leader in low-cost, high-quality pharma-grade cannabinoid cultivation and extraction
We believe we are well positioned to become a leader in low-cost, high quality and large-scale botanical cannabinoid production. In Colombia, we believe we have one of the largest licensed productive capacity footprints to produce medical cannabis with 18 greenhouses creating 1.8 million square feet of cultivation space. With 6 million square feet of leased or owned land, our greenhouse cultivating can be expanded to approximately 2.5 million square feet at our existing operating site. We also have an option to acquire approximately 73 million additional square feet of agricultural land for open field cannabis production. We have 104,400 kilograms of dry flower extraction capacity per year in one of the world’s few EU GMP certified vertically-integrated operations. In addition to the favorable climate, 12 hours of daily sunlight year-round and topographical benefits, Colombia’s lower cost of living, labor and construction costs (as compared to the United States or Canada) help to reduce labor overhead and capital expenditure, enabling us to operate and scale our business with operating costs that are competitive across our industry. In Portugal, we own approximately 9 million square feet of agricultural and agro-industrial land and approximately 260,000 square feet of existing licensed greenhouse facilities.
Pharmaceutical-grade, GMP-certified production
Our production chain has been awarded certifications which demonstrate compliance with some of the world’s most stringent pharmaceutical quality standards. With GACP certified cultivation and EU GMP certified post-harvest and extraction in Colombia, our EU GMP certified product portfolio is distinctive in that it includes active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), semi-finished and finished pharmaceutical products. We believe there are fewer than ten cannabis companies globally with the breadth of EU GMP certification that we were awarded for cannabis extracts, and we believe we are currently Latin America’s only cannabis producer with an EU GMP certification.
The EU GMP certification is a requirement for commercialization of pharmaceutical products in Europe and indicates that the products are produced to the high-quality requirements necessary in the European Union. The EU GMP certification governs the manufacture of medicinal products within the EU and constitutes one of the highest globally recognized product quality standards. The EU GMP certification asserts the manufacturer's compliance with consistent and controlled quality standards in the covered manufacturing processes of medicines and API. The EU GMP standards are compiled in the EU GMP Guidelines, which encompass the quality standards in the production, handling, storage and packaging of the medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.
A prerequisite under EU GMP is that medicinal products are of consistently high quality and provide detailed traceability of their components. As such, EU GMP provides our customers and potential customers comfort that our products may be more suitable for their intended use than those of our non-EU GMP certified competitors. Importantly, these customers may use the product in clinical trials and in obtaining marketing authorizations. As a result, our EU GMP certification facilitates the movement of goods, contributes to the credibility of our products and expands our ability to serve the burgeoning European medical cannabis markets, which are subject to strict quality, compliance and regulatory requirements.
For emerging medical cannabis markets that have not yet established quality standards, or which do not necessarily require EU GMP certification, EU GMP certification also serves as a strong quality signal, potentially attracting customers that may not otherwise require EU GMP certification. We expect that EU GMP certification will unlock new international markets that require such certification as well as higher price points for our products given the pharma-quality advantage and validation of quality and consistency.
The EU GMP certification we received in July 2020 covers the part of the manufacturing process that begins with the trimming of the flower at the cultivation site until packaging, which is conducted at our extraction facility in Colombia. If we develop a new product that requires a manufacturing process not covered by our existing EU GMP certification, we must request an audit of the new manufacturing process and its inclusion in our existing EU GMP certification.
Each EU GMP certification is granted to specific manufacturing processes, conducted under specific conditions and, thus, it is tied to the specific facility where those manufacturing conditions were audited and certified as compliant. The EU GMP certification we received is valid for three years, which is the maximum validity period, and is renewable upon assessment by EU GMP inspectors. In order to maintain our EU GMP certification, we are required to comply with the EU GMP Guidelines and may be subject to visits and information requests by EU GMP inspectors.
Optimized footprint for long-term
We have significant operations in Latin America, Europe and, with respect to our non-cannabinoid nutraceutical products, North America. Our business model is focused on geographic diversification and optimization, which we believe distinguishes us from many Canadian licensed producers ("LPs"), U.S. multi-state operators ("MSOs") and U.S. single-state operators ("SSOs"), which are commonly confined to one geography and may be reliant on initial market protections afforded by the existing regulatory framework in their respective jurisdictions. Unlike certain Canadian LPs, U.S. MSOs and SSOs, we can scale our production in low-cost regions of the world, such as Colombia and Portugal, while maintaining access to some higher value-added end markets such as the EU because of our EU GMP certification and our global operating network. We do not plan to relocate or outsource our production to low-cost regions in the future, since we are already established in the current geographies. U.S. MSOs typically construct semi-redundant or incompatible infrastructure due to state specific regulation and licensing and face a variety of legal and operational challenges because cannabis is not legal under U.S. federal law and interstate commerce is prohibited. Although certain Canadian LPs, U.S. MSOs and SSOs may benefit from restrictions on importation of cannabis or hemp from other geographies, creating current market protections, legalization of imported cannabinoid products, should this occur, may create future new opportunities in Canada and the United States for multi-national operator ("MNOs") and create competition for incumbents.
Developing export distribution channels
We continue to build our sales pipeline with businesses in various jurisdictions that have legalized medical cannabis derived products or low tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) and hemp derived products. To date, we have had export shipments of our cannabis products to Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. Germany, as the largest economy in the EU and a country with public insurance coverage for medical cannabis, is strategically positioned as our launch point for a further expansion into the European cannabis industry. We have established two conduits into Germany through our wholly owned subsidiary focused on the initial stage of importation, commercialization and distribution 
of medicinal cannabis, and our minority investment in Cansativa, one of the largest German GMP and GDP certified pharmaceutical cannabis importers and distributors.
Advantages from early establishment in Colombia
In Colombia, plant varietals cannot be commercialized until they have been registered with Colombian Agricultural Institute ("ICA"), the Colombian agricultural regulator. We have 35 genetic strains of cannabinoids registered in Colombia. Prior to December 2018, cannabis strains were subject to a more streamlined regulatory registration process by ICA. A cannabis producer entering the Colombian cannabis industry today would likely be required to comply with more stringent and lengthy genetics registration and quarantine protocols. 
In late July 2021, the Colombian government passed Decree 811, which replaced Decree 613. Decree 811 removed the prohibition contained in Decree 613 to allow the exportation of cannabis flowers. In February 2022, the Colombian government passed Regulation 227, which defines the procedures to begin cultivating cannabis for exporting the flower. An additional resolution defining the procedures for exporting is expected to be passed in the first half of 2022 by the Colombian government.
Our relatively long-term presence in Colombia and established track record with Colombian regulators has contributed to our receipt of some of the country’s first and largest quotas for the cultivation and extraction of high-THC cannabis products. In September 2020, the Colombian National Government declared our company as a National Strategic Interest Project (“PINE”), which means that Colombian governmental institutions will attempt to expedite processes, permits and documentation for Clever Leaves. We exported more than 50% of the total value of cannabis exports from Colombia in the first half of 2021. In 2019, we were the first company to receive Colombian GMP certification by INVIMA. These achievements, along with the EU GMP certification of our post-harvest and manufacturing sites in 2020, paved the way to become the first Colombian-based manufacturer to export commercial batches of EU GMP certified cannabis-based APIs to Europe in late 2021.
Talented and experienced leadership with operational and regulatory expertise
Our Company is led by a highly knowledgeable management team of experienced professionals. 
On February 8, 2022, our board of directors (the “Board”) and Kyle Detwiler, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and chairman of the Board (“Chairman”) mutually determined that Mr. Detwiler would step down from his positions effective as of March 24, 2022. On February 8, 2022, the Board appointed Andres Fajardo to replace Mr. Detwiler as CEO, effective as of March 25, 2022. Mr. Fajardo currently serves as our President and as a member of the Board. He has more than 20 years of management experience, having served as CEO of IQ Outsourcing, a leading Colombian business processing firm, and as a principal member at Booz & Company.
Julian Wilches, our Chief Regulatory Officer, brings extensive regulatory experience as he previously served as Director of Drug Policy for the Colombian Ministry of Justice and Law. 
Henry Hague III, our Chief Financial Officer, brings extensive experience in providing financial leadership to various public and private entities in the pharmaceutical, biomedical, and cannabinoid industries. 
David Kastin, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, leads our global legal and compliance function. Mr. Kastin has more than 25 years of experience in the legal profession with experience in representing companies in all facets of their businesses.
Our management team has significant experience identifying and scaling attractive business models, and with evaluating investment opportunities, partnerships, and other growth opportunities. We focus on making strategic decisions that will allow us to grow our business over the long-term and increase shareholder value. We intend to leverage this experience and existing relationships to build strategic partnerships with leading companies across the cannabis supply chain, including wellness, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical companies.
Our Strategy for Growth
We plan to utilize our existing infrastructure and make future incremental investments to drive sales growth in the rapidly expanding cannabis markets globally. We aspire to build a leading international low-cost and pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid company through the following strategies:
Securing strategic partnerships
Our business model is focused on partnering with leading and emerging cannabis and pharmaceutical businesses by providing them with lower cost product, variable cost structures, reliable supply throughout the year, and accelerated speed to market. We believe this is achievable due to our production locations, capacity, product registrations and various product certifications.
Expanding our sales and distribution footprint
We believe that our Latin American and European production footprint will allow us to take advantage of the opportunities arising from the growing global cannabis industry.
Our primary distribution channels are for wellness products and pharmaceutical products. We structure our sales efforts regionally into Latin America, the United States and rest of the world. Within each sales channel, there are a variety of products that we are licensed to manufacture and sell under various distribution arrangements. Our penetration of the wellness channel started with sales of Herbal Brands’ non-cannabis product lines in the United States. Our distribution of cannabis products to date consists of export shipments for commercial or research purposes to Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. However, we anticipate that our Colombian GACP, GMP and EU GMP certifications, our Portuguese GACP certifications, our German licenses, as well as our strategic investment in Cansativa will allow us to expand our pharmaceutical distribution channel, which typically has a higher margin but a longer sales cycle. In addition, Herbal Brands’ national distribution provides a platform to leverage for cannabinoid distribution in the future, subject to changes in federal law and as regulations permit.
We are focused on expanding in five main geographies: Australia, Brazil, Germany, Israel, and the Unites States.
•Australia: Our extracts and API sales from Colombia have been increasing to established cannabis companies in Australia. We started Portugal cannabis flower sales in late 2021. We expect Australia to become an important source of growth for our Company.
•Brazil: We have been generating initial API and final product sales under the “Compassionate Use” legal framework. We have also been working with our partners to obtain registration for our products under RDC 327 (Cannabis Framework), which would allow us to import and distribute products in Brazil. Our first product registration was granted in November 2021, and other products in our portfolio have received special marketing authorization under RDC 327. We are working on obtaining authorization for new products, some of which we expect to receive in the first half of 2022. We intend to leverage our EU GMP certification as well as advances in product development, including the utilization of zone IVb stability parameters, which are required in Brazil. The lack of zone IVb stability data has historically prevented large global cannabis companies from entering the Brazilian market.
•Germany: Distribution of medical cannabis products in Germany is regulated by the German national and federal pharmaceutical regulators. Cannabis products are prescribed by traditional and specialist physicians and fulfilled by pharmacies. The pharmacy industry is fragmented by law, with limits on ownership of multiple pharmacy locations. Imports of cannabis into Germany is facilitated by a limited set of licensed importers and distributors. In order to navigate the challenges of entering the German market and reducing our reliance on German import partners, we have executed a strategic investment in an EU GDP and EU GMP certified German distributor, Cansativa. As of December 31, 2021, we held an approximately 14% ownership interest in Cansativa and one advisory board seat. In the first quarter of 2022, we signed an agreement to sell a portion of our investment in Cansativa, reducing our equity ownership to approximately 9%. See Note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in this Form 10-K for more information. In Germany, we are actively commercializing API, establishing licensing partnerships with local and regional companies which includes a global pharmaceutical company, and commercializing IQANNA, our pharmaceutical cannabinoid brand that launched in late 2021. 
•Israel: Our extracts and API sales have been continuously growing in Israel since April 2020. In 2022, we expect Israel to become one of the largest markets for our Portuguese flower. We are developing partnerships with local companies to facilitate the import and launch of our product sales in Israel.
•United States: Our distribution in the United States currently comprises primarily Herbal Brands nutraceutical products. Either directly or through distributors, we distribute Herbal Brands products to more than 20,000 retail locations in the United States, which includes specialty and health retail stores. Most of our products are manufactured 
and distributed from our production facility in Tempe, Arizona. Herbal Brands launched JoySol, our first consumer brand to include cannabinoids, through its existing distribution channels in early 2022.
In addition, we are building relationships with businesses in other countries with the objective of preparing, planning or executing commercial shipments to such businesses, although completion of these shipments is not guaranteed and is subject to many evolving factors including regulatory progress and approvals, agreement on commercial terms, negotiation of definitive documentation, successful test shipments, and validation by third party laboratories. We believe these are attractive markets due to their long-term potential, stringent quality requirements that fit our supply chain strengths, and improving regulatory frameworks.
Capitalize on regulatory developments
As cannabis regulations evolve, we intend to broaden our product offering. 
In February 2022, the Colombian government passed a regulation that defines the procedures to begin cultivating cannabis for exporting the flower for medicinal use. We believe this represents a significant opportunity for our Company. Based on our experience in Portugal, we believe that growing and processing dry flower for sale as a final product is complex and relies on several competencies. We are leveraging our product development experience in Portugal to produce a product in Colombia that complies with global market requirements when launched. In addition, we are preparing our flower to be sold to extractors around the world. We believe that our GACP and EU GMP for the sale of cannabis flower, coupled with our cost position and previous experience in Portugal, positions us to benefit from this significant regulatory change.
We have seen an emergence of interest in products derived from hemp or cannabis that have non-detectable or ultra-low levels of THC. These products may be compliant with a broader range of regulations to facilitate CBD or other hemp-derived botanical products. Expanding our capacity for THC removal could yield additional demand from our customers.
We also closely monitor the regulation of cannabinoid products in the United States. To date, we have imported cannabinoid products from Colombia with both explicit import permits from the U.S. DEA for research purposes, and under the Farm Bill for product development purposes. However, evolving regulation surrounding the 2018 Farm Bill, by the FDA for CBD or around the legalization of broader cannabis use for medical or other purposes, may create the opportunity either for imports from Colombia and Portugal and/or the commercialization of cannabinoid products in the United States. In 2021, we exported our first commercial shipment of THC flower from Portugal to the United States.
Herbal Brands has conducted research and development on a variety of CBD products, and launched Joysol, its first consumer brand to include cannabinoids, to distribute through its existing distribution channels in January 2022.
Our Products
Our product portfolio is generally split into two primary categories: nutraceuticals and cannabinoids.
Nutraceuticals
Our nutraceutical products consist primarily of a variety of beverage and powder products, most of which we manufacture in our GMP-compliant, FDA registered production facility in Arizona. These products primarily include cleanses or other wellness products. We provide a limited amount of contract manufacturing for other nutraceutical companies that produce similar products.
Cannabinoids
The growth of our cannabinoid product portfolio is a significant focus area, and it emphasizes business to business solutions for our customers. We generally categorize our cannabinoid products as flower or extracts and offer both bulk raw materials (APIs) and finished products.
Flower
Our dried flower products are generally classified as either containing low levels of THC or high levels of THC.
Low-THC Flower. We currently cultivate low-THC flower (sometimes referred to as hemp) in Colombia. We are generally not subject to any limitations on the amount of low-THC flower that we can cultivate in Colombia. 
This product can be sold as dried and unprocessed flower, but it can also undergo various forms of processing, such as decarboxylation or milling, before sale. Packaging is typically suitable for large volumes of product, such as vacuum sealed pouches or other containers.
High-THC Flower. Our flower with high levels of THC is commonly referred to as cannabis and is often considered to be psychoactive. We currently cultivate cannabis in both Colombia and Portugal. In Colombia, we used to process our high THC flower into extract products for further distribution in Colombia and internationally. However, we are now preparing high THC flower for export in the near future. In Portugal, we cultivate cannabis for sale as a raw material for further processing, including extraction, and we plan to start processing this same cannabis as an API or finished product suitable for inhalation. In Germany, preliminary sales of IQANNA, our pharmaceutical cannabinoid branded flower, have commenced, IQANNA uses flower produced by us as well as flower produced by third parties.
In Germany, Cansativa imports and distributes flower and other products produced by third parties such as Aurora, Bedrocan, Canopy Growth and Tilray.
Extracts
By extracting and processing our flower produced in Colombia, we produce a variety of extracted products including isolates, crude oil extracts, standardized extracts, and oral solutions. Extracted products are often defined by their formulation, typically specifying the level of cannabinoids contained therein. We currently market more than 10 different formulations of extracted products, and we plan to gradually grow our portfolio of formulations over time. These products also vary by container type, such as a bulk glass or plastic containers, and by size, such as 10 or 30 milliliter bottles.
Similar to our flower products, our extracts are generally classified as containing either low or high levels of THC. The regulatory requirements applicable to each category of flower product are more stringent as the level of THC increases. Extracts with low levels of THC can generally be commercialized more readily without requiring as many approvals, such as quotas or import and export permits, while extracts with high levels of THC are classified and regulated as controlled substances and subject to more stringent regulatory requirements, including production quotas, import and export permits, and product specific certifications. These products are sold as wellness or pharmaceutical products.
Some of our customers have requested additional assistance with extracts, either in the form of extraction as a service or to assist with their own product development. We have engaged in these services on a limited basis. These ancillary services require substantial time and know-how, but we believe our ability to provide a broader array of business-to-business solutions can help strengthen our existing customer relationships.
Operational Overview
Genetics
In Colombia, plant varietals cannot be commercialized until they have been registered with ICA, the Colombian agricultural regulator. In Colombia, we have registered 35 genetic strains of cannabinoids and we are currently planning to increase this number. We are also partnering with third parties to use their strains as a tool to complement our current portfolio. We continue to optimize the use of these strains for our specific cultivation environment and have substantially increased our productivity as measured by weight per plant since our initial harvests.
In August 2020, we received a license from INFARMED to cultivate, import and export dried cannabis flower produced from our Portuguese cultivation site. To date in Portugal, we have imported 14 strains of cannabis for cultivation and we are currently in the process of importing additional strains.
Cultivation
Colombia
We believe we have one of the largest licensed productive capacity footprints to produce medical cannabis in Colombia with 18 greenhouses and 1.8 million square feet of cultivation space. With 6 million square feet of leased or owned land, our 
greenhouse cultivation can be expanded to approximately 2.5 million square feet at our existing operating site. We also have an option to acquire approximately 73 million additional square feet of agricultural land for open field cannabis production. Although we have built a limited amount of preliminary infrastructure on this expansion property and we have licensed it for cultivation activity, we are currently waiting to develop it pending future increases in customer demand. Due to the scale and novelty of the operation, we would need to construct additional infrastructure and develop new processes to manage the scale of biomass production at this operation.
Our Colombian cultivation operations benefit from the following certifications:
•In May 2020, some of our Colombian cultivation operations, representing approximately 100,000 square feet of propagation and nursery areas, approximately 400,000 square feet of our vegetative and flowering greenhouses, and approximately 20,000 square feet of our post-harvest and processing facility, were granted GACP certification by the Control Union Medical Cannabis Standard ("CUMCS"). This certification is recognized globally and certifies that our production complies with CUMCS’ guidelines for quality and consistency based on a review and approval of our trained personnel practices, use of qualified equipment, and documentation and approval procedures. In addition, the certification attests that we operate under procedures to produce crops free of heavy metals and agrochemicals, an important differentiator for our business because of the safety measures required for pharmaceutical manufacturing. We obtained the GACP certification for an additional 14 greenhouses in November 2020 thereby, completing the certification process for all 18 of our greenhouses in Colombia.
•In July 2020, we received our EU GMP certification from HALMED for our post-harvest facility on our cultivation site in Colombia. EU GMP certification is often an essential requirement for exporting medical cannabis for commercial and medicinal purposes to European countries, including but not limited to Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland and Portugal.
We have chosen to develop a significant portion of our cultivation operations in Colombia for the following reasons:
•Geographic conditions make Colombia well situated for cannabis cultivation. Its proximity to the equator provides approximately 12 hours of daily sunlight throughout the year. Its high-quality soil, water and warm weather provide favorable conditions for year-round cultivation without the expense of significant light supplementation;
•Within Colombia, our greenhouse cultivation operations are located at over 8,000 feet of elevation, which reduces the population of pests that can complicate agricultural operations;
•The Colombian agronomical conditions result in lower expansion costs compared to those of Canadian and U.S. competitors;
•The regulatory framework for cannabis and hemp operations is relatively well-established and was recently updated, providing more competitive advantages, in the context of a global highly regulatory-driven industry;
•Colombia has a lower cost of living, labor and construction compared to costs in the United States and Canada; and
•Due to the incumbent flower export industry in Colombia, export and logistics infrastructure is well established.
Portugal
Our European production operations are headquartered in Portugal where we have approximately 9 million square feet of agricultural and agro-industrial land and approximately 260,000 square feet of existing greenhouse facilities which are licensed to cultivate, import, and export cannabis. In 2021, we completed the construction of an EU GMP-compliant post-harvest facility. We intend to obtain EU GMP certification for our post-harvest processing activities. In February 2021, CUMCS granted our facilities in Portugal GAP certifications, under the CUMCS-GAP standards, which expired in February 2022 and is being updated to the IMC-GAP standards.
We believe Portugal is one of the most attractive European jurisdictions for cannabis cultivation due to its agricultural conditions, low operating costs compared to other European countries and access to high-quality facilities and talent. We selected our site within Portugal after conducting a nationwide agronomical study on cultivation conditions.
Extraction
Our Colombian extraction operations are conducted in approximately 44,000 square feet of pharmaceutical grade facilities with a fully equipped R&D laboratory. We currently lease three adjacent or nearby properties in the secured industrial park where our extraction operations are located.
Our Colombian extraction facility is capable of processing 104,400 kilograms of dry flower per year and is expandable to over 300,000 kilograms of dry flower per year with limited additional investment. Of the 104,400 annual kilograms of dry flower extraction potential, approximately 32,400 kilograms per year can be extracted in our EU GMP-certified operation. By extracting and processing our flower produced in Colombia, we produce a variety of extracted products including isolates, crude oil extracts, standardized extracts, and oral solutions. Extraction of cannabis and processing of concentrates for medical and scientific purposes in Colombia requires a license, which allows sale of such final products in the domestic Colombian market. We are one of the first companies in Colombia to have obtained the requisite extraction license.
In August 2019, our Colombian manufacturing facilities were granted Colombian GMP certification by INVIMA. We were the first Colombian cannabis company to receive Colombian GMP certification from INVIMA. This Colombian GMP certification allows the manufacture of pharmaceutical-grade products that can be prescribed through medical distribution channels.
In July 2020, our Colombian extraction facilities also received EU GMP certification from HALMED. Our EU GMP certification is distinctive in that it covers API, and semi-finished and finished cannabis products. EU GMP certification is often a required qualification for the European market, which adheres to strict pharmaceutical quality standards, and for other markets that accept EU GMP certification within their territories.
Research and Development
As part of our Colombian operations, we also have a quality control laboratory and fully equipped R&D laboratory, where we develop processes and formulations for safe and high efficacy products, develop ingredients and raw materials for new products, conduct stability tests on new products or formulations, and develop product master files or dossiers. We are developing extraction processes and methods to improve yields and efficiency as well as to create new product formats. We are also developing new products and formulations to improve efficacy or meet regulatory requirements in new markets. We have completed the construction and are operating a secondary research and development site in Portugal, with an initial focus on the strain development and stabilization.
Brands
Our largest brands in terms of revenue to date are those managed by Herbal Brands. We have also developed a pharmaceutical cannabis brand called IQANNA, which launched in Germany in late 2021.
Strategic Investments
We seek to partner with and invest in several value-add companies to develop and strengthen market access and global reach. In December 2018, we made an initial investment into Cansativa. Founded in 2017 and based in Frankfurt, Germany, Cansativa is a GMP-certified pharmaceutical company and holds a GDP pharmaceutical wholesale license to trade in controlled substances. Cansativa imports and distributes medical cannabis products throughout Germany. As of December 31, 2021, we held an approximately 14% ownership interest in Cansativa and one advisory board seat. In the first quarter of 2022 we signed an agreement to sell a portion of our investment in Cansativa, reducing our equity ownership to approximately 9%. See Note 22, to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in this Form 10-K for more information. Although we have yet to sell any products to or through Cansativa, we have a preferred supply relationship with Cansativa with respect to products sourced from Colombia. We anticipate that this investment could assist us with distributing our medical cannabis products and IQANNA pharmaceutical brand products throughout the German medical marketplace.
Regulatory Environment
We are committed to operating in compliance with applicable law, including U.S. federal and state laws, and have focused our activities in those countries that have legalized key aspects of the production, distribution, sale and use of cannabis and cannabis derivatives, including cannabinoids. However, the patchwork of federal and local legal frameworks governing our markets and related business activities are subject to change and have the potential to affect all areas of our business. We monitor the global regulatory landscape in order to ensure ongoing regulatory compliance in our relevant markets, and to identify and capitalize on new opportunities as they emerge around the world.
Regulatory Environment in Colombia
Cannabis-related activities are regulated in Colombia, under strict compliance with the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, to which Colombia is a signatory. Law 1787 of 2016 (the “Medical Cannabis Law”), which together with related regulations provide for the traceability of cannabis plants, the work-in-progress and resulting products and the specific activities of the licensed companies, specify the types of licenses, approvals and permits required for the respective activities, and establish various requirements applicable to the medical, veterinarian, industrial and wellness markets.
Adopted in 2016, the Medical Cannabis Law created a legal framework for the medical and scientific use of cannabis and its derivatives in Colombia and imposed the obligation on the Colombian government to create proper regulatory cannabis framework.
Licensing Requirements
In late July 2021, the Colombian government passed Decree 811, which replaced Decree 613. Decree 811 removed the prohibition contained in Decree 613, allowing the exportation of cannabis flowers. In February 2022, the Colombian government passed Regulation 227, which defines the procedures to begin cultivating cannabis for exporting the flower. An additional resolution defining the procedures for exporting is expected to be passed in the first half of 2022 by the Colombian government.
From a legal and regulatory perspective, there are two classes of cannabis plants which are categorized according to their THC content. A plant is considered psychoactive if it has a THC content of 1% or more on a dry weight basis. Non-psychoactive plants are those with less than 1% THC content on a dry weight basis.
A license is required for the cultivation of both psychoactive and non-psychoactive plants. Psychoactive plants also require the grant of a quota for their breeding, sowing and cultivation. The grant of a quota entails full traceability from the beginning stages of cultivation with mother plants, to the final destination of the derivative (which may be for exportation, local market or research), all of which are reported to and verified by the Narcotics National Fund (“Fondo Nacional de Estupefacientes - FNE”) and the Ministry of Justice. Non-psychoactive plants do not require quota for their sowing and cultivation.
Resolutions 577 and 579 of 2017 adopted by the Colombian Ministry of Justice provide for the requirements and the process for obtaining licenses to handle seeds or grow psychoactive and non-psychoactive cannabis, and contain provisions aimed at promoting and protecting small scale cultivators, stating that at least 10% of the raw materials used to manufacture psychoactive cannabis derivatives must come from small scale cultivators.
There are seven types of licenses issued with respect to activities relating to cannabis and cannabis derivatives for medical and scientific use:
•License to handle seeds, which covers the acquisition of seeds under any title, import, storage, marketing, distribution, possession, and final disposal, as well as their use, export and commercialization.
•License to grow psychoactive cannabis, which permits its cultivation, sowing, acquisition and production of seeds, storage, marketing, distribution, and final disposal, as well as use of cannabis plants with 1% THC content or more for medical and scientific purposes; medical use cannot be done with raw cannabis as it has to be transformed into extracts or medicines. Currently, exports of dried flower are only allowed for research purposes. Commercial exports are now permitted under new regulations contained in Decree 811, which was passed in July 2021 and Resolution 227, which was passed in February 2022. Resolution 227 defines the procedures to begin cultivating cannabis for exporting the flower. An additional resolution defining the procedures for exporting is expected to be passed in the first half of, by the Colombian government.
•License to grow non-psychoactive cannabis, which permits its cultivation, acquisition, and production of seeds; storage, marketing, distribution and final disposal of cannabis plants with less than 1% THC content in dry weight, as well as their use for medical, industrial and scientific purposes; medical use cannot be done with raw cannabis as it has to be transformed into extracts or medicines. Currently, exports of dried flower are only allowed for research purposes. Additional regulation is required to permit commercial exports.
•License to manufacture cannabis derivatives, which is required for the transformation of cannabis for medical and scientific purposes and covers the manufacture, acquisition under any title, import, export, storage, transport, marketing, and distribution of psychoactive and non-psychoactive cannabis derivatives.
•License to manufacture non-psychoactive derivatives (those with a TCH content of less than 1%), including CBD crystals.
•Extraordinary license for the cultivation of cannabis plants, granted on an as-needed basis with the option to run-out on hand inventory balances and for non-commercial investigation purposes.
•Extraordinary license for the manufacture of cannabis derivatives, granted on an as-needed basis with the option to run-out on hand inventory balances and for non-commercial investigation purposes.
Decree 811 also created a new modality of license for the manufacture of non-psychoactive derivatives, which does not require a quota so long as the derivative and product remain non-psychoactive (less than 1% THC).
Decree 811 sets forth the applicable requirements for each of the above-mentioned types of licenses.
We believe we have obtained the required licenses and quotas to perform our current activities.
Relevant Governmental Bodies
The regulation, oversight and enforcement of cannabis licenses are performed by several governmental bodies in Colombia, including the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, the Ministry of Justice and Law, the Ministry of Agriculture, FNE, INVIMA and ICA.
The Ministry of Justice is responsible for the evaluation of documents and the issuance of licenses to handle seeds, to grow psychoactive and non- psychoactive cannabis.
The ICA regulates the registration, protection and use of cannabis seeds and cannabis-based finished products for veterinary use, as well as the export and import processes.
INVIMA is responsible for the evaluation of documents and the issuance of the licenses to manufacture cannabis derivatives. In addition, INVIMA is responsible for the authorization of the cannabis-based finished products for human consumption or use, according to the following categories: (i) phytotherapeutics (herbal medicines), (ii) pharmaceutical products, (iii) cosmetics, and (iv) magistral formulae.
The FNE regulates all activities related to the commercialization of psychoactive raw material and finished products containing more than 0.2% of THC on a dry weight basis. Marketing of non-psychoactive raw material is not under the control regime and all products with 0.2% or less of THC are not considered a controlled substance.
Allocation of Quotas to Licensed Companies
Quotas for breeding, sowing and cultivating psychoactive plants are allocated by the Ministry of Justice, based on a pre-authorized or simultaneously approved manufacture quota which is granted by the FNE based on written commercial agreements or letters of intention with customers that reflect estimated sales for the next calendar year. Due to regulatory transition, Decree 613 still applies in connection with quotas, under which, the deadline for the ordinary quota application is April 30 of each year. Quotas are granted on a calendar-year basis. To apply for a quota an applicant must have the relevant licenses for psychoactive cannabis.
The quota system in Colombia allows for supplementary quotas, for new markets, product launches or research. Supplementary quotas will also be subject of a complete review and redesign with the pending regulation after Decree 811.
Quotas granted to private companies for local use are related to the cannabis estimates confirmed to Colombia each year by the INCB. Quotas for exports are no longer tied to the INCB confirmed national estimates for Colombia.
Current cannabis-related licenses in good standing were issued with a five-year term, and Decree 811 allows them to be extended for a 10-year period, subject to the licensee's formal petition and eventual formal requirements still to be defined in the regulation.
Cannabis Derivatives
The FNE regulates the disposal, import and export of controlled substances in Colombia, including, cannabis-controlled derivatives. All inventory movements of psychoactive derivatives must be reported to FNE in a timely manner and must be consistent with the quotas allocated to the respective cannabis producers.
In addition to the 1% THC limit for dry weight in the plant material, in March 2020, the Colombian government established a 0.2% THC threshold for cannabis-based finished products to be considered a controlled substance which is also applicable for imports and export of all cannabis and cannabis derived products. Finished products with less than 0.2% THC content are considered a non-controlled substance and are not subject to the above-mentioned requirements. Also, Decree 811 established that finished products with less than 1% THC can be certified as non-controlled for export purposes if they are declared non-controlled in the country of destination.
Decree 811 also creates a regulatory framework for the manufacture, sale and export of food and beverages and the export of flower from Colombia.
Export Permits
The export of controlled substances and products (including raw material, pharmaceutical products and phytotherapeutics) outside Colombia requires an export permit issued by the FNE. The FNE grants (i) non-control certifications for general exports of cannabis products below the 0.2% THC limit and for products below the 1% THC limit, if these products are considered non-controlled in the country of destination, and (ii) export permissions based on the corresponding import permission issued by the authority of the destination country.
Colombian GMP Certification
In September 2019, we received Colombian GMP certification for our Colombian facility to manufacture cannabis-based finished products for liquid-oral pharmaceutical dosage forms from INVIMA, which confirms that the products we manufacture are produced according to Colombian pharmaceutical quality standards.
European Union (EU) Regulatory Environment
Regulations regarding medical cannabis
There is no formal EU definition of “medical cannabis.” Medical cannabis can be described as whole-plant cannabis-derived products (generally cannabis flower or oils) that are licensed by member state health systems for prescription by a physician. As recognized by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, medical cannabis refers to a wide variety of preparations and products that may contain different active ingredients and use different routes of administration.
From a legal and regulatory perspective, there are two categories of medical cannabis products: cannabis-derived medicinal products and cannabis preparations for medical use.
•Cannabis-derived medicinal products are products which have been granted a marketing authorization from a regulatory authority (the European Medicines Agency at EU level or national competent authorities at EU member state level), after going through extensive clinical trials to test the products’ safety and effectiveness. These products are regulated as (cannabis-derived) “medicinal products” in accordance with the harmonized EU regulatory system set forth by EU Directive 2001/83/EC. To date, several cannabinoid-containing medicinal products have been authorized for marketing in the EU and certain EU member states, including, among others, plant-based products Sativex® (nabiximols) and Epidyolex® (CBD), and synthetic products Marinol® (dronabinol) and Cesamet® (nabilone). 
•Cannabis preparations for medical use are products which may be authorized through national distribution and use authorizations or licenses in certain EU member states. This group of products includes, among others, raw cannabis (such as the flowering tops, resin, and oils extracted from the plant). Alternatively, raw cannabis can be transformed by a pharmacist into a magistral preparation in accordance with a medical prescription, or the raw cannabis may already have been transformed by the manufacturer into standardized cannabis preparations. These cannabis preparations can vary greatly in composition, depending for example on the strain of cannabis, the growing conditions and how the preparations are stored.
Since the EU is not a party to the international conventions related to the control of drugs, the obligation to implement the requirements of said conventions sits with the individual EU member states. The regulation of medical cannabis falls largely within the competence of the EU member states, which may decide to permit the medical use of cannabis preparations (without requiring a marketing authorization in accordance with EU Directive 2001/83/EC) under specific conditions. Pursuant to Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC (which relates to so-called “named patient use” of medicinal products), the use of medical cannabis can only be authorized by member states upon medical prescription and when there is a medical need for the patient.
The regulations with respect to medical cannabis vary greatly amongst member states. While some EU member states have adopted specific legal provisions and frameworks governing the distribution and use of medical cannabis, including Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, Italy, Malta and Portugal, the status of medical cannabis in other member states remains unclear and is developing.
Regulations regarding CBD-containing products
CBD is a naturally occurring cannabinoid found in cannabis/hemp plants, which is not in itself considered as a narcotic or psychotropic substance under the International Conventions or the laws of some EU Member States, including Germany. The substance can be isolated as a pure compound, and in principle can be extracted from all parts of the plant, practically free from other cannabinoids (such as THC) and therefore free from any psychotropic or narcotic properties. The WHO considers that CBD is generally well tolerated with a good safety profile and does not exhibit effects indicative of any abuse or dependency potential.
Nevertheless, to date, the status of CBD, which can be included in different types of regulated products (e.g., cosmetics, food, etc.), remains unclear in the European Union. For example, CBD can be included as an ingredient for cosmetics, while the use of CBD in edibles is not yet included in the Novel Food Catalogue.
The following sections describe the legal and regulatory landscape in Germany and Portugal, the two the EU member states in which Clever Leaves conducts its main EU operations.
Germany Regulatory Landscape
Regulations regarding medical cannabis
The importation and distribution of medical cannabis in Germany is mainly covered by §3, 5, 7, and 11 of the German Narcotics Law or BtMG (Betäubungsmittelgesetz), §52a,72, and 73 of the German Medicines Act or AMG (Arzneimittelgesetz), and the German Narcotics Foreign Trade Ordinance or BtMAHV (Betäubungsmittel-Außenhandelsverordnung) as well as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961). The relevant competent authority is the Federal Opium Agency or Bundesopiumstelle (“BOPST”), a sub-unit of the BfArM, and the German Federal authorities.
Pursuant to sec. 1 (1) in conjunction with annex I BtMG, cannabis is a narcotic drug, subject to certain exceptions including seeds and cannabis with a tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content of less than 0.2%, which are not classified as narcotic drugs. It is a criminal offense in Germany to illicitly cultivate, produce and trade in cannabis or, without engaging in its trade, to import, export, transit, sell, supply, otherwise place it on the market or acquire or procure it in any other way.
The Act on the Amendment of Narcotic Drugs and Other Regulations (Gesetz zur Änderung betäubungsmittelrechtlicher und anderer Vorschriften) which came into force on March 10, 2017, introduced an exception to allow the prescription and trade of cannabis for medical purposes. Prior to March 2017, the import of cannabis was not permitted, and pharmacies could request medical cannabis from abroad for specific patients only in exceptional circumstances (upon medical prescription), subject to a special case-by-case approval issued by BfArM. Since March 2017, cannabis cultivated for medical purposes outside Germany can be imported and marketed in Germany by private companies provided they have obtained all relevant licenses that must be in line with the Single Convention.
Prescribing and Dispensing Regime
In Germany, the legal framework enables doctors to prescribe medical cannabis. Generally, medical cannabis is distributed in the form of medicinal cannabis flowers, as a cannabis extract, as a THC active single substance (dronabinol) or as a finished product. Pursuant to the German Narcotics Law, only pharmacies are permitted upon a narcotics prescription to supply cannabis to patients in the form of cannabis flowers, cannabis extracts (magistral preparations) or dronabinol or as finished products containing natural or synthetic cannabinoids. The exact recipe instructions for such magistral preparations are laid down in the New Prescription Form, which is the standard work for drug production in pharmacies and is part of the German Drug Codex.
Reimbursement Regime
Health insurance is statutorily mandated in Germany, and residents are covered by either statutory health insurance plans (covering approximately 90% of the population) or private health insurance. Prior to March 2017, only cannabis intended for the manufacture of finished medicinal products containing cannabis could be imported into Germany. Since March 10, 2017, medical cannabis can be prescribed at the expense of the statutory health insurance companies in Germany upon their prior approval.
Currently, the costs of medical cannabis can be covered by German health insurance. Insured persons with a serious disease are entitled to be supplied with cannabis in the form of dried flowers or extracts in standardized quality (and pharmaceuticals containing the active substances dronabinol or nabilone) if a generally recognized treatment in accordance with medical standards is not available or cannot be used in the individual case and there is a prospect of positive effect on the course of the disease or person’s symptoms according to Section 31 Paragraph 6 German Social Insurance Code (Fünftes Sozialgesetzbuch).
The new Law for More Safety in the Supply of Pharmaceuticals (Gesetz für mehr Sicherheit in der Arzneimittelversorgung) which became effective in August 2019 enables patients who have been granted an approval to switch smoothly between cannabis products without having to wait for a new approval.
Licensing Requirements
In order to import and distribute medical cannabis in Germany, a private company needs to secure a license for the Trade in Narcotic Drugs at the federal level from the Federal Opium Agency or BOPST, and a Wholesale Trading License from local health authorities (§§52a, 72, and 73 of AMG and §§3,5,7 and 11 of BtMG). In addition, if cannabis is imported, the company will also need an Import/manufacture License for pharmaceuticals issued by the relevant health authority. For each individual shipment of cannabis an import permit will be required after the Narcotics License is granted.
License for the Trade in Narcotic Drugs
A license for the Trade in Narcotic Drugs is required for all operations relating to the trading of narcotic drugs (such as cannabis), including, among others, cultivation, production, import and export. This license is issued by the Federal Opium Agency, a division of BfArM.
Import Authorization for Narcotics
An Import Authorization for narcotics issued by the Federal Opium Agency is required for each import of narcotics into Germany. An Import Authorization for narcotics can only be obtained by a company with business activities in Germany. The authorities have broad rights with respect to issuing Import Authorizations and may refuse to grant an Import Authorization or, in certain circumstances, restrict the quantity of the narcotics being imported.
An Import Authorization cannot be transferred to third parties and is limited to a maximum of three months (or six months for imports by sea). If the narcotics are not imported within this time frame, the import authorization must be returned to BfArM.
A company applying for a license for the Trade in Narcotic Drugs and an Import Authorization for narcotics must meet various requirements, including among other, an appointment of a responsible person with relevant expertise responsible for compliance with the regulations governing narcotics, compliance with applicable security measures and certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
Wholesale Trading License
Medical cannabis falls under the definition of a medicinal product, as defined in the German Medicines Act, and requires a Wholesale Trading License if a private company engages in wholesale trading of medical cannabis. Wholesale trading is defined broadly and includes any professional or commercial activity involving the procuring, storing, supplying or exporting of medicinal products, with the exception of the dispensing of medicinal products to consumers other than physicians, dentists, veterinarians or hospitals.
A company applying for an Import Authorization for narcotics with respect to the import of medical cannabis into Germany generally is also in possession of a Wholesale Trading License.
Other Licenses
A company importing medical cannabis from a third country (outside of EU) is required to have an import license for pharmaceuticals pursuant to Sec. 72 of the German Medicines Act.
If medical cannabis is treated with ionizing radiation (for example, cannabis products that are subject to electron, gamma or x-ray radiation to reduce the bacterial count) it may require a marketing authorization. In addition, a manufacturing license is required for the process, package, labeling and any other manufacturing step of cannabis as a medicinal product, including market release in Germany, according to §13 of AMG of the German Medicines Act.
EU GMP Certification
The guidelines on EU GMP describe the minimum standard that a pharmaceutical manufacturer must meet in its production processes according to European standards. Any pharmaceutical manufacturer wishing to import medicinal products into the EU must comply with EU GMP.
A prerequisite under EU GMP is that medicinal products are of consistently high quality, suitable for their intended use and meet the requirements of the marketing authorization or clinical trial authorization. For this reason, an EU GMP certification facilitates the movement of goods and contributes to the credibility of the product. In general, Article 51 of Commission Directive 2001/83/EC requires that each and every batch imported from an EU country outside the EU is checked to ensure that it complies with EU GMP standards. If a manufacturer in a non-EU country has an EU GMP certification for its medicinal product, this batch testing is not required pursuant to Article 51(2) of Commission Directive 2001/83/EC.
Under German law, the EU GMP guidelines must be complied with respect to medicinal products and active substances that are manufactured, tested, stored, placed on the market in Germany, brought into or out of the German territory, imported or exported.
In July 2020, Clever Leaves received an EU GMP certification from HALMED allowing Clever Leaves’ pharmaceutical post-harvest facility and laboratory located outside Bogota, Colombia, to produce API, semi-finished and finished cannabis products for medical purposes.
Regulations regarding CBD-containing products
In Germany, BfArM takes a view that CBD is currently not subject to the BtMG as a pure substance and is exempt from the narcotics regulations if it is produced from plants cultivated in countries of the European Union with certified seeds (hemp) or their THC content does not exceed 0.2% and certain other conditions are satisfied. This exemption from the BtMG also applies to preparations made from plants and parts of plants if they meet the above conditions.
While this position has not been officially confirmed by the German authorities with respect to cosmetics, in light of the applicable EU regulatory framework, the use of CBD isolate for commercial purposes — including use in cosmetics — may in principle be permitted in Germany provided the conditions listed above (including not exceeding 0.2% THC) are met. CBD products may be subject to additional restrictions (for example, concentration limits that must be met for the product to not be considered a medicinal product). 
Portugal Regulatory Environment
Cannabis legal framework
In Portugal, cannabis activities are regulated by sets of laws and regulations which were adopted over time, including:
•Decree-Law no. 15/93, dated January 22, 1993 (the “Narcotics Law”), which, among other matters, regulates cannabis substances and products as legally controlled psychotropic substances that are subject to licensing, for certain legally authorized purposes, and other restrictions, and creates the legal framework applicable to drug trafficking and consumption of the narcotic and psychotropic substances;
•Regulatory Decree no. 61/94, dated October 12, 1994, which implements the Narcotics Law;
•Law no. 33/2018, dated July 18, 2018 (the “Cannabis Law for Medicinal Purposes”), which establishes the legal framework for medicines, preparations and substances based on the cannabis plant for medicinal purposes;
•Decree-Law no. 8/2019, dated January 15, 2019, which implements the Cannabis Law for Medicinal Purposes; and
•Administrative Ordinance no. 44-A/2019, dated January 31, 2019, which regulates the pricing regime applicable to preparations and substances based on the cannabis plant for medicinal purposes.
Prior to the adoption of the Cannabis Law for Medicinal Purposes which is specific to medical cannabis, the Narcotics Law considered the cannabis products listed therein (leaves of cannabis sativa L., cannabis resin, cannabis oil obtained from cannabis sativa L. and seeds not intended for cannabis sativa L.) as legally controlled psychotropic substances that could be cultivated, processed manufactured or distributed in Portugal, subject to certain licensing rules and conditions.
Licenses required for, among others, the cultivation, production, manufacturing, trade, distribution, import, export, transit and transportation of cannabis are granted by INFARMED for exceptional uses primarily for medical, medical-veterinary and scientific and research purposes, and in compliance with strict regulatory requirements. Although the Narcotics Law technically allowed the cultivation, processing or transformation of cannabis for medical and research purposes, since 1993, when the Narcotics Law was adopted, until the adoption of the Cannabis Law for Medicinal Purposes, cannabis was mainly viewed as a narcotic and there was no formal medical cannabis program in Portugal.
Adopted in 2018, the Cannabis Law for Medical Purposes created a special legal framework for the use, prescription, research, sale and distribution of medicines, preparations and substances based on the cannabis plant. The Cannabis Law for Medical Purposes was specifically aimed at organizing a proper medical cannabis program, including the prescription by doctors and distribution by pharmacies of medicines, preparations and substances based on cannabis, as well as the research of its therapeutic components.
Both the Cannabis Law for Medical Purposes of 2018 and the Decree-Law no. 8/2019 that implemented it came to distinguish and define cannabis products in medicines (e.g., medicines based on preparations or substances derived from the cannabis plant), preparations (e.g., extracts, tinctures, oils) and substances (e.g., cannabis plants, or parts, whether whole, fragmented or cut).
The Decree-Law no. 8/2019 clarified that cannabis medicines require a Marketing Authorization and their preparations and substances require an Authorization for Placing on the Market (a specific registrations procedure) granted by INFARMED. The Decree-Law no. 8/2019 has also specified that cannabis activities for medical purposes are subject to licensing requirements that must comply with:
• Good Agricultural Collection Practice (GACP), for cultivation activities;
• Good Manufacturing Practice for Active Substances, for APIs’ manufacturing activities;
• Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), for medicines manufacturing activities; and
• Good Distribution Practice (GDP), for distribution of medicines and API.
In addition, Decree-Law no. 8/2019 provides that the prescription of medicines, preparations and substances based on the cannabis plant for medicinal purposes are only permitted in circumstances where conventional treatments with authorized medicines are determined to not produce the expected effects or to cause relevant adverse effects.
Pursuant to the Administrative Ordinance no. 44-A/2019, the pricing of cannabis preparations and substances is subject to approval by INFARMED. The holder of a Marketing Placing must propose and communicate to INFARMED the price it intends to charge for its cannabis preparations and substances. The proposed price must be accepted by INFARMED which has the power to object to it.
Medical cannabis: types of licenses
Cannabis is a controlled substance in Portugal, and INFARMED supervises any activities related to its cultivation, processing and manufacturing, distribution and import/exports. There are currently six different categories of licenses for activities related to medical cannabis: (1) cultivation, (2) manufacturing, (3) wholesale distribution, (4) import, (5) export, and (6) transit. Entities seeking to conduct any of the activities subject to licensing must submit an individual application to INFARMED, in which they must describe their economic and pharmaceutical project and specify its chain of suppliers and buyers. Failures to comply with the licensing regime or the license terms are subject to fines.
Clever Leaves Portugal, Unipessoal, Lda. (previously known as Northern Swan Portugal Unipessoal, Lda., “Clever Leaves Portugal”) was granted a license in 2020 from INFARMED to cultivate, import and export dried cannabis flower for commercial purposes.
Recreational use of cannabis
Recreational use of cannabis is currently not allowed in Portugal but is not criminalized.
Status of CBD-related products
Although the legal status of CBD products in Portugal raises questions in the legal community, CBD products are technically viewed as controlled substances and are subject to the restrictions and licensing requirements imposed by the Narcotics Law.
Regulatory Framework in the United States
While Clever Leaves owns a U.S. business that manufactures and distributes health and wellness products in the United States, neither Clever Leaves nor any of its subsidiaries currently engage in the cultivation, distribution, sale or possession of medical or adult use cannabis in the United States and, as such, are not required to obtain licenses related to such activities under any state law. However, we have imported cannabinoid products from Colombia through explicit import permits from the U.S DEA for testing purposes and under the Farm Bill for product development purposes. Herbal Brands has conducted research and development on variety of CBD products, and it launched JoySol, our first consumer brand to include cannabinoids, through its existing distribution channels in January 2022.
Legal status of cannabis, other than hemp
All but three of the 50 U.S. states have legalized cannabis for medical purposes to some extent, and eighteen of those states and the District of Columbia have also legalized cannabis for adults for non-medical purposes (sometimes referred to as recreational use.) Those cannabis activities, however, are illegal under U.S. federal law. The Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”) continues to list cannabis (marijuana, but not hemp) as a Schedule I controlled substance (i.e., deemed to have no medical value. Accordingly, the manufacture (growth), sale or possession of cannabis is federally illegal, even for personal medical purposes.
Although the U.S. government has not recently prosecuted any state law compliant cannabis entity, the risk of future enforcement cannot be dismissed entirely. Enforcement in the U.S. could slow the progress of global legalization, which could negatively impact cannabis businesses like ours even though we are not operating in the U.S. Any federal enforcement action could, in turn, negatively impact our business.
Legal status of hemp and hemp derivatives
Until December 2018, hemp (defined by the U.S. government as Cannabis sativa L. with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis) and hemp extracts were illegal Schedule I controlled substances under the CSA.
The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Pub.L. 115-334 (the “2018 Farm Bill”), removed hemp and extracts of hemp, including CBD, from the CSA schedules. Accordingly, the production, sale and possession of hemp or extracts of hemp, including CBD, no longer violate the CSA. The 2018 Farm Bill allows hemp cultivation and the transfer of hemp and hemp-derived products across U.S. state lines for commercial or other purposes.
Despite the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp products’ legal status is complicated further by other state and federal laws. The U.S. states are a patchwork of different laws with regard to hemp and its extracts, including CBD. Additionally, the FDA claims that the Food, Drugs & Cosmetics Act (the “FD&C Act”) significantly limits the legality of hemp-derived CBD products, especially for ingestibles.
It is the FDA’s position that “it’s unlawful under the FD&C Act to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products, as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived,” and regardless of whether health claims are made. This is because CBD (and THC) are active ingredients in FDA-approved drugs and became the subject of public substantial clinical investigations when GW Pharmaceuticals submitted investigational new drug (IND) applications for Sativex and Epidiolex, both containing CBD as an active ingredient. The FDA has also warned against health claims: prior to introduction into interstate commerce, any cannabis product, whether derived from hemp or otherwise, marketed with a disease claim (e.g., therapeutic benefit, disease prevention) must first be approved by the FDA for its intended use through one of the drug approval pathways. In determining “intended use,” the FDA has traditionally looked beyond a product’s label to statements made on websites, on social media or orally by the company’s representatives.
Certain CBD products are arguably federally legal today, notwithstanding the FDA’s position. To the extent that a CBD product is outside the FDA’s jurisdiction, the product is likely federally legal because CBD, unlike many drugs that the FDA regulates, is no longer listed on the FDA’s schedules. CBD products other than food, beverages and supplements which are not marketed drugs, and do not include health claims, may fall outside of the FDA’s authority. If so, some products that may be legal today include topical products, such as cosmetics, massage oils, lotions, and creams. Additionally, the FDA lacks authority, except in limited circumstances, to enforce claims against companies which sell CBD products provided that they do not engage in “interstate commerce.” However the definition of "interstate commerce" is amorphous and may include sources of ingredients, components, or even investments, that in some way impact more than one state.
Enforcement under the FD&C Act may be criminal or civil in nature may can include those who aid and abet a violation, or conspire to violate, the FD&C Act. Criminal violations of the FD&C Act are punishable by fines and imprisonment. Civil remedies under the FD&C Act may include civil money penalties, injunctions, and seizures. The FDA also has a number of administrative remedies (such as warning letters, recalls, and debarment.) With respect to CBD products, the FDA so far has limited its enforcement to sending cease and desist letters to companies which sell CBD products that make “egregious, over-the-line” claims, such as “cures cancer”, “treats Alzheimer’s Disease”, or “treats chronic pain.” 
The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has also sent warning letters to companies making unsubstantiated health claims about CBD products and has even filed a lawsuit against one. Neither the FDA nor the FTC has employed additional enforcement actions against companies selling CBD cosmetics without health claims. 
Joysol produces tinctures, creams, and gummy products containing CBD. We do not believe that our CBD products implicate any FDA and FTC enforcement priorities. However, it remains unclear what ultimate position the FDA may take with regards to CBD products, and its position could change substantially in a way that could negatively impact our business.
Regulatory Framework in Canada
Canada has federal legislation which uniformly governs the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis under the Cannabis Act (Canada). While Clever Leaves is incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, neither Clever Leaves nor any of its subsidiaries currently engage in the cultivation, distribution, sale or possession of cannabis in Canada and, as such, are not required to obtain licenses related to such activities under the Cannabis Act. We have previously received three import permits from Health Canada for the import of cannabis for testing purposes and are currently pursuing commercial import permits in compliance with the Cannabis Act.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to environmental legislation, including federal and provincial statutes and regulations and municipal by-laws, which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects, including the presence or migration of contaminants at or from our properties. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental laws and are not currently aware of any material environmental liabilities.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021 we had approximately 560 employees. Our workforce is diversified across multiple locations with 73%, 19%, and 8% of our employees located in South America, Europe and North America, respectively. We believe that our entrepreneurial, decentralized, and diversified work environment have contributed to our success. We also believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent on our ability to foster an environment that is sustainably safe, respectful, fair, and inclusive and promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion inside and outside of our business. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements, and we believe we have a good relationship with our employees.
