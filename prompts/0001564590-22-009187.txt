Overview
 We are a clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on the development and commercialization of novel integrated drug and delivery solutions for the localized treatment of patients with ear, nose, and throat, or ENT, diseases. Our proprietary technology platform, XTreo™, is designed to precisely and consistently deliver medicines directly to the affected tissue for sustained periods with a single administration. Our initial product candidates, LYR-210 and LYR-220, are bioresorbable polymeric matrices designed to be administered in a brief, non-invasive, in-office procedure and intended to deliver up to six months of continuous drug therapy to the sinonasal passages for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis, or CRS. The therapeutic embedded within LYR-210 and LYR-220 is mometasone furoate, or MF, which is the active ingredient in various U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved drugs and has a well-established efficacy and safety profile. CRS is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses which leads to debilitating symptoms and significant morbidities and affects approximately 14 million people in the United States. 
 We have advanced LYR-210 as a potential preferred alternative to surgery through a Phase 2 randomized, controlled, patient blinded clinical trial, which we refer to as our Phase 2 LANTERN clinical trial, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy in CRS patients both with and without nasal polyps who have failed previous medical management but have not undergone endoscopic sinus surgery, who we refer to as surgically-naïve CRS patients. The trial was designed to enroll 99 evaluable patients with the potential to increase to up to 150 patients and was initiated in May 2019 at sites in Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, New Zealand, and Poland. In December 2019, the FDA authorized our investigational new drug application, or IND, and, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we planned to enroll patients in the United States. However, in light of developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, we discontinued enrollment at 67 patients in our Phase 2 LANTERN clinical trial and did not enroll any patients in the United States. 
 On December 7, 2020, we reported positive top-line results from our Phase 2 LANTERN clinical trial, including that the 7,500 µg dose of LYR-210 achieved statistically significant improvement in the composite four cardinal symptoms score, or 4CSS, in favor of the treatment arm as measured by the change from baseline at weeks 16, 20, and 24. The four cardinal symptoms of CRS are nasal obstruction and congestion, facial pain and pressure, nasal discharge, and olfactory loss (loss of sense of smell). However, although a strong treatment effect was observed at week 4, LYR-210 did not achieve the primary endpoint of change from baseline in 4CSS at week 4 at either the 7,500 µg dose or 2,500 µg dose relative to the control group. We believe this was due primarily to the discontinuation of enrollment related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the decrease in the number of patients enrolled from planned (99 evaluable) to actually enrolled (67), a greater magnitude of change from baseline in 4CSS at week 4 and/or a smaller standard deviation associated with the change from baseline was required in order to achieve statistical significance for the primary endpoint at week 4. In addition, we observed that patients generally experienced significant and rapid, clinically meaningful and durable improvement in SinoNasal Outcome Test scores, or SNOT-22 scores, an established patient symptom severity scale. In particular, the improvement in SNOT-22 score of the 7,500 µg dose of LYR-210 at week 24 over the control group (-19.0) was over two times the minimal clinically important difference of -8.9. Significant results were observed at week 24 in other endpoints including rescue medication use and ethmoid opacification for the 7,500 µg dose. LYR-210 was observed to be safe and well-tolerated at all doses in the trial, and no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. The LANTERN Phase 2 manuscript won the Clinical Science Maurice Cottle Award at the 67th Annual Meeting of the American Rhinologic Society (ARS) held in October 2021. For more information on the top-line results from our Phase 2 LANTERN clinical trial, see “—LYR-210 for the Treatment of CRS—Overview of Clinical Development—Phase 2.”
 In addition, we initiated a separate characterization study in the United States to collect certain pharmacokinetic, or PK, data. The PK study was a 56-day open label, multi-center, U.S. study of the PK and safety of LYR-210 in adult subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis. The primary objective of the study was to establish the PK profile of LYR-210. The study enrolled 24 patients, half of whom received LYR-210 2,500 µg and the other half received LYR-210 7,500 µg. The study indicated that both doses were safe and well tolerated, with the mean maximum plasma concentration, or Cmax, observed with the 7,500 µg dose well below the Cmax established for FDA-approved formulations of mometasone furoate, or MF. MF blood plasma levels observed during the PK study support LYR-210’s ability to deliver consistent and steady dosing

over the entire treatment period. The PK study was selected as the top clinical abstract at the 67th Annual Meeting of the American Rhinologic Society (ARS) held in October 2021.
 In an open-label, multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial, we placed 40 LYR-210 matrices bilaterally in 20 patients at sites in New Zealand and Australia. LYR-210 met its primary safety endpoint in the Phase 1 trial, and we observed significant and rapid, clinically meaningful and durable improvement through week 25 in SNOT-22 scores. At week 24, improvement versus baseline was observed in 90% of patients in this Phase 1 trial, with similar activity observed across both polyp and non-polyp patients. Secondary findings from our Phase 1 clinical trial showed that LYR-210 demonstrated significant reduction of sinonasal Type 2 inflammation in surgically-naïve patients with CRS. We believe the reduction of Type 2 inflammation suggests a correlation with rhinologic symptom improvement in CRS and we believe the reduction could be a potential measure of LYR-210’s local anti-inflammatory effects at the site of inflammation in the sinonasal passages. 
 In June 2021, we had an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA where we discussed key elements of the Phase 3 program and gained alignment on our clinical development plan and trial endpoints going forward. We submitted our Phase 3 protocol to the FDA and continue to communicate with the FDA throughout the clinical development process as appropriate.
 Given the robust results seen for LYR-210 in the previous clinical trials, we have initiated the Phase 3 ENLIGHTEN program, consisting of two pivotal trials – ENLIGHTEN I and ENLIGHTEN II. ENLIGHTEN I is a 52-week, multi-center, randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LYR-210 in approximately 180 surgery-naïve CRS patients without nasal polyps or with polyps confined to the middle meatus and have failed prior medical management. The trial consists of three stages – a 2- to 4-week screening and run-in stage, a 24-week treatment stage followed by a 28-week safety extension stage. In the treatment stage, patients are randomized 2:1 to receive LYR-210 (7,500 µg) or sham-procedure. At the end of the treatment stage, patients in the control group receive crossover LYR-210 treatment while patients in the LYR-210 group are re-randomized 1:1 to either receive a crossover sham-procedure or a repeat treatment with LYR-210 (7,500 µg). The ENLIGHTEN I trial was initiated in January 2022. 
 ENLIGHTEN II is a 24-week, multi-center, randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LYR-210 in approximately 216 surgery-naïve CRS patients without nasal polyps or with polyps confined to the middle meatus and have failed prior medical management. The trial consists of two stages – a 2- to 4-week screening and run-in stage and a 24-week treatment stage. Patients are randomized 2:1 to receive LYR-210 (7,500 µg) or sham-procedure.  ENLIGHTEN II is expected to be initiated in the first half of 2022.
 The primary endpoint of both ENLIGHTEN I and ENLIGHTEN II is the change from baseline, or CFBL, at week 24 in the composite score of three cardinal symptoms, namely nasal congestion, facial pain/pressure, and nasal discharge, or 3CS. Secondary endpoints include CFBL in individual cardinal symptoms at week 24, CFBL in CT sinus opacification score at week 24, CFBL in SNOT-22 at week 24, and rescue treatment use through week 24.
 We are developing our second pipeline product candidate, LYR-220, for use in CRS patients who continue to require treatment to manage CRS symptoms despite having had sinus surgery. LYR-220 is also designed to utilize MF, but will employ a larger matrix designed for patients whose nasal cavity is enlarged due to sinus surgery. LYR-220 is designed as a potential preferred alternative to revision sinus surgery and post-surgical medical management. In November 2021, we initiated the Phase 2 BEACON clinical trial for LYR-220. The BEACON clinical trial will include sites in Australia and the U.S. and is a controlled, randomized, parallel-group study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy comparing two designs of LYR-220 to control over a 24-week period in approximately 70 symptomatic adult CRS subjects who have had a prior bilateral sinus surgery. The trial consists of two stages – stage 1 is designed to assess the feasibility of placement and procedural refinements in approximately 10 patients who will receive one of two designs of LYR-220; in stage 2, approximately 60 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either one of two designs of LYR-220 or sham procedure. The primary endpoint of the trial is incidence of product-related unexpected serious adverse events. Other safety endpoints include incidence of serious and non-serious adverse events, new or worsening of abnormal clinically significant findings in lab values, ophthalmology exams, and nasal endoscopies. Efficacy endpoints include change from baseline in the composite score of 3CS, SNOT-22 and other CRS symptoms, CFBL in ethmoid opacification by CT, and use of rescue treatments.
 Beyond CRS, we believe our XTreo platform has potential applications in other disease areas, which we are actively exploring to further broaden its therapeutic potential.

Our XTreo Platform 
 XTreo, our innovative and proprietary drug delivery platform, is designed to locally and continuously deliver small molecule drugs to the affected tissue over a sustained period of time from a single administration. The platform is comprised of three interrelated technology components: 

• | a biocompatible mesh scaffold, which is designed to maximize surface area for drug release while maintaining underlying tissue function;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an engineered elastomeric matrix, which means a polymeric matrix composed of polymers having elastic characteristics, which has advanced physical properties resulting in implants with “shape memory” that dynamically adapt to nasal anatomy; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a versatile polymer-drug complex, which can be customized for the treatment of various chronic diseases treatable with ENT delivery to achieve the desired drug dose and drug elution rate.

Chronic Rhinosinusitis: A Prevalent Disease with High Unmet Medical Needs 
 CRS is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses causing the soft, moist layer of mucus-producing tissue, or mucosa, that lines the sinuses to become swollen and inflamed, leading to significant patient morbidities. The inflammation may be caused by infections, allergies, or environmental factors, as well as structural issues such as blockages of an ostium. Patients with CRS on average experience a lower quality of life index than people suffering from congestive heart failure, angina, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or back pain. 
 CRS has been described in the literature as an “unrecognized epidemic” due to its high prevalence, its substantial impact on patient quality of life, and the significant limitations of currently available treatment options. We estimate that sinusitis, which includes both CRS and acute rhinosinusitis, impacts approximately 12% of the adult population in the United States, or approximately 30 million people, making it the fifth most common condition in people under the age of 65 and more prevalent than diabetes or heart disease. Of this population, we estimate that approximately 14 million people are affected with CRS. Moreover, we estimate that approximately 8 million people are treated for CRS by physicians annually, of which approximately 4 million fail medical management every year. In the United States, over $60 billion is spent annually in direct treatment costs for sinusitis, including approximately $5 billion on sinus surgeries.
 CRS is grouped into two phenotypes for regulatory purposes: CRS without nasal polyps and CRS with nasal polyps. The non-polyp form of CRS represents approximately 70%-to-90% of CRS patients. Currently there are no approved treatments for CRS patients without polyps. 
 Current Treatments and Their Limitations 
 The goals of therapy for CRS are to reduce mucosal swelling resulting from underlying inflammation, promote sinus drainage, and eradicate infections that may be present. The treatment of CRS is progressive in nature and typically begins with medical management, primarily with topical intranasal steroids and oral steroids. Topical intranasal steroids typically do not reach the epicenter of the disease deep in the sinuses, have fast clearance and poor compliance. The systemic complications of oral steroids limit their use. If this treatment is unsuccessful, an ENT physician may perform a sinus surgery. Sinus surgery is costly, does not address the underlying inflammation, and is invasive with significant post-operative pain.
 Currently, there are no FDA-approved drug therapies for CRS for non-polyp patients, although some drugs approved for nasal polyps are used off-label in this population.

Our Solution for CRS 
 LYR-210 is an anti-inflammatory implantable drug matrix based on our XTreo platform that is designed to consistently and locally elute MF to the inflamed mucosal tissue for up to six months in surgically-naïve CRS patients who fail medical management. MF, the active ingredient in various FDA-approved drugs, has a well-established efficacy and safety profile, which we believe will support the development process for LYR-210. LYR-210 is designed to enable sustained drug delivery at difficult-to-access nasal inflammation sites without the need for patient compliance, while avoiding the systemic side effects associated with oral steroids. LYR-210 is designed to be administered in a brief, non-invasive, in-office procedure by an ENT physician under endoscopic visualization via a single-use applicator. We are developing our second pipeline product candidate, LYR-220, for use in CRS patients who continue to require treatment to manage CRS symptoms despite having had sinus surgery. LYR-220 is also designed to utilize MF, but will employ a larger matrix designed for patients whose nasal cavity is enlarged due to sinus surgery. LYR-220 is designed as a potential preferred alternative to revision sinus surgery and post-surgical medical management.
 We believe that the key potential benefits of our current investigational product portfolio, LYR-210 and LYR-220, include: 
  
• | Clinical Activity: We believe LYR-210 and LYR-220 have the potential to significantly improve symptoms by maintaining a steady, high dose of MF at the site of inflammation for up to six months with a single administration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patient Compliance: Because drug delivery for LYR-210 and LYR-220 is designed to be sustained for up to six months with a single administration, the efficacy of LYR-210 and LYR-220 will not depend on patient compliance within the treatment period, unlike other CRS treatment options that require repeated daily administrations, such as topical intranasal steroids and oral steroids.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patient Experience: LYR-210 and LYR-220 are designed to be administered via a simple, in-office procedure every six months, which is intended to enhance convenience for patients, unlike the repeated daily medical management and/or time-consuming and painful surgery required by certain other CRS treatment options. Moreover, we believe patients may also benefit from the biocompatible, flexible structure of LYR-210 and LYR-220 that is designed to maximize comfort over the therapy period.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Physician Experience: LYR-210 and LYR-220 are designed to enable physicians to perform the placement of LYR-210 and LYR-220 in-office in conjunction with an endoscopy procedure, thereby making the placement aligned with the existing care continuum for CRS patients and eliminating the need for physicians to schedule separate surgical time. Moreover, the elastomeric matrix encapsulates the underlying mesh fibers to facilitate removal.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Localized Delivery: LYR-210 and LYR-220 are designed to benefit from our XTreo platform, which is intended to provide localized delivery to avoid systemic side effects that are common with certain other CRS treatment options, such as oral steroids.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patient Applicability: LYR-210 and LYR-220 are designed to treat the entire spectrum of CRS patients who have failed medical management, including pre- and post-surgical patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pharmacoeconomic Impact: LYR-210 and LYR-220 are designed as an alternative to surgery (initial or revision), and as such have the potential to provide significant savings to the healthcare industry by reducing the number and frequency of expensive surgical and biologic treatment options.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe LYR-210 and LYR-220, if approved, would be the only products able to deliver up to six months of continuous topical treatment in a single administration to treat the broad spectrum of CRS patients who fail medical management, including pre- and post-surgery patients.

Our Strategy 
 Our mission is to transform the ENT treatment paradigm by utilizing our proprietary drug delivery platform, XTreo, to develop safe and effective therapies for the treatment of debilitating diseases treatable with ENT delivery. We intend to achieve this through the following strategies: 

• | Complete the development and secure FDA approval of LYR-210 for the treatment of CRS. We believe LYR-210, if approved, is well positioned in the CRS treatment paradigm to provide a preferred alternative to surgery. LYR-210, which has advanced through our randomized, sham procedure-controlled, patient-blinded Phase 2 LANTERN clinical trial, utilizes MF, the active ingredient in various FDA-approved drugs. In January 2022, we initiated the Phase 3 ENLIGHTEN clinical program for LYR-210 and ultimately intend to seek marketing approval through a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted to the FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance our second product candidate, LYR-220, through clinical development to provide a comprehensive solution for CRS patients who have failed medical management and surgery. We are developing a larger version of LYR-210 designed for use in the enlarged nasal cavity of CRS patients who have had sinus surgery. We believe LYR-220, if successfully developed and approved, is well positioned to provide a preferred alternative to revision surgery and post-surgical medical management. In November 2021, we initiated the Phase 2 BEACON clinical trial for LYR-220.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a commercialization infrastructure in the U.S. market for LYR-210 and LYR-220. If any of our product candidates are approved, we plan to launch an efficient, go-to-market commercialization model focused on targeted outreach to our key physician, payor, and patient audiences.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the value of our XTreo platform and expand our product pipeline. Our XTreo platform provides a versatile drug development engine that enables us to focus on indications where long-term delivery of existing treatments may provide improved local bioavailability and enhanced efficacy or safety.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seek strategic collaborative relationships. We intend to develop our product candidates on our own in the U.S. and retain all U.S. rights, but may seek strategic collaborations ex-U.S., similar to our License and Collaboration Agreement with LianBio Inflammatory Limited, or the LianBio License Agreement., to facilitate the capital-efficient development of our product candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technology Platform 
 XTreo, our innovative and proprietary drug delivery platform is designed to locally and continuously deliver small molecule drugs to the affected tissue over a sustained period of time from a single administration. Our technology platform, developed over the past decade, was first patented in 2009 by members of our team who have extensive experience in drug formulation and delivery, materials science, and biotechnology. This expertise has allowed us to significantly improve upon polymer drug delivery technology and add shape-memory properties to bioresorbable polymeric implants, one of our key innovations.

Figure 1. XTreo Proprietary Platform. 
 XTreo, our drug-eluting bioresorbable technology platform is comprised of three polymeric components, which are designed to work together to enable highly efficient, localized drug delivery (see Figure 1, above). This proprietary technology platform is designed to enable sustained delivery of medications for many months of therapy, targeting tissues deep in the ENT passages and potentially other diseased tissues that are not accessible with conventional therapeutic approaches. The components of our platform include: 

• | Biocompatible Mesh Scaffold—our biocompatible mesh scaffold is intended to provide the foundation for efficient drug delivery. We have designed the mesh scaffold to optimize surface area for drug release while maintaining underlying tissue function through an open-cell design. The mesh scaffold is comprised of bioresorbable polymers and is pliable to maximize patient comfort.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engineered Elastomeric Matrix—over the last decade we have developed a highly sophisticated and proprietary engineered elastomeric matrix which has advanced physical properties to dynamically conform to nasal anatomy. Its adaptive elastic tension, which gives it shape-memory to resist deformation, is key to ensuring persistent positioning in the target location. The matrix works in conjunction with the underlying mesh to exert outward retention force, keeping it in place as tissue remodels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Versatile Polymer-Drug Complex—we have extensive drug-delivery know-how which has enabled us to design a versatile polymer-drug complex that can accommodate most small molecule drugs and achieve tunable elution profiles. We believe our versatile polymer-drug complex is potentially amenable to continuous, prolonged drug release across a wide range of drugs for different therapeutic applications. With proprietary bioresorbable polymer-drug formulations, we believe our platform can be used to customize controlled-release drugs for various chronic diseases treatable with ENT delivery and improve the efficacy of therapeutic properties of existing active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, through more prolonged delivery.

The three integrated components are fundamental to the successful function and versatility of the XTreo technology. For application to a targeted tissue, the implant is compressed into a narrow applicator, which allows non-invasive placement deep within cavities of the ear, nose, and throat. The shape-memory properties ensure the implant self-expands as it is administered through the applicator to comfortably fit within and adapt to the target anatomy. The implant is designed to be oversized for the target anatomy and therefore will push outwards to stay fixed at the target location. Over time, as inflammation recedes due to the local drug therapy, the shape-memory properties are intended to allow the implant to actively adapt to the anatomy and continue to stay in place to elute drug locally for a prolonged period. 
 Chronic Rhinosinusitis and the Treatment Landscape 
 Sinuses are air-filled pockets within the bones of the face and skull. The four types of sinuses are frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary (see Figure 2, below). One of each type of sinus lies on either side of the face. 
Figure 2. Illustration of Nasal Sinuses. 
 The sinuses are lined with a soft, moist layer of mucus-producing tissue, or mucosa. Mucus moistens the nasal lining and protects the body from inhaled impurities such as dust, pollutants, and bacteria. Each of the maxillary, sphenoid, and frontal sinuses has a corresponding ostium, or opening, through which mucus drains. The ethmoid sinuses are a series of cells with multiple, often interconnected openings and drainage pathways. The surface tissues of the sinuses are covered with millions of cilia, which are small, hair-like structures that act in coordination to sweep the mucus through the ostium of each sinus cavity to the back of the throat. The drainage of mucus is a normal process that keeps the sinuses healthy. 
 CRS is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinus causing the mucosa lining to become swollen and inflamed, leading to significant patient morbidities. The inflammation may be caused by infections, allergies, or environmental factors, as well as structural issues such as blockages of an ostium. If one or more sinus drainage pathways becomes blocked, normal mucus drainage is prevented and damage to ciliary function may occur. There are two categories of sinusitis: acute and chronic. Acute sinusitis is transient in nature and lasts less than four weeks. Chronic sinusitis is more severe and lasts 12 weeks or longer. The term “chronic sinusitis” is generally used interchangeably with “CRS” in the medical community, and we refer to the condition as CRS in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The four cardinal symptoms of CRS are nasal obstruction and congestion, facial pain and pressure, nasal discharge, and olfactory loss (loss of sense of smell). Other symptoms include chronic headaches, bodily pain, fatigue, sleep deprivation, depression, and recurrent infections. CRS may be diagnosed when two of the four cardinal symptoms persist for 12 weeks or longer and when inflammation is confirmed via endoscopy or CT scan. Patients with CRS experience a lower quality of life index than people suffering from congestive heart failure, angina, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or back pain. In addition, CRS symptoms are estimated to cause patients to miss over 11 million workdays per year in the United States alone, resulting over $1 billion in indirect economic costs. 
 We estimate that sinusitis impacts approximately 12% of the adult population in the United States, or approximately 30 million people, making it the fifth most common condition in people under the age of 65, and more prevalent than diabetes or heart disease. Beyond the United States, sinusitis has a similarly high prevalence in Europe, with approximately 27 million cases in the EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), and in Asia, with approximately 104 million cases in China alone. Of the approximately 30 million people impacted by sinusitis in the United States, we estimate approximately 14 million are affected with CRS. Of these, we estimate that approximately 8 million people are treated for CRS by physicians annually, of which approximately 4 million fail medical management every year.

CRS is grouped into two phenotypes for regulatory purposes: CRS without nasal polyps and CRS with nasal polyps. The non-polyp form of CRS represents approximately 70%-to-90% of CRS patients. Currently, there are no approved treatments for CRS without polyps, creating a vast untapped market opportunity for a more effective treatment solution.
Current treatments are directed towards managing the symptoms of CRS through a combination of medical management and surgical intervention techniques. The first line of therapy is medical management involving nasal saline irrigation, intranasal corticosteroidal sprays, oral steroids, and antibiotics for patients with an active sinus infection. CRS is the most common reason for adult outpatient antibiotic use in the United States. It has been estimated that antibiotic use to treat infections relating to CRS may cost more than $150 million per year in the aggregate. Patients whose symptoms persist despite medical management are generally recommended to undergo functional endoscopic sinus surgery (or FESS) or balloon sinus dilation (or BSD), or both. FESS is a highly invasive surgery performed in the operating room, under full anesthesia, to open the blocked sinus pathways by removing inflamed tissue and bone using surgical tools. BSD is a less severe form of endoscopic sinus surgery, often used in combination with FESS, in which small balloon catheters are inserted and inflated to drain the large nasal sinuses. Although FESS and BSD can improve symptoms and quality of life, limitations remain. Neither correct the underlying cause of the inflammation and patients who undergo either or both procedures often experience significant pain and require continued post-operative medical therapy to maintain improvements, with a high incidence of repeat surgeries. 
 Medical Management 
 The first-line of treatment for CRS is medical therapy, which typically includes nasal saline irrigation, corticosteroids, and antibiotics for patients with an active infection. 
 Steroids represent the current first-line standard of care for CRS patients, given they are generally pharmacologically effective at treating inflammation. Intranasal steroid sprays and aerosols, commonly indicated for rhinitis, or inflammation of the nasal passage, are routinely prescribed and used over-the-counter for the treatment of CRS symptoms. Physicians may also prescribe oral steroids on an episodic basis to patients who have not received sufficient symptomatic relief. They are generally prescribed for short-term use by patients with severe symptoms or exacerbations of CRS who are already on maintenance therapy, such as nasal irrigation or intranasal corticosteroid sprays. Finally, physicians may prescribe antibiotics for patients with an active infection. 
 Intranasal steroid sprays, oral steroids, and antibiotics each have significant limitations: 
  
• | While intranasal steroid sprays avoid systemic exposure and thus lack such serious side effects, penetration of the spray beyond the nasal cavities into the paranasal sinuses—the site of inflammation—is limited, particularly in pre-operative patients, despite requiring multiple, inconvenient administrations per day. In a published study, a large fraction of the spray was deposited in the anterior nasal cavity without any significant penetration into the paranasal sinuses. Additionally, intranasal spray efficacy is also limited due to fast clearance rates, as it has been demonstrated that mucocilliary action removes approximately 50% of the spray from the nasal cavity within 10 to 15 minutes of dosing. Poor patient compliance further limits the effectiveness of intranasal steroid sprays. While a recently launched intranasal exhalation delivery product has been developed to enhance the delivery of steroid to areas of inflammation within the sinus, the product is still subject to the limitations resulting from fast clearance and poor patient compliance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Oral steroid therapy is effective at reaching the sinus lining, but it does so by means of systemic exposure and therefore carries the risk of serious side effects associated with prolonged use, including glaucoma, bone loss, weight gain, psychosis, and difficulty in controlling blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes. Additionally, studies have shown that long-term benefits from their use are limited.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Although antibiotics are generally prescribed for patients with an active infection, their role for treatment of CRS is unclear, and there is limited evidence that supports their use for the treatment of CRS. In addition, their prolonged use can lead to antibiotic resistance, and CRS is identified as a major target in national efforts to reduce unnecessary antibiotic intervention.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Medical management is used as a first-line of medical therapy for pre-operative patients and as maintenance therapy for post-operative patients. Therefore, patients in both stages of the condition are managed medically and hence are subject to the limitations described above. Based on published medical literature, we estimate that at least 50% of CRS patients who are seen by ENT physicians and receive medical management remain symptomatic.

Sinus Surgery 
 The primary alternative after medical management is FESS, an invasive surgery during which a physician enlarges the inflamed and obstructed sinus pathways by removing inflamed tissue and bone in order to facilitate normal sinus drainage and aeration as well as provide greater access for delivery of steroids. First introduced in the United States in the 1980s, FESS is considered the standard of care for surgical intervention to treat CRS. However, while approximately 400,000 FESS procedures are performed each year, many CRS patients that have failed medical management opt not to have surgery given that it does not correct the underlying inflammation or obviate the need for medical management. Approximately 65% of patients have recurrent symptoms post-FESS and up to 20% require a revision surgery. 
 FESS is a highly invasive procedure, requiring general anesthesia and involving significant post-operative discomfort. During this procedure, a physician inserts an endoscope into the nasal cavity to provide visualization of the patient’s anatomy, the turbinate is identified with help of the endoscope and the uncinated process is removed exposing the ethmoid bulla. Surgical instruments, powered cutting tools, and balloon dilation devices are used to remove or dilate the obstructive tissue and bone. Given the essential role of the ethmoid bulla in sinus function, the ethmoid sinuses are then opened in 75%-to-85% of FESS procedures. The dependent sinuses each drain into the ethmoid sinuses through ostia, which may be enlarged by either surgically removing tissue or via balloon dilation. Following the surgical intervention, physicians often pack the newly opened ethmoid sinuses with gauze or other obstructive sinus packing materials to hold the sinus cavities open. A follow-up office visit is required several days after the procedure to remove the sinus packing materials and depending on the circumstances a patient may have to visit the surgeon two to three times a week for a period of time using nasal irrigation or will be allowed to carry out simple nasal douching several times a day. A typical FESS procedure costs approximately $14,000 on average. 
 Since the introduction of FESS, several new technologies, such as image-guided surgical navigation systems, powered surgical instruments, and BSD devices have expanded the addressable patient population who can benefit from FESS. For instance, BSD devices were developed to be used in combination with traditional surgical instruments during FESS to treat the dependent sinuses and have now allowed for treatment of some patients in the physician office setting as a standalone procedure. The cost of a BSD procedure can range from $3,000 to $7,000 per treatment. 
 On an annual basis, approximately 4 million CRS patients fail medical management, but ultimately only approximately 400,000 patients choose to undergo an endoscopic sinus surgery each year. Physicians report that many patients, when presented with sinus surgery as a treatment option, opt to forego the procedure. Some patients regard the often temporary benefits provided by surgery as not worth the expense, recovery time, or use of general anesthesia. 
 While sinus surgery is the standard of care for treating CRS after the failure of medical management, it has several significant limitations: 
  
• | Invasive surgery with significant post-operative pain and nasal care. FESS is an invasive surgery that results in irreversible changes to the anatomy and significant post-operative pain, discomfort, and recovery time. As with any invasive surgery, a FESS entails the potential for bleeding, infection, and scar tissue.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Requirement for post-operative maintenance. As the underlying inflammation of CRS is still unaddressed by sinus surgery, patients are required to post-operatively maintain their treatment with medical management. Additionally, reports have shown nasal polyp regrowth following surgery in many cases and post-nasal discharge often times remains a challenge.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Additional FESS procedures may be needed. Approximately 65% of patients have recurring symptoms post-FESS, and approximately 20% of patients will require a revision of sinus surgery within five years, 43% of whom will be within the first post-operative year. This is because sinus surgery does not cure the underlying cause of the inflammation of the sinus pathways, which can cause repeat flare ups. We believe the risk of potential revision surgery is a significant deterrent to some patients that would otherwise undergo sinus surgery.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for severe complications. As a result of the use of surgical tools in close proximity to the brain, eyes, and other critical anatomy, the potential for significant complications is a concern of physicians and patients alike. The risks of FESS, particularly in the frontal sinuses, cause some ENT physicians to avoid performing surgery in the frontal sinus drainage pathway. Major complications, such as cerebral spinal fluid leaks, swelling of the eye, or blindness, occur in approximately 0.3% of FESS procedures.

Drug Eluting Stents and Monoclonal Antibodies 
 For patients with nasal polyps who remain symptomatic following surgery, who we refer to as refractory patients, certain non-surgical options are available. A steroid-eluting stent which may deliver MF for 2-3 months was approved to treat adult patients with nasal polyps. In addition, three subcutaneously-administered monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, were recently approved as add-on maintenance therapy for uncontrolled disease in adults with nasal polyps. 
 However, each of these treatments has limitations. The drug-eluting stent has only a short elution profile, presenting a more burdensome treatment regimen and requiring patient compliance. Meanwhile, the mAbs are generally reserved for the most refractory patients, given their systemic nature, unknown long-term safety and significant price premium even when compared to surgical options. In addition, both of these treatment modalities are only approved for the treatment of nasal polyps, leaving non-polyp patients (who represent approximately 70%-to-90% of all CRS patients) who are refractory with no approved treatment options. 
 LYR-210 for the Treatment of CRS 
 We believe LYR-210, if successfully developed and approved, has the potential to become a preferred alternative to surgery for the treatment of CRS. It is the only product candidate that we are aware of that is designed to provide up to six months of local delivery of anti-inflammatory medication with a single administration. The brief, non-invasive, in-office procedure allows for its implantation without the need for surgery. Further, we believe our studies have shown that LYR-210 has the potential to be an effective treatment for both patients with and without polyps. We believe LYR-210 has the potential to be a safe, effective, and broadly applicable CRS treatment, designed to enhance patient comfort and physician experience and eliminate patient compliance issues associated with other CRS treatments, such as intranasal steroid sprays, while achieving reduced costs compared to other CRS treatments, such as sinus surgery. 
 

Figure 3. Illustration of Placement of LYR-210 in Middle Meatus. 
 LYR-210 is an investigational local drug delivery system designed to fit within, and conform to, the confined space of a surgically-naïve patient’s middle meatus, an air-containing space that plays a fundamental role in drainage of the paranasal sinuses (see Figure 3, above). LYR-210 consists of MF, the active ingredient in various FDA-approved drugs, embedded in biocompatible polymers to aid in the controlled and sustained delivery of MF to the sinonasal mucosal tissue from a single drug administration. LYR-210 has a tubular braid configuration with a uniform diamond pattern throughout and is 13 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length in the unconstrained state. It has elastic properties to promote patient comfort and is designed to be self-retaining against the mucosal tissue to allow effective drug transfer. 
 11


LYR-210 is intended to be administered bilaterally into the non-operated middle meatus by an ENT physician under endoscopic visualization via a provided, single use applicator. It is designed for office-based administration performed with topical anesthesia. Once administered, LYR-210 is designed to gradually release MF to the inflamed mucosal tissue for up to six months from a single administration. LYR-210 can be removed at six months or earlier at the physician’s discretion using standard instruments and, if needed, replaced with a new LYR-210. LYR-210 is made with bioresorbable polymers that, if left in place, would gradually dissolve over time.

Phase 3
 The LYR-210 Phase 3 program consists of two pivotal trials – ENLIGHTEN I and ENLIGHTEN II. ENLIGHTEN I is a 52-week, multi-center, randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LYR-210 in approximately 180 surgery-naïve CRS patients without nasal polyps or with polyps confined to the middle meatus and have failed prior medical management. The trial consists of three stages – a 2- to 4-week screening and run-in stage, a 24-week treatment stage followed by a 28-week safety extension stage. In the treatment stage, patients are randomized 2:1 to receive LYR-210 (7,500 µg) or sham-procedure.  At the end of the treatment stage, patients in the control group receive crossover LYR-210 treatment while patients in the LYR-210 group are re-randomized 1:1 to either receive a crossover sham-procedure or a repeat treatment with LYR-210 (7,500 µg). The ENLIGHTEN I trial was initiated in January 2022. 
 ENLIGHTEN II is a 24-week, multi-center, randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LYR-210 in approximately 216 surgery-naïve CRS patients without nasal polyps or with polyps confined to the middle meatus and have failed prior medical management. The trial consists of two stages – a 2- to 4-week screening and run-in stage and a 24-week treatment stage. Patients are randomized 2:1 to receive LYR-210 (7,500 µg) or sham-procedure.  ENLIGHTEN II is expected to be initiated in the first half of 2022.
 The primary endpoint of both ENLIGHTEN I and ENLIGHTEN II is CFBL at week 24 in the 3CS score. Secondary endpoints include CFBL in individual cardinal symptoms at week 24, CFBL in CT sinus opacification score at week 24, CFBL in SNOT-22 at week 24, rescue treatment use through week 24.
 Phase 2 
 Our Phase 2 LANTERN clinical trial for LYR-210 was initiated in May 2019. The clinical trial was designed as a multi-center, randomized, controlled, patient blinded trial. The study was designed to enroll 99 evaluable patients with the option to expand to up to 150 patients at up to 30 sites in the United States, Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, New Zealand, and Poland. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we discontinued enrollment at 67 patients and did not open any sites in the United States. 
Figure 4. Design of Phase 2 LANTERN Clinical Trial for LYR-210. 
 The trial consisted of three arms with a 1:1:1 randomization: (1) an experimental arm with bilateral placement of 2,500 µg of LYR-210, with 23 patients; (2) an experimental arm with bilateral placement of 7,500 µg of LYR-210, with 21 patients; and (3) a control arm with a bilateral sham procedure only, with 23 patients (see Figure 4, above). In addition, subjects were supplied with saline for daily nasal irrigation treatment during the course of the treatment period and were permitted to use rescue medication if deemed medically necessary by their physician. 
 The primary endpoint of the trial was a change from baseline in the 7-day average scores of the 4CSS at week 4. Because the FDA prefers a composite score of the cardinal symptoms of CRS for patients with CRS, we utilized the 4CSS for the trial. The 4CSS is comprised of four domains that are scored 0-3 with a total score of 12. The four domains are: (1) nasal obstruction and congestion; (2) facial pain and pressure; (3) nasal discharge; and (4) olfactory loss (loss of sense of smell). 
 14


The key secondary endpoints for the trial were the change from baseline in 7-day average 4CSS at week 24, time to treatment failure, and percentage of subjects with at least 1-point decrease in the bilateral Zinreich score (a measure of inflammation) in at least 1 pair of the anterior ethmoid, maxillary, posterior ethmoid, frontal, or sphenoid sinuses at Week 24. 
 On December 7, 2020, we reported positive top-line results from our Phase 2 LANTERN clinical trial. In our readout of top-line results, we reported that, at the 7,500 µg dose, LYR-210 achieved statistically significant improvement in 4CSS in favor of the treatment arm as measured by the change from baseline at week 16 (-1.47) (p=0.021), week 20 (-1.61) (p=0.012), and week 24 (-1.64) (p=0.016) (see Figure 5, below). However, although a strong treatment effect was observed at week 4, LYR-210 did not achieve the primary endpoint of change from baseline in 4CSS at week 4 at either the 7,500 µg dose (-0.36) (p=0.306) or 2,500 µg dose (0.04) (p=0.525). We believe this was due primarily to the discontinuation of enrollment related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the decrease in the number of patients enrolled from planned (99 evaluable) to actually enrolled (67), a greater magnitude of change from baseline in 4CSS at week 4 and/or a smaller standard deviation associated with the change from baseline at week 4 was required in order to achieve statistical significance for the primary endpoint. 
 

Figure 5. Total Symptom Improvement by 4CSS for Phase 2 LANTERN Clinical Trial. 
 Furthermore, the 7,500 µg dose of LYR-210 achieved statistically significant improvement in SNOT-22 score in favor of the treatment arm as measured by the change from baseline at week 8 (-12.2) (p=0.039), week 16 (-15.0) (p=0.008), week 20 (-18.4) (p=0.001), and week 24 (-19.0) (p=0.001) (see Figure 6, below). In particular, the improvement of the 7,500 µg dose of LYR-210 at week 24 over the control group (-19.0) was over two times the minimal clinically important difference of -8.9.

Figure 6. Total Symptom Improvement by SNOT-22 for Phase 2 LANTERN Clinical Trial. 
 LYR-210 was observed to be safe and well-tolerated at all doses in the trial. There was one serious adverse event, which was deemed to be unrelated to LYR-210. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. Treatment-related adverse events included epistaxis, rhinitis, rhinorrhea, and headache. All treatment-related adverse events were generally mild to moderate in nature, other than one incident of increased viscosity of upper respiratory secretion in the 2,500 µg dose treatment arm, and in line with the known safety profile of MF. 
 After 24 weeks, LYR-210 drug matrices were removed, and patients then underwent a 24-week post-treatment follow-up. The main objective of the post-treatment period was to assess long-term safety post-removal. LYR-210 continued to show strong safety through 24 weeks post-treatment with no increased incidence of treatment-related AEs. Approximately 50% of patients experienced a durable response post-removal of LYR-210 (7,500μg), with no worsening of 4CS scores from the Week 24 baseline, compared to approximately 90% of control patients who either experienced a worsening of 4CS scores from the Week 24 baseline or required a rescue treatment.
 In addition, because of developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, we discontinued enrollment at 67 patients in our Phase 2 LANTERN clinical trial and did not enroll any patients in the United States as planned. The LANTERN Phase 2 manuscript won the Clinical Science Maurice Cottle Award at the 67th Annual Meeting of the American Rhinologic Society (ARS) held in October 2021.
 Pharmacokinetic characterization study
 The PK study was a 56-day open label, multi-center, U.S. study of the PK and safety of LYR-210 in adult subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis. The primary objective of the study was to establish the PK profile of LYR-210 (see Figure 7, below). The study enrolled 24 patients, half of whom received LYR-210 2,500 µg and the other half received LYR-210 7,500 µg. The study indicated that both doses were safe and well tolerated, with the mean maximum plasma concentration, or Cmax, observed with the 7,500 µg dose well below the Cmax established for FDA-approved formulations of mometasone furoate, or MF. MF blood plasma levels observed during the PK study support LYR-210’s ability to deliver consistent and steady dosing over the entire treatment period. The PK study was selected as the top clinical abstract at the 67th Annual Meeting of the American Rhinologic Society (ARS) held in October 2021.

 Phase 1
 Our Phase 1 clinical trial for LYR-210 was a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm, open-label clinical trial with adult surgically-naïve CRS patients who have failed medical management. The objective of the trial was to evaluate safety and feasibility over 24 weeks of continuous anti-inflammatory treatment with a single administration of LYR-210 with an additional measurement taken one week post-removal. The trial was conducted across five sites in New Zealand and Australia. Forty LYR-210 matrices were placed bilaterally in 20 patients with and without nasal polyps. Each matrix contained 2,500 µg of MF. LYR-210 met its primary safety endpoint, and significant and rapid, clinically meaningful and durable improvement on a patient symptom severity scale was observed through 25 weeks. 
 The Phase 1 trial achieved its primary safety endpoint at week 4. LYR-210 at 2,500 µg was well tolerated by patients during the entire duration of treatment and also gave insight into the successful office-based placement of the matrix and clinical outcomes in non-polyp and polyp patients. There were no reports of unexpected adverse events, or AEs, or local nasal AEs, including epistaxis, nasal burning, nasal dryness, nasal irritation, and nasal septal perforation during the 24-week MF local dosing treatment duration. Additionally, no change in morning serum cortisol levels or intraocular pressures were noted. 
 The most common reported AEs were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, nasal odor, procedural headache, nasal discomfort, and facial pain. There was one serious adverse event, an acute myocardial infarction, which was deemed to be unrelated to LYR-210.
 Significant reduction in SNOT-22 scores was observed at week 1 and this reduction persisted through week 25, the end of the trial. 
 Similar efficacy was observed in both polyp and non-polyp patients. 
 LYR-220 for the Treatment of CRS 
 LYR-220 is a new investigative therapy for CRS patients with and without nasal polyps that have failed medical management and have had a prior endoscopic sinus surgery. In the treatment paradigm, LYR-220, if approved, is positioned for use for patients post-surgical intervention who continue to have recurrent CRS symptoms or relapse, as a potential preferred alternative to revision surgery. LYR-220 utilizes the same API as LYR-210, but with a larger matrix to treat larger nasal cavities consistent with those in post-surgical CRS patients. We estimate that 40% of patients that present to an ENT physician with CRS have had a prior surgery. These patients represent the addressable market for LYR-220. 
 17


No product is currently approved by the FDA to treat post-surgery CRS patients that do not have polyps, representing the vast majority of such CRS patients. A three-month steroid-eluting sinus implant was approved by the FDA to treat CRS in adults with nasal polyps and three subcutaneously-administered mAbs were recently approved as add-on maintenance therapy for uncontrolled disease in adults with nasal polyps. We believe LYR-220 is meaningfully differentiated from currently approved products because, if successfully developed and approved, it would be the only product able to deliver up to six months of topical treatment in a single administration to treat both polyp and non-polyp post-surgery CRS patients who fail medical management. Further, with respect to the mAbs, LYR-220 is differentiated because it would provide localized delivery so as to avoid systemic side effects with the added benefit of being a significantly more economical treatment alternative. 
 In November 2021, we initiated the Phase 2 BEACON clinical trial for LYR-220 which is a controlled, randomized, parallel-group study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy comparing two designs of LYR-220 to control over a 24-week period in approximately 70 symptomatic adult CRS subjects who have had a prior bilateral sinus surgery. The trial consists of two stages – stage 1 is designed to assess the feasibility of placement and procedural refinements in approximately 10 patients who will receive one of two designs of LYR-220; in stage 2, approximately 60 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either one of two designs of LYR-220 or sham procedure. The primary endpoint of the trial is incidence of product-related unexpected serious adverse events. Other safety endpoints include incidence of serious and non-serious adverse events, new or worsening of abnormal clinically significant findings in lab values, ophthalmology exams, and nasal endoscopies. Efficacy endpoints include change from baseline in 3CS, SNOT-22 and other CRS symptoms, CFBL in ethmoid opacification by CT, and use of rescue treatments.
 Early Stage and Future Product Candidates 
 Our XTreo platform provides a versatile drug development engine that enables us to focus on indications where long-term delivery of existing treatments may provide improved local bioavailability and enhanced efficacy or safety. In addition to CRS, LYR-210 may have the potential to address the significant unmet need for conditions where local long-term delivery can provide a clinical advantage. 
Post-Approval Commercialization Strategy 
 If LYR-210 and LYR-220 are successfully developed and approved, we intend to engage in targeted outreach to our key physician, payor, and patient audiences. ENT physicians are the primary treaters of CRS patients who have failed medical management and thus represent our target physician base. Given the requirement for endoscopic placement of our products, we plan to build a targeted in-house sales force that will target ENT physicians who perform 80% of the CRS procedural volume. Given that LYR-210 and LYR-220 can be administered in a brief, simple procedure requiring no additional equipment, we anticipate that our sales representatives’ time will primarily be directed at educating the ENT physicians around product attributes and patient selection. We plan to supplement our direct physician outreach with appropriate medical education and marketing efforts to further penetrate our physician base and drive adoption of our products. 
 Ensuring physician and patient market access to our products will be critical to our success, and we plan to execute a holistic reimbursement strategy, consisting of a reimbursement support hub and field-based reimbursement experts, that will integrate payor coverage and physician practice management initiatives. We believe that the primary decision makers from a payor perspective are private payors, which represent approximately 80% of the payor mix for our products. We intend to deploy a market access team to educate payors on the clinical and pharmacoeconomic attributes of our products and to seek to secure favorable coverage policies and to maximize the covered lives that have reimbursement for our products. To maximize access to LYR-210 and LYR-220, we plan to develop a reimbursement support model which aims to reduce physician financial risk associated with physician-administered products. 
 Subsequent to our initial ENT physician and payor efforts, we also plan to selectively use cost-effective, patient-directed marketing strategies to further increase awareness among the CRS patient community of our products with the goal of increasing ENT physician visits.

On May 31, 2021, we entered into the LianBio License Agreement to develop and commercialize LYR-210 in Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau), South Korea, Singapore and Thailand. Under the terms of the LianBio License Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $12.0 million and are eligible to receive up to $135.0 million in future payments based upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercialization milestones. Upon commercialization on a region-by-region basis, we will be entitled to receive low double-digit royalties based on net sales of LYR-210 in the licensed territories. LianBio will be responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of LYR-210 in the licensed territories, and we will retain all rights to LYR-210 in all other geographies. As part of the LianBio License Agreement, LianBio will also have the first right to obtain development and commercial rights in the licensed territories to our LYR-220 product candidate.
 In addition, we may also consider entering into additional collaborative relationships with established entities outside the U.S. for a potentially faster path to bringing our products to market. 
 Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change as research provides a deeper understanding of the pathology of diseases and new technologies and treatments are developed. We believe our scientific knowledge, technology, and development capabilities provide us with substantial competitive advantages, but we face potential competition from multiple sources, including large pharmaceutical, biotechnology, specialty pharmaceutical, and, to a lesser degree, medical device companies. 
 Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, robust drug pipelines, established presence in the market, and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement, and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified clinical, regulatory, scientific, sales, marketing, and management personnel, in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 LYR-210 and LYR-220 are positioned following the failure of medical management and therefore are not anticipated to compete directly with branded, generic, or over-the-counter inhaled corticosteroids. LYR-210 is positioned for use in surgically-naïve CRS patients where the primary competitive treatment is surgical procedures, including FESS with and without BSD and BSD as a standalone procedure. In this space, LYR-210 would be the only product we are aware of that may deliver six months of local treatment with a single administration for both patients with and without polyps as a preferred alternative to surgical interventions. LYR-220 is positioned for use in patients that have had a prior FESS. Currently there are no competitive treatments for post-surgical patients without polyps. For patients with polyps, LYR-220 would compete against steroid-releasing sinus implants and mAbs. We believe LYR-220 has competitive advantages over these interventions, including a longer elution profile than the existing sinus implant and no systemic exposure relative to the mAb. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of both LYR-210 and LYR-220 and any other product candidates we may develop are likely to be efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of administration, price, and reimbursement. 
 Sanofi/Regeneron and Optinose are also currently seeking to expand indications of existing products to include treatments of CRS in patients without nasal polyps. If these indications are approved by the FDA, they could represent competition for non-polyp patients. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We currently manufacture our drug delivery products at our facility in Watertown, Massachusetts with components supplied by external suppliers. This facility enables us to produce clinical trial material for early to mid-stage studies. We perform inspections of these components before use in our manufacturing operations. Using these components, we manufacture, assemble, inspect, and package our implants, and send them to a third-party sterilization vendor. After sterilization, we inspect the product and test via third-party laboratories to determine compliance with our specifications. Upon release of the lot to inventory, the product is labeled and distributed via a third-party vendor to clinical sites. 
 19


The API and a number of the components used in our implants are currently supplied to us from single source suppliers. We source our supplies from manufacturers with a track record of compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. We rely on single source suppliers for some of our polymer materials, some extrusions, and molded components, and for finished goods testing, labeling, and distribution. Our ability to supply our products and to develop our product candidates depends, in part, on our ability to obtain successfully the API and polymer materials used in these products in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities. We plan to enter into manufacturing, supply, and quality agreements with our single source suppliers. We generally acquire our single source components pursuant to purchase orders placed in the ordinary course of business. We currently maintain sufficient supplies of the API and components from our single source suppliers to support our ongoing development activities. In the future, we intend to maintain sufficient supplies such that our ability to supply the clinic or commercial market will not be compromised and so as to allow for sufficient time necessary to obtain another source of API or components. 
 We are currently improving our manufacturing capabilities and increasing capacity to support larger scale clinical studies and commercialization. We have completed technology transfer to a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, and are currently working with the CMO to scale-up its manufacturing capacity to support our late-stage clinical trials and support commercial product requirements, if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval. The CMO has the appropriate quality systems and infrastructure required to support clinical trials and commercial manufacture of our product candidates. We plan to continue to use an outsourcing model for our operations for the foreseeable future. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology platform that we believe is important to our business, which includes seeking and maintaining patents covering our technology platform and products, and any other inventions that are commercially or strategically important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand, and we seek to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
Patents and Patent Applications 
 As of December 31, 2021, we own 24 issued U.S. patents, 13 foreign issued patents, two PCT pending applications, 11 U.S. pending applications, and 23 foreign pending applications, out of which 17 issued U.S. patents, 13 foreign issued patents, 11 U.S. pending applications, and 23 foreign pending applications are directed to our XTreo platform, LYR-210, and LYR-220. 
 All technology material to our business has been developed in-house and is protected with patents and patent applications in two major lineages, along with the beginning of a third, more recent lineage of patent applications. The first lineage dates from 2009 and provides protection potentially until 2030, exclusive of possible patent term adjustments or extensions or other forms of exclusivity. This first lineage includes issued patents in the U.S., Europe, Japan, Canada, and Great Britain that are not limited to any particular drug, site of delivery, or patient condition, but specify features of the implant, system, method, and polymers. The second lineage dates from 2015 and provides protection potentially until 2036, exclusive of possible patent term adjustments or extensions or other forms of exclusivity. This second lineage includes issued U.S. patents with ENT-specific method claims directed to the specific drug, site of delivery (i.e. middle meatus), and patient condition, along with numerous pending applications in the U.S., Europe, Japan, Canada, China, and the Great Britain. The third, more recent lineage dates from 2017 with the prospect of patent protection potentially until 2037, exclusive of possible patent term adjustments or extensions or other forms of exclusivity. This third lineage attempts to capture the drug release features and patient results from the recent clinical trial. It includes pending applications in the U.S. and Great Britain, along with a patent application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty that entered the National Phase in October of 2019 in the following countries: the U.S., Canada, Australia, Europe, Korea, Singapore, China, and Japan.
 Trademarks and Trade Secrets 
 As of December 31, 2021, our trademark portfolio contained eight foreign trademark registrations and one pending U.S. trademark application.
 20


We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technologies innovation, and may pursue licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements, and non-solicitation and non-compete agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants, and others who may have access to proprietary information. 
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local levels, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import, and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. We will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and other countries, as appropriate, along with subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and resources. 
U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, which regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees; and
--+--------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 21


We are developing our product candidates using an innovative drug delivery platform comprised of a mesh scaffold, an elastomeric matrix, and a polymer-drug complex delivered through a narrow applicator. In the United States, products composed of components that would normally be regulated by different centers at the FDA are known as combination products. Typically, the FDA’s Office of Combination Products assigns a combination product to a specific Agency Center as the lead reviewer. The FDA determines which Center will lead a product’s review based upon the product’s primary mode of action. Depending on the type of combination product, its approval, clearance, or licensure may usually be obtained through the submission of a single marketing application. We anticipate that LYR-210 and LYR-220 will be regulated as drugs, and for each product candidate, the FDA will permit a single regulatory submission seeking approval. However, the FDA sometimes will require separate marketing applications for individual constituent parts of the combination product which may require additional time, effort, and information. Even when a single marketing application is required for a combination product, such as an NDA for a combination pharmaceutical and device product, both the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health may participate in the review. An applicant will also need to discuss with the Agency how to apply certain premarket requirements and post-marketing regulatory requirements, including conduct of clinical trials, adverse event reporting, and cGMPs, to their combination product. 
 Preclinical Studies 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective and a clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin 30 days after the FDA receives the IND, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


 
• | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may conditionally approve an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Marketing Approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of 10 months to review and act on a standard NDA and 6 months to review and act on a priority NDA, measured from the “filing” date for an NDA for a new molecular entity, or NME, or from the receipt date for an NDA for a non-NME product. Measuring from the “filing” date typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision because the FDA has sixty days from receipt to make a “filing” decision, as described below. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality, and purity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates, and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 23


Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 The FDA generally accepts data from foreign clinical trials in support of an NDA if the trials were conducted under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA nevertheless may accept the data in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if deemed necessary. Although the FDA generally requests that marketing applications be supported by some data from domestic clinical studies, the FDA may accept foreign data as the sole basis for marketing approval if (1) the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, (2) the studies were performed by clinical investigators with recognized competence, and (3) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection or, if the FDA considers the inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. 
 The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. 
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical testing, preclinical testing, manufacturing, or formulation modifications or other changes in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments 
 Our current regulatory strategy is to pursue development of LYR-210 as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of drugs previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This type of application permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on an FDA finding of safety, effectiveness, or both for an approved drug product. As such, under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA may rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. Therefore, if we can satisfy the conditions required for a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submission, it may eliminate the need for us to conduct some of the preclinical studies or clinical trials for the new product candidate that might otherwise have been required, although the review time is not shortened. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for the new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 24


Orange Book Listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug, to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the date on which such patent expires, or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The fourth certification described above is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. This section viii statement does not require notice to the patent holder or NDA owner. There might also be no relevant patent certification. 
 If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. Even if the 45 days expire, a patent infringement lawsuit can be brought and could delay market entry, but it would not extend the FDA-related 30-month stay of approval. 
 The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired. Specifically, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of an NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification. This exclusivity period may be extended by an additional six months if certain requirements are met to qualify the product for pediatric exclusivity, including the receipt of a written request from the FDA that the NDA holder conduct certain pediatric studies, the submission of study reports from such studies to the FDA after receipt of the written request, and satisfaction of the conditions specified in the written request. 
 Expedited Review and Approval Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track Designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 To be eligible for a Fast Track Designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 25


The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track Designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
 Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. 
 Post Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and other government authorities, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual program fee requirements for any marketed products. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state authorities, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 26


Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. 
 Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications. The FDA and other authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 Other Healthcare and Data Privacy and Security Laws 
 Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations, as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales, and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers, and entities; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and local laws governing the privacy and security of health-related and other personal information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligation, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and individual imprisonment.

Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufactures to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. 
 In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged and examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available, or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.

Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case, although it is unclear when or how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts to challenge, repeal, or replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, absent additional congressional action. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
