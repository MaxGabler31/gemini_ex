ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative, disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases cause a progressive loss of structure and function in the brain, leaving patients with devastating damage to their nervous system and widespread functional impairment. Although treatments may help relieve some of the physical or mental symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases, few of the currently available therapies slow or stop the continued loss of neurons, resulting in a critical unmet need. We are specifically focused on developing novel therapies to treat devastating conditions, either with large or orphan disease markets, such as Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, or MSA, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease), and frontotemporal lobar dementia, or FTLD.
Neurodegenerative diseases exert a heavy societal burden worldwide and represent one of the largest global healthcare challenges of our time. With an increasingly aging population, diseases affecting the brain and central nervous system are rising in prevalence, with overwhelming personal and economic consequences that exact a toll on patients, caregivers and treatment providers. The rising prevalence of neurodegenerative disease and a lack of disease-modifying treatments has resulted in a significant and growing unmet medical need. It is estimated that more than 60 million people worldwide suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, which is expected to almost double every 20 years. Global costs for treating these diseases are greater than $1 trillion annually.
 In February 2022, we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value and engaged H.C. Wainwright as our exclusive financial advisor to assist in this process. No timetable has been established for the completion of this process, and we do not expect to disclose developments unless and until the Board of Directors has concluded that disclosure is appropriate or required.
In February we also began implementation of a strategic restructuring with the objective of preserving capital. As part of the restructuring, we are eliminating approximately 60% of its workforce and took other actions, including reducing our office and laboratory space, to reduce expenditures.
 Our lead program, YTX-7739, is in development for the potential treatment and disease modification of Parkinson’s disease. YTX-7739 targets an enzyme known as stearoyl-CoA desaturase, or SCD. Inhibition of SCD in multiple cellular systems, including patient-derived neurons, as well as in a novel mouse model of Parkinson’s disease, has been demonstrated to reverse the toxicity of misfolded alpha-synuclein, or α-synuclein, a protein strongly associated with Parkinson’s disease.
In January 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), placed a partial clinical hold on multidose clinical trials of YTX-7739. The partial clinical hold suspends initiation of multiple dose clinical trials in the U.S. until the FDA’s concerns have been addressed. We anticipate working closely with the FDA to adequately address their concerns. The FDA’s action has not impacted our on-going multidose clinical trial in Europe and is permitting our planned single dose formulation clinical trial to proceed.
 
On November 10, 2021, we announced the top-line results of a Phase 1b clinical trial of YTX-7739 in patients with mild-to-moderate Parkinson’s disease, which assessed the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of YTX-7739. The Phase 1b clinical trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multi dose study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of YTX-7739. Data were reported from 20 patients with mild-to-moderate Parkinson’s disease. Patients received once-daily oral doses of YTX-7739 (20 mg or placebo) for 28 days. YTX-7739 was shown to inhibit its primary target, SCD, an enzyme whose inhibition has been closely linked to neuronal survival and improved motor function in a Parkinson’s disease model.
 
After 28 days of treatment, the 20 mg dose given once-daily reduced the fatty acid desaturation index (FA-DI), a biomarker of SCD inhibition, by approximately 20%-40%, the range expected to be clinically relevant based on preclinical studies. Target engagement in the cerebrospinal fluid suggested that YTX-7739 crossed the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, the PK/PD profile of YTX-7739 was consistent with previous studies and we believe informs dose selection for future studies.

YTX-7739 was generally well tolerated with all treatment emergent adverse events being mild to moderate in severity. There were no serious adverse events. Moderate adverse events (AEs) in the active treatment group consisted of 2 patients with increased Parkinson’s symptoms, 2 patients with lower back pain, 1 patient with headache, 1 patient with myalgia, 1 patient with insomnia, 1 patient with

ligament strain, and 1 patient with vaccination complication. One patient on placebo had moderate worsening of tremors and Parkinsonism, which led to discontinuation. AEs occurring at a higher percentage in 2 or more patients administered YTX-7739 compared to placebo were procedural pain, myalgia, dry eye, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoesthesia, lower back pain, and constipation. AEs occurring at a higher percentage with placebo included orthostatic hypotension, headache, tremor, fatigue and dizziness.

As expected, after only 28 days of dosing, there were no statistically significant differences in clinical assessments (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS III), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) or most exploratory biomarkers. Quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) assessments of the effect of YTX-7739 on brain activity were completed in a subset of 8 patients and demonstrated a statistically significant change compared to baseline, suggestive of a potential improvement in synaptic function.
 At the center of our scientific foundation is our drug discovery engine, which is based on technology licensed from the Whitehead Institute, an affiliate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This core technology, combined with investments and advancements by us, is designed to enable rapid screening to identify product candidates with the potential to modify disease by overcoming toxicity in disease-causing gene networks. Toxicity in many neurodegenerative diseases results from an aberrant accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain. We leverage our proprietary discovery engine to identify and screen novel drug targets and drug molecules for their ability to protect nerve cells from toxicity arising from misfolded proteins. To date, we have identified over twenty targets, most of which have not previously been linked to neurodegenerative diseases.
In the second quarter of 2020, we secured a strategic research and development collaboration in ALS and FTLD with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., or Merck, with upfront and potential milestone payments of up to $530 million plus royalties.
Neurodegenerative Disease Market and Challenges
Many factors, including too few disease-relevant biological hypotheses, the inherent complexity of the brain, and high patient heterogeneity, have led to a graveyard of failed approaches over the last several decades and have produced few approved disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative diseases to date.
We believe this is about to change. Recent scientific and technological advances include the improved understanding of the disease-relevant biology, innovative target discovery technologies, potentially better predictive animal models, new imaging approaches and identification of new biomarkers. These advances have ignited a renewed focus and commitment to neurodegenerative disease research and development, and we are one of the companies at the forefront of this emerging revolution.
Clinical study of neurodegenerative disease and evaluation of potential therapeutics has faced several hurdles. A primary consideration is the genetic heterogeneity of neurodegenerative diseases and subsequent variations in the disease biology in patients with similar clinical diagnoses. We believe this degree of heterogeneity is far greater than previously appreciated and is likely due to a unique combination of genetic and environmental factors which have important implications for development of therapies and their appropriate use by individual patients. We believe there is a need for a larger and more accurate set of biomarkers to aid in diagnosis as well as monitoring disease progression and treatment response in trials. Damage to brain cells early in the disease course and prior to the onset of symptoms presents further challenges for the design of clinical trials, as patients enrolling in clinical trials are typically selected based on expression of disease symptoms when significant damage to brain cells has already occurred. For example, increasingly sophisticated imaging studies have demonstrated that patients have lost at least 40% to 60% of dopaminergic neuronal integrity before qualifying for a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, indicating damage to brain cells begins long, often decades, before clinical symptoms manifest. As a result, many previous clinical trials in neurodegenerative disease included patients at a stage of the disease beyond which progression could no longer be modified. Thus, clinical trials would optimally be performed in patient populations that are at an early enough stage where potential disease-modifying therapies have an opportunity to preserve existing brain cells and function. Approaches to early diagnosis remain a focus in the neurodegenerative clinical research field.
In Parkinson’s disease, the cornerstone of pharmacological therapy for the past several decades has focused on either temporarily replenishing dopamine or mimicking the action of dopamine such as with the dopamine precursor levodopa. Levodopa, which is very helpful to patients in managing some of the motor symptoms of the disease, does not alter disease progression. Certain disease-modifying molecules are currently being investigated in early clinical trials for the potential of removing or reducing levels of α-synuclein. These programs, however, are predominantly focused on the development of antibodies. Therapeutic antibodies are large molecules that are administered systemically, and as such have significant challenges crossing the blood brain barrier and penetrating into the brain, which is the target tissue for neurodegenerative diseases. Even if some limited amount of antibody can penetrate into the brain, antibodies face a further challenge. α-Synuclein functions within cells to facilitate vesicle trafficking, however when α-synuclein misfolds it is thought to have an increased propensity to aggregate and disrupt multiple critical processes inside the cell. The ultimate expression of this pathology is the formation of Lewy bodies within neurons, which are a hallmark of dystrophic and degenerating cells. Therapeutics that target pathological processes within cells would be expected to prevent this toxic progression. α-Synuclein can also be secreted by neurons, and although the function is unclear, this results in α-synuclein outside of cells. It is this

population that would be a target for antibody therapeutics which are generally believed to interact with protein extracellularly, or outside the cell. We believe antibodies therefore have less access to α-synuclein, and recently, two antibody drug candidates that target α-synuclein failed to meet primary clinical endpoints in Phase 2 trials. By contrast, we are developing small molecules that our yeast platform pre-selects by design to cross the blood brain barrier and diffuse into the cell where α-synuclein causes cellular toxicity and damage. YTX-7739 targets the enzyme SCD, the inhibition of which has been shown to help overcome the toxicity of α-synuclein and promote protection of neurons.
Our Approach
Our approach is to unlock the path to new therapies by addressing the fundamental and persistent barriers in neurodegeneration research: the poor understanding of disease mechanisms and lack of new biological targets. We believe that programs focused on novel drug targets, which are grounded in an improved understanding of disease biology, will enable a higher likelihood of success in developing disease-modifying therapies.
Our discovery engine is built upon core enabling technology that we exclusively license from the Whitehead Institute, an affiliate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The core discovery technologies were created in the laboratory of our co-founder, Dr. Susan Lindquist. Dr. Lindquist and senior scientists from her team integrated multiple technology platforms to create a drug discovery engine designed to reliably generate new insights into fundamental mechanisms of neurodegenerative disease, and also reveal new potential drug targets and drug molecules that address neurodegeneration in a range of different ways, many of which were previously unknown.
The discovery engine is centered on the key insight that protein misfolding, a phenomenon at the root of virtually all neurodegenerative diseases, can be modeled in yeast cells. These yeast models are then screened against large chemical libraries using high throughput technology, selecting for chemical hits that protect cells from the toxicities created by the misfolded human disease-relevant proteins. The biological targets and pathways for these protective molecules are then uncovered using a series of chemical genetic techniques. Our technology also allows for screening yeast collections that have individual genes deleted, such that, when rescue is observed, it can be inferred that the gene that was deleted in that yeast strain is involved in ameliorating the toxicity of the misfolded human disease-relevant protein. Since the only modification to the original yeast system was the introduction of the culprit misfolding proteins, any molecule or gene deletion that can protect cells from the resultant toxicity is of interest. The discovery of protective molecules and biological targets, especially when previously unknown, can reveal new or untapped areas for study. We believe that the complement and overlap between the small molecule and genetic rescue screens have the potential to create a powerful network of interlinked biological processes that can further identify previously unknown therapeutic targets. We explore these cell-protective discoveries from the yeast system for translation to human disease-relevant cells using informatics and cutting-edge stem cell and iPSC experimental techniques. The discovery engine is designed to ultimately output novel programs: molecules with novel biological targets that can then be progressed through the standard preclinical drug development processes.
We believe our proprietary discovery engine has the potential to dramatically expand the knowledge around the complex biology of neurodegeneration, and further allows initiation of discovery programs outside of the traditional, limited set of hypotheses that exist today. Screening for hits in a living yeast system can save time by providing a biological-relevant readout sooner than some of the more typical practice of starting in non-live, test tube systems. Additionally, shared features between yeast cell membranes and the blood brain barrier, such as comparable membrane permeability, polarity, and drug pumps for removal of non-native compounds, mean that molecules that can permeate a yeast cell to effect intracellular rescue may also be likely to penetrate the blood brain barrier. Furthermore, our molecules have been tested in diseased human cells ex-vivo at the beginning rather than at the end of preclinical development. We believe that success in this setting confers increased confidence in programs compared to the more traditional paradigm of multiple rounds of animal studies before any actual testing in human tissues.
Key Differentiators of Our Discovery Engine
   
We have leveraged the power of our discovery engine to generate a robust portfolio of promising novel drug targets and molecules. We then prioritize the most promising targets to accelerate drug discovery programs and advance compounds into preclinical and ultimately clinical development. To date, this approach has already uncovered over twenty novel targets, pathways, mechanisms, and molecules that we believe have the potential to ameliorate the fundamental cellular toxicities associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
Discovered targets may mature into programs as they advance through the discovery process. YTX-7739, our lead program, targets the enzyme SCD, one of the early targets identified and validated in our discovery engine and is being studied for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. We are also developing lead compounds and validating two targets that are advancing through a research collaboration with Merck. Other targets for multiple potential indications are at varying stages of the discovery process.
Our Pipeline
All of our therapeutic candidates are small molecules and are optimized and formulated for oral delivery. We own both development and commercialization rights to YTX-7739 and all other targets except for our research collaboration with Merck, who has licensed these potential programs and will conduct IND-enabling toxicology and safety pharmacology, clinical development, and commercialization.
YTX-7739 is a novel small molecule for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and related disorders of α-synuclein. The program that resulted in this lead compound was the first prioritized output program of our discovery engine. YTX-7739 is designed to ameliorate the consequences of α-synuclein toxicity in human cells that results in cellular dysfunction, specifically disruptions with the directed movement, or trafficking, of proteins or lipid-bound vesicles within cells. YTX-7739 targets the enzyme SCD, that catalyzes a reaction in the lipid metabolism pathway.
α-Synuclein is a protein that is a prominent constituent of Lewy bodies, the abnormal protein aggregates that are the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, MSA and other neurological disorders known collectively as “synucleinopathies”. Current treatments for Parkinson’s disease manage the early motor symptoms of the disease. The goal of our differentiated and potentially disease-modifying approach with YTX-7739 is to block the intracellular toxicity associated with α-synuclein misfolding and aggregation to allow the cell to continue to function normally, and to slow or possibly even halt the progressive degenerative consequences of the disease.
On November 10, 2021, we announced the top-line results from our Phase 1b clinical trial of YTX-7739 in patients with mild-to-moderate Parkinson’s disease. The Phase 1b clinical trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multi dose study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of YTX-7739. Data were reported from 20 patients with mild-to-moderate Parkinson’s disease. Patients received once-daily oral doses of YTX-7739 (20 mg or placebo) for 28 days. YTX-7739 was shown to inhibit its primary target, SCD, an enzyme whose inhibition has been closely linked to neuronal survival and improved motor function in a Parkinson’s disease model.
After 28 days of treatment, the 20 mg dose given once-daily reduced the fatty acid desaturation index (FA-DI), a biomarker of SCD inhibition, by approximately 20%-40%, the range expected to be clinically relevant based on preclinical studies. Target engagement in

the cerebrospinal fluid suggested that YTX-7739 crossed the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, the PK/PD profile of YTX-7739 was consistent with previous studies and we believe informs dose selection for future studies.

YTX-7739 was generally well tolerated with all treatment emergent adverse events being mild to moderate in severity. There were no serious adverse events. Moderate AEs in the active treatment group consisted of 2 patients with increased Parkinson’s symptoms, 2 patients with lower back pain, 1 patient with headache, 1 patient with myalgia, 1 patient with insomnia, 1 patient with ligament strain, and 1 patient with vaccination complication. One patient on placebo had moderate worsening of tremors and Parkinsonism, which led to discontinuation. AEs occurring at a higher percentage in 2 or more patients administered YTX-7739 compared to placebo were procedural pain, myalgia, dry eye, hyperbilirubinemia, hypesthesia, lower back pain, and constipation. AEs occurring at a higher percentage with placebo included orthostatic hypotension, headache, tremor, fatigue and dizziness.

As expected, after only 28 days of dosing, there were no statistically significant differences in clinical assessments (UPDRS III, MoCA) or most exploratory biomarkers. Additionally, qEEG assessments of the effect of YTX-7739 on brain activity were completed in a subset of 8 patients and demonstrated a statistically significant change compared to baseline, suggestive of a potential improvement in synaptic function. We plan to further validate the role of this diagnostic marker in future clinical studies.

In January 2022, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a partial clinical hold on multidose clinical trials of YTX-7739. The partial clinical hold suspends initiation of multiple dose clinical trials in the U.S. until the FDA’s questions have been addressed. The FDA has not halted all clinical programming and is permitting our planned single dose clinical trial to proceed. We anticipates working closely with the FDA to adequately address their concerns. While we work to address the FDA’s concerns, we have paused our planned window-of-opportunity clinical study of YTX-7739 in glioblastoma multiforme patients and exploration of additional indications.

Two other programs are novel targets for the treatment of ALS and FTLD. Activities for these potential programs are currently being conducted through a research collaboration with Merck, with up to $530 million in potential milestones for us plus royalties. If these potential programs are successful and achieve full target validation with small molecule agents, they will advance to IND-enabling safety pharmacology and toxicology studies to be conducted by Merck, who will also be responsible for any subsequent clinical development and commercialization.
Beyond these programs, we have additional targets that constitute a rich discovery pipeline.

Our Discovery Engine Platform
Overview – Protein Misfolding and Toxicity Cascades
DNA is the foundational code for all proteins. The information held in DNA, in our genes, is transcribed first into RNA and then translated into linear strands of amino acids, the building blocks of all proteins found within cells. The linear strands of amino acids then fold in very precise, highly complex ways to form proteins, each having defined shapes and structures that enable them to carry out their normal biological function. When protein folding goes awry, critical functions of proteins may be lost, or new, abnormal functions may be gained.

Protein misfolding plays a key role in the initiation and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, MSA, ALS and FTLD. In each of these diseases, as culprit proteins misfold, they form aggregates that may combine into plaques, which form sticky deposits in the brain cells or in brain tissue. These aggregates and plaques can interfere with normal cellular function in a number of ways. For example, they may interfere with the directed movement, or trafficking, of proteins or lipid-bound vesicles within cells, or they may trigger inflammatory reactions. They may also impede chemical and enzymatic processes. Ultimately, these aggregates and plaques result in nerve cell damage and cell death.
A revolution in genetics over the past 15 years has led to the identification of genetic risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases and a number of genes that can be causally tied to protein misfolding processes. Patients who inherit mutations in a single, specific gene generally present with early-onset and aggressive forms of disease. Genetic data have enabled the development of animal and cellular pathology models based on overexpression of disease-causing genes. While undoubtedly an important advance, these models often do not replicate the full features of disease pathology. As a result, there is no conclusive demonstration to date that simply reducing the levels of misfolded proteins reduces the neurodegenerative pathology or presents an efficacious therapeutic approach to the treatment of neurodegenerative disease in humans.
Protein aggregate formation occurs in different places. In Alzheimer’s disease, protein aggregates are found in extracellular plaques, but in diseases like Parkinson’s disease and ALS, misfolded proteins tend to aggregate and create toxic effects inside of brain cells. These intracellular protein aggregates are protected by a cell membrane and therefore lie beyond the typical reach of protein-based drugs, such as antibodies, that do not effectively cross cell membranes. Ongoing trials seeking to use antibody therapy to bind to the misfolded proteins can only do so while proteins are outside cell membranes, which is a relative minority of their life cycle.
The toxic consequences of protein misfolding and aggregation ultimately result in cell death, and the accumulation of dead cells within specific brain regions marks the progression of disease symptoms and severity. It is our goal to keep cells alive by protecting them from the consequences of these misfolded proteins, thereby slowing disease progression. Our discovery engine is designed to better understand the processes through which protein misfolding and aggregation trigger cellular toxicity, and to do so in a manner that allows us to identify a network of new targets and biological processes which, when modulated using a therapeutic drug, we believe will ameliorate the toxicities initiated by protein misfolding, allow the cells to continue to function normally, and halt the progression of disease. We believe the identification of these new targets and close-in biology networks, and the molecules that modulate them, enables us to provide a new treatment approach to neurodegenerative drug discovery.
Our Programs
We have leveraged our discovery engine to identify more than twenty diverse biological targets not previously linked to neurodegenerative disease that we believe are suitable for a future disease-modifying drug discovery program. Our lead program, YTX-7739 for the potential treatment and disease-modification of Parkinson’s disease, is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials. In collaboration with Merck, we are also currently in the lead optimization process for another potential program for the potential treatment of ALS and FTLD.
   Our Lead Program – YTX-7739
We have been developing YTX-7739 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. YTX-7739 is the first prioritized drug candidate identified by our discovery engine and is designed to reduce α-synuclein toxicity by inhibiting SCD, an enzyme that metabolizes saturated fatty acids to their monounsaturated form.
Parkinson’s Disease Overview
Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive neurological disorder of the central nervous system and the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the United States after Alzheimer’s disease, with an estimated 500,000 to one million prevalent cases. More than 10 million people worldwide are believed to have Parkinson’s disease. In patients with Parkinson’s disease, the premature death of neurons in the brain reduces levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, causing motor dysfunction including tremor, slow movement, muscle rigidity, and difficulty with balance, falling, swallowing, speech, and writing. Other changes in the brain associated with the disease may result in cognitive and sensory symptoms. Additional features of the disease include disruptions in nerves connecting the brain to other systems such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and urogenital systems, as well as sleep disturbances, constipation, and loss of sense of smell. Later-stage Parkinson’s disease is severely debilitating, and its symptoms make sufferers more likely to experience life-threatening medical issues. As a result, while Parkinson’s does not directly cause death, it is nevertheless the fourteenth leading cause of death in the United States.
Approximately 60,000 people are diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in the United States each year, most often after the age of 50. The National Institutes of Health estimates the annual cost of treating Parkinson’s disease in the United States to be $14 billion, with indirect costs such as lost productivity adding at least another $6 billion. As with many other neurodegenerative diseases, the greatest

risk factor for Parkinson’s disease is increasing age. The growing population of older adults and longer average lifespans are therefore likely to increase the number of Parkinson’s patients and the need for effective treatments. Currently, it is estimated that the number people diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in the United States will double by the year 2040.
Although certain Parkinson’s disease cases have been associated with rare gene mutations, both hereditary and environmental factors are likely to contribute to the occurrence of Parkinson’s disease in the majority of cases. Additionally, while the biological cause of most cases of Parkinson’s disease is not clear, the core pathology of Parkinson’s disease is degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. In certain cases, cell loss occurs in association with the formation of intraneuronal Lewy inclusion bodies. Abnormally aggregated α-synuclein is the principal component of Lewy bodies, which are the pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. The presence of Lewy bodies and other associated fibrils is correlated with neuron loss and death, decline in motor function and cognitive dysfunction.
Limitations of Current Therapies
There is currently no known cure for Parkinson’s disease. Pharmacological therapies for Parkinson’s disease are aimed at either temporarily replenishing dopamine or mimicking the action of dopamine. They generally help reduce muscle rigidity, improve speed and coordination of movement and lessen tremor.
The dopamine precursor levodopa is the most commonly prescribed pharmacotherapy. While extremely helpful overall, some symptoms do not respond as well to levodopa, like difficulty with balance, falling, difficulty with speech and swallowing, and memory issues. It can also be challenging to titrate and find the optimal dose and patients may experience “on” and “off” periods when the drug concentration falls to below their individual needs. Unfortunately, the long-term use of levodopa is frequently associated with the development of additional motor complications, for example dyskinesias, or uncontrolled, involuntary movements. Additional therapies attempt to slow the degradation of dopamine using monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors. Catechol-o-methyltransferase inhibitors and carbidopa may be used to reduce levodopa degradation. Amantadine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate, or NMDA, receptor antagonist, is also used and may act through more than one mechanism. Drug treatment for Parkinson’s disease is commonly individualized by patient and disease characteristics, and patients may receive multiple drug therapies throughout their course of disease, including other medications for comorbid conditions and symptomatic management such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, and anti-psychotics. While these therapies address the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, they are unable to halt disease progression over the longer-term. As a result, these symptomatic therapies lose their efficacy over time, leaving patients with few treatment options.
Outside of drug therapy, electrical deep brain stimulation is also be used to control motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, typically in the advanced stages of disease. In addition to pharmacotherapy, a holistic approach to treatment is encouraged and patients may gain benefit from regular exercise, psychological, physical, occupational and speech therapy, nutrition consultation, education, support groups, and the use of assistive devices and caregiver relief.
There are currently a small number of early clinical trials investigating the potential of directly reducing α-synuclein to change the course of the disease. These programs, however, are predominantly based on antibody therapy which, due to their large size, do not readily enter the brain or brain cells and are believed to interact only with extracellular α-synuclein that has been secreted or released from cells. Formation of pathological α-synuclein aggregates, known as Lewy bodies, occurs inside of cells, and the ability of therapeutic antibodies to impact consequent toxic α-synuclein cascades is unclear.
Our Solution
YTX-7739 is a small molecule with potential to slow or halt disease progression in patients suffering with Parkinson’s disease. Using our discovery engine and Parkinson’s disease patient cell lines, we identified SCD as a biological target enzyme for diseases caused by α-synuclein-mediated toxicity. YTX-7739 is designed to inhibit SCD to reduce α-synuclein-mediated toxicity within cells.
The α-Synuclein Toxicity Cascade
Aggregated α-synuclein protein is the primary constituent of the pathological Lewy bodies formed in the brains of patients with Parkinson’s disease. Although its precise molecular function is poorly understood, α-synuclein is known to be a membrane-associated lipid binding protein and has been implicated in vesicle trafficking, a process by which cells transport materials between different cellular destinations, as well as in membrane curvature and fusion.

In yeast, the overexpression of α-synuclein causes severe cellular toxicity by disrupting multiple cellular mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking. These disruptions occur in both yeast models and mammalian systems, where mutations or overexpression of α-synuclein increases the amount of membrane-associated α-synuclein, which in turn impairs vesicle trafficking and increases cellular stress and toxicity. Importantly, human genetic studies indicate mutations and overexpression of α-synuclein lead to severe and rapidly progressing forms of Parkinson’s disease, and this relationship to disease severity almost certainly involves toxic effects of α-synuclein aggregates on the functions of cell membranes.
YTX-7739’s Target
We discovered SCD as a result of our unbiased phenotypic screening efforts, which identified a series of compounds that potently protected cells against α-synuclein-mediated toxicity. Using our discovery engine’s target identification capability, we were able to identify that the specific biological target implicated in this protection was inhibition of Ole1, the single yeast fatty-acid desaturase enzyme and direct counterpart of SCD in humans.
Ole1 in yeast and SCD in humans are enzymes that metabolize saturated lipids and break them down into their unsaturated lipid components. Unsaturated lipids are important components of cell membranes because of the processes they regulate, including membrane fluidity, curvature, and fusion. Paradoxically, the greater the level of unsaturated lipid in membranes, the greater the vesicle trafficking impairment and toxicity caused by α-synuclein. Inhibiting SCD enzymatic activity reduces the levels of unsaturated lipids, which ameliorates the detrimental vesicle trafficking defects associated with increased α-synuclein expression. Our hypothesis is that reducing SCD activity will reduce abnormal vesicle trafficking within cells caused by α-synuclein, thereby reducing the accumulation of neurotoxicity and slowing the progression of neurologic impairment in patients with Parkinson’s disease and related disorders.
The chart below demonstrates the impact of inhibiting the SCD enzyme in a diseased human cell line prepared from a patient with Parkinson’s disease. This patient had a single amino acid mutation in the α-synuclein protein sequence. The red line shows the risk of cell death in cells containing the α-synuclein mutation. The black line, which shows lower risk of death, is a control cell line – genetically identical to the Parkinson’s disease patient cell line but with a correction of the α-synuclein mutation generated using CRISPR technology. The increasing shades of blue lines represent the survival of the mutation-containing cells upon exposure to increasing concentrations of a potent SCD inhibitor. As the chart shows, inhibition of SCD reduces cell death in the mutation-containing cell line down to the levels of the mutation-corrected control. The improved survival effect is dependent upon the concentration of SCD inhibitor.
Cell death in Parkinson’s patient cell line corrected by inhibition of SCD
   
In addition to demonstrating that inhibition of SCD can protect human neurons grown in a dish, we have also explored the effects of SCD inhibition in a new mouse model of Parkinson’s disease. This mouse was engineered to express a mutant version of human α-synuclein, which leads to progressive motor deficits and pathological neuron cell loss in the brain that are similar to the progression seen in Parkinson’s disease. Dopamine replacement therapy, the standard of care in Parkinson’s therapy, can partially reverse the motor deficits in these engineered mice, demonstrating the disease-relevance of the model. When these mice were administered YTX-7739 for 4 months, the expected motor deficits never developed, whereas similar mice in the same study that received placebo evidenced the expected altered motor behaviors. Interestingly, when the SCD1 gene was removed in these engineered α-synuclein

mice, known as a gene knockout, which would mimic the effects of an SCD inhibitor, these mice also had significantly reduced motor deficits and pathological neuron loss. These studies demonstrate the consistent effect of reducing SCD activity and validate SCD as a target for reducing the toxic effects of α-synuclein in disease-relevant models.
Motor Behavior at Six Months of Age
      While we have established that SCD inhibition protects cells from α-synuclein toxicity, the precise mechanism of protection has not been defined. We believe there are at least three possible mechanisms of action: (1) SCD inhibition reverses a toxic increase in fatty acid desaturation triggered by α-synuclein aggregation, (2) SCD inhibition directly antagonizes toxic effects of α-synuclein on membrane properties and/or trafficking, or (3) reduced fatty acid desaturation ameliorates a direct toxic interaction of α-synuclein with cell membranes.
The knowledge of SCD enzyme biology also allows us to define a biomarker that can be used to measure target inhibition. Specifically, because the substrates for SCD are sixteen-carbon, or C16, or eighteen-carbon, or C18, saturated fatty acids, and the products are C16 and C18 monounsaturated fatty acids, we can therefore monitor drug effects on SCD by measuring the amount, or ratio, of the C16 and C18 precursors and their monounsaturated products. The result of this analysis gives us the fatty-acid desaturation index, or FA-DI, expressed as a ratio of the amount of monounsaturated C16 or C18 substrates divided by the amount of corresponding saturated fatty acid. The FA-DI gives us a biomarker that allows it to measure the effects of its compounds on SCD in vitro and in vivo.
Clinical Trials
YTX-7739 is currently in Phase 1 clinical development consisting of a single ascending dose (SAD) study in healthy volunteers, and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in healthy volunteers, with a Phase 1b part in patients with Parkinson’s disease. The SAD study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of YTX-7739 in healthy volunteers, and has completed. The SAD study was conducted in three parts at one site in the Netherlands. The first part was to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of YTX-7739 in healthy subjects. The second and third parts were to study the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of YTX-7739 after administration in a fed state in healthy subjects.
Fifty-six healthy volunteers (aged 19-39 years of age; 22 males; 34 females) were administered single oral dose of YTX-7739, from 5 mg to 400 mg in the SAD study. Forty subjects participated in the placebo controlled, randomized, double blind part of the study which included seven cohorts of eight subjects each, randomized to YTX-7739 or placebo in a 6:2 ratio. Sixteen of these subjects also participated in two cohorts where YTX-7739 was administered with food. In addition, two cohorts of eight subjects each (16 subjects

in total) participated in an open label fashion to further inform dose selection for the MAD study. Safety assessments included, but were not limited to, adverse events, serious adverse events, safety laboratory tests, vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECG). In addition, plasma drug levels were collected to assess pharmacokinetic variables and a pharmacodynamic biomarker was also included to explore the potential of YTX-7739 to change plasma levels of fatty acids. There were no safety concerns identified and YTX-7739 was found to be generally well tolerated with most adverse events being mild or moderate in severity. The half-life of YTX-7739 combined with a favorable dose-proportional pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, in the fed state, supports that low daily doses administered with food will sustain the target range of exposure.
There were dose-linear increases in the maximum serum concentration achieved and the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve observed at 5 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg and 250 mg dose levels in the fed state, suggesting dose-proportionality of YTX-7739 exposure in the 5 – 250 mg dose range, when administered in a fed state. Drug plasma concentrations in the trial exceeded levels of exposure estimated to be sufficient for target engagement based on pharmacodynamic modeling. Consistent with preclinical data, YTX-7739 also demonstrated clinically relevant drug concentrations in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The results of this SAD trial supported progression to the MAD trial.

On November 10, 2021, we announced top-line data from our Phase 1b clinical trial of YTX-7739 in patients with mild-to-moderate Parkinson’s disease. The Phase 1b clinical trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multi dose study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of YTX-7739. Data were reported from 20 patients with mild-to-moderate Parkinson’s disease. Patients received once-daily oral doses of YTX-7739 (20 mg or placebo) for 28 days.
 
YTX-7739 was shown to inhibit its primary target, SCD, an enzyme whose inhibition has been closely linked to neuronal survival and improved motor function in a Parkinson’s disease model. After 28 days of treatment, the 20 mg dose given once-daily reduced the fatty acid desaturation index (FA-DI), a biomarker of SCD inhibition, by approximately 20%-40%, the range expected to be clinically relevant based on preclinical studies. Target engagement in the cerebrospinal fluid suggested that YTX-7739 crossed the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, the PK/PD profile of YTX-7739 was consistent with previous studies and we believe informs dose selection for future studies.

YTX-7739 was generally well tolerated with all treatment emergent adverse events being mild to moderate in severity. There were no serious adverse events. Moderate adverse events (AEs) in the active treatment group consisted of 2 patients with increased Parkinson’s symptoms, 2 patients with lower back pain, 1 patient with headache, 1 patient with myalgia, 1 patient with insomnia, 1 patient with ligament strain, and 1 patient with vaccination complication. One patient on placebo had moderate worsening of tremors and Parkinsonism, which led to discontinuation. AEs occurring at a higher percentage in 2 or more patients administered YTX-7739 compared to placebo were procedural pain, myalgia, dry eye, hyperbilirubinemia, hypesthesia, lower back pain, and constipation. AEs occurring at a higher percentage with placebo included orthostatic hypotension, headache, tremor, fatigue and dizziness.

As expected, after only 28 days of dosing, there were no statistically significant differences in clinical assessments (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS III), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) or most exploratory biomarkers. Quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) assessments of the effect of YTX-7739 on brain activity were completed in a subset of 8 patients and demonstrated a statistically significant change compared to baseline, suggestive of a potential improvement in synaptic function.
 Our Potential Additional Programs
We currently have two preclinical programs that are being progressed through a research collaboration with Merck. On December 17, 2021, Merck notified us that the first data package that we submitted for one program met the requirements to progress to the next stage of the research collaboration. Achievement of this milestone triggered a $5.0 million milestone payment from Merck, which was received in February 2022. We cannot provide assurance as to the timing of future milestones or royalty payments or that we will receive any of the future payments at all. Merck will be responsible for IND-enabling toxicology and safety pharmacology studies, as well as subsequent clinical development and commercialization.
ALS and FTLD Disease Overview
ALS, also referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. In healthy individuals, upper motor neurons in the brain send signals to lower motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem, which send signals to muscles, thereby generating body movement. In ALS, both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die, resulting in loss of muscle function with progression to severe impairment of mobility, speech, and communication.
Early symptoms of ALS usually include muscle weakness or stiffness, and over time, all muscles under voluntary control are affected. As ALS progresses, individuals lose their strength and the ability to speak, eat and move. Many sufferers lose the muscular ability to maintain breathing, requiring permanent ventilatory support. Individuals with ALS usually retain their ability to perform higher mental

processes such as reasoning, remembering, understanding, and problem solving, so they are entirely aware of their progressive loss of muscle function. Continued deterioration of muscle control leads to respiratory failure and death, with an average survival time of three years. About 20 percent of people with ALS live five years, 10 percent will survive 10 years and 5 percent will live 20 years or longer.
According to the ALS Association, in 2016, between 14,000 and 15,000 Americans had ALS. ALS is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 55 and 75, and only ten percent of people with ALS will survive for ten years or more. Medical and non-medical costs of ALS, including lost income, range between $256 million and $433 million each year in the United States, with annual costs from ALS exceeding $60,000 per patient.
FTLD is an umbrella term for a group of related syndromes and processes, often also called frontotemporal lobar dementia, frontotemporal degeneration or dementia or Pick’s disease, that impacts the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Formally, the process of frontotemporal degeneration results in the condition of frontotemporal dementia. Disease processes cause the degeneration of neurons and shrinking of the frontal and temporal brain regions, which causes progressive alterations in personality, behavior, and language. There are different types of FTLD, which manifest as a frontal or behavioral variant affecting behavior and personality, or as a primary progressive aphasia variant, which results in difficulty communicating due to loss of speech and inability to use and understand language. FTLD patients often exhibit aggressive and compulsive behaviors and have various changes in sexual behaviors.
 It is believed that the prevalence of FTLD in the United States is around 60,000 cases. There is a wide range of onset, from 21 to 80 years of age, with most cases occurring between 45 and 64 years of age. Given the younger age of onset as compared to Alzheimer’s disease, FTLD has been cited as the most common form of dementia in people under 60. Annual medical and nonmedical costs of FTLD are estimated at approximately $120,000 per patient, indicating a societal disease impact in the United States alone of over $7 billion annually.
These conditions are generally believed to exist as a spectrum disorder, with “pure” ALS as a neuromuscular disorder at one end of the spectrum, and “pure” FTLD as a dementia-related disorder at the other. Many patients exhibit varying degrees of both types of symptoms on this spectrum.
Limitations of Current Therapies
There is no known cure for ALS. The cause of ALS in 90% or more of cases is unknown. Known as sporadic ALS, genetic and environmental factors may play a role in these cases. In contrast, up to 10% of all ALS cases are of an inherited familial form. A number of genetic mutations have been implicated in familial ALS, most frequently C9orf72 and SOD1. In all cases of ALS, upper and lower motor neurons are lost, causing muscle dysfunction and atrophy. Two drugs have been approved in the United States for the treatment of ALS, riluzole and edaravone. Riluzole has demonstrated a survival benefit and edaravone delayed decline in an assessment of daily functioning.
There are also no known cures for FTLD, nor are there any approved medications for this disease. Patients are sometimes proscribed Riluzole, although its effectiveness in this indication is uncertain. To manage quality of life, antidepressants are prescribed to help with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and anti-psychotics can sometimes help control irrational and risky behavior. Sleep aids are also prescribed to help with insomnia and sleep disturbances.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the neurodegenerative disease field, are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that its discovery engine platform and its employees and consultants, scientific knowledge and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Several of these entities have commercial products, robust drug pipelines, readily available capital, and established research and development organizations. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of branded and generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future, including but not limited to:
•Parkinson’s disease: Currently available therapies for Parkinson’s disease include Levodopa, D2/D3-preferring agonists, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors as monotherapy or in combination, anticholinergics as well as deep brain stimulation devices by Medtronic Inc. and St. Jude Medical Inc., among others. We are also aware of several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing potentially disease modifying therapeutics for Parkinson’s disease, including Denali, Prothena, Roche (in partnership with Prothena), Novartis, AbbVie (in partnership with BioArctic AB), Voyager Therapeutics, Prevail Therapeutics, Sage Therapeutics, Neurocrine Biosciences, Eli Lilly, Biogen (in partnership with Ionis and Neurimmune), AstraZeneca, Takeda, IRLAB Therapeutics, Avanir Pharmaceuticals, and Lundbeck, that are in various stages of clinical development. 
 •Dementia with Lewy bodies: Currently available therapies to alleviate symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies include cholinesterase inhibitors, carbidopa/levodopa, memantine, “atypical” antipsychotics, melatonin, and clonazepam. We are also aware of several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutes developing potentially disease modifying therapeutics for dementia with Lewy bodies, including Lawson Health Research Institute, Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company, Georgetown University, Pfizer, Eisai, Allergan and Novartis, that are in various stages of clinical development. 
 •ALS: Currently available therapies for ALS include riluzole (Rilutek®) and edaravone (Radicava®). We are also aware of several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions developing potentially disease modifying therapeutics for ALS, including Denali, Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Biogen (in partnership with Ionis), Neuropore Therapies, Cytokinetics and Mallinckrodt, that are in various stages of clinical development. 
 •FTLD: There are no currently available therapies indicated for FTLD, however some patients are prescribed riluzole (Rilutek®) and other medications to manage symptoms such as antidepressants, antipsychotics and sleep aids. We are also aware of several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing potentially disease modifying therapeutics for FTLD, including Alector, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Biogen, TauRx Therapeutics and Bayer, that are in various stages of clinical development. 
 Collaboration Agreement with Merck
In June 2020, we entered into an exclusive license and research collaboration agreement, or the Merck Collaboration Agreement, with Merck to support the research, development and commercialization of products for the treatment of ALS and FTLD.
Pursuant to the Merck Collaboration Agreement, we granted Merck an exclusive, worldwide license with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses, under certain intellectual property rights related to two certain undisclosed targets in connection with our ALS and FTLD programs to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell and sell compounds and products covered by such intellectual property rights. In the event that the exploitation of such compound or product would infringe during the term of the Merck Collaboration Agreement a claim of an issued patent controlled by us, we also granted Merck a non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free license under such issued patent to exploit such compound and product.
Under the terms of the Merck Collaboration Agreement, we and Merck are each responsible to perform certain research activities in accordance with a mutually agreed upon research plan. Upon the completion of certain stages of the research plan, Merck will elect to either advance or terminate the applicable research program. Following completion of the research program, Merck is responsible for the development and commercialization of the compounds developed pursuant to the research program and any product containing such compounds.
As consideration for the licenses granted to Merck under the Merck Collaboration Agreement, Merck paid us a one-time upfront payment and also purchased Class C preferred units of Holdings. Under the terms of the Merck Collaboration Agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $280 million if Merck elects to advance the research program and upon achievement of specified research and development milestones, and up to $250 million upon achievement of specified sales-based milestones as well as a tiered, mid-single digit royalty on net sales of licensed products, subject to customary reductions. Merck’s royalty obligations for each licensed product continue on a country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the last-to-expire valid claim of the patent rights in such country or (ii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
On December 17, 2021, Merck notified us that Merck has accepted the first data package from our research collaboration relating to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, or FTLD, and that

Merck has elected to continue the research collaboration. Achievement of this milestone triggers a $5.0 million milestone payment from Merck, which was received in February 2022.
 Unless terminated earlier, the Merck Collaboration Agreement will continue in full force and effect until one or more products has received marketing authorization and, thereafter, until expiration of all royalty obligations under the Merck Collaboration Agreement. We or Merck may terminate the Merck Collaboration Agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other party or insolvency of the other party. Merck may also terminate the Merck Collaboration Agreement for any reason upon certain notice to us.
License Agreement with Whitehead Institute
In February 2016, we entered into a tangible property and exclusive patent license agreement or the Whitehead License Agreement, with the Whitehead Institute which was subsequently amended in April 2016, August 2016 and July 2018. Pursuant to the Whitehead License Agreement, the Whitehead Institute granted us a worldwide license under certain patent rights to develop, commercialize and sell products and to develop and perform processes covered by such patents for the treatment of any disease in humans other than certain specified treatments for infectious diseases and cancer. The Whitehead Institute also granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use certain know-how and to use and make certain biological materials.
The patent rights licensed to us under the Whitehead License Agreement relate to our discovery engine and are directed to compositions and methods for identifying novel disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Such patent rights include patent rights developed or co-developed by Dr. Lindquist as an employee of Howard Hughes Medical Institute, as well as patents owned or jointly owned by the University of Chicago, the University of Washington, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Curators of the University of Missouri and Pfizer, Inc. Our license under such patent rights is exclusive, subject to certain retained rights and certain patent rights previously licensed by the Whitehead Institute. Additionally, our exclusivity with respect to patent rights jointly owned by Pfizer, Inc. only applies to the Whitehead Institute’s right as a joint owner of such patents.
Under the terms of the Whitehead License Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products or processes and to introduce such licensed products or processes into the commercial market. Thereafter, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to make such licensed products or processes reasonably available to the public. In addition, in any given year until the first regulatory approval of a licensed product, we have diligence requirements to achieve a certain development milestone with respect to a licensed product or expend a minimum amount of money for platform development and/or development of licensed products or processes.
As consideration for the licenses granted to us under the Whitehead License Agreement, we paid an initial license fee and reimbursed the Whitehead Institute for certain expenses incurred in connection with the patent rights. Holdings also issued 3,000 common units (which, following a 100:1 unit split, represented 300,000 units) to the Whitehead Institute and certain persons and entities as directed by the Whitehead Institute in satisfaction of the Whitehead Institute’s policy on equity sharing. Under the terms of the Whitehead License Agreement, we are also required to pay an annual license maintenance fee which is creditable against royalties on net sales earned during the same calendar year. In addition, we are obligated to make payments to the Whitehead Institute upon achievement of certain milestones, the amount of which depends on the licensed product and indication, with up to an aggregate of $1.9 million for each of the first two licensed products for the first indication and less for subsequent licensed products and additional indications. We are also required to pay the Whitehead Institute a low single digit royalty percentage of net sales of licensed products and a low single digit royalty on net sales of products determined to have biological activity or utility by the use of a licensed product or process, or Identified Products. Additionally, we are required to pay a mid single to low double digit percentage of certain income received from sublicensees and certain partners. Our royalty obligation continues on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis for so long as the manufacture, use or sale of such licensed product in such country infringes a valid claim of the patent rights or, with respect to each Identified Product, for ten years after the first sale for consumption by an end user patient of such Identified Product.
Unless terminated earlier, the Whitehead License Agreement will expire upon the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications within the licensed patent rights, which is currently projected to occur in 2035. The Whitehead Institute may terminate the Whitehead License Agreement upon notice to us if we cease to carry on our business related to the Whitehead License Agreement, if we fail to make required payments within a certain period time or if we commit a material breach and fail to cure such breach within a certain period of time. The Whitehead Institute may also terminate the Whitehead License Agreement and/or the licenses granted to us if we bring or assist others in bringing a patent challenge against the Whitehead Institute. We may terminate the Whitehead License Agreement for any reason upon certain notice to the Whitehead Institute.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, or protection for, our product candidates and methods of manufacture and clinical use are an important part of our strategy to develop and commercialize novel therapies. We have filed numerous patent applications pertaining to our product

candidates and clinical use. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of its business by seeking, maintaining and defending our intellectual property, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of neurodegenerative diseases and protein misfolding. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity and market exclusivity, as well as patent term extensions, where available.
As of March 15, 2022, our patent portfolio as it pertains to certain of its product candidates included:
•Our Lead Program – YTX-7739: one granted U.S. patent expected to expire in 2038; two pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, and twenty-eight pending patent applications outside the U.S., which, if pursued and granted, would be expected to expire in 2038-2039, without taking a potential patent term adjustment or extension into account, with composition of matter claims directed to the YTX-7739 compounds and method claims directed to the treatment of neurological disorders, for example SCD-associated disorders, or inhibiting toxicity in a cell relating to a protein; and two pending provisional U.S. patent applications, which, if pursued and granted in the U.S., would be expected to expire in 2042; 
 •Our Potential Programs – YTX-9184: one granted U.S. patent expected to expire in 2038; three pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, one pending international patent (PCT) application, and thirty one pending patent applications outside the U.S., which, if pursued and granted in the U.S., would be expected to expire in 2037-2040, without taking a potential patent term adjustment or extension into account, with composition of matter claims directed to one of our proprietary compounds and method claims directed to the treatment of neurological disorders, for example SCD-associated disorders, or inhibiting toxicity in a cell relating to a protein; seven pending U.S. provisional patent applications, which, if pursued and granted in the U.S., would be expected to expire in 2041, without taking a potential patent term adjustment or extension into account, with composition of matter and claims directed to compounds and method claims directed to the treatment of neurological disorders using inhibitors of an undisclosed target; four pending U.S. provisional patent applications, which, if pursued and granted in the U.S., would be expected to expire in 2041, without taking a potential patent term adjustment or extension into account, with composition of matter claims directed to compounds and methods claims directed to the treatment of neurological disorders using inhibitors of an undisclosed target. 
 In addition, we have in-licensed an estate of patents and patent applications relating to our discovery engine from the Whitehead Institute which is directed to compositions and methods for identifying novel disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and ALS. For example, this estate includes granted and pending claims to a number of yeast models of protein misfolding and methods of use thereof. As of March 15, 2022, this estate includes twenty-four granted U.S. patents, projected to expire between 2022-2035; one pending U.S. patent applications, which if granted in the U.S., would be expected to expire in 2038, without taking a potential patent term adjustment or extension into account; thirty-one granted foreign patents, projected to expire between 2025-2035; and eight pending foreign patent applications, which if granted, would be expected to expire between 2034-2038. We do not control the prosecution and maintenance of all of our in-licensed patents and patent applications, and our rights to enforce the patents are limited in certain ways. For additional detail regarding the risks associated with our license agreements, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
The term of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date in the absence, for example, of a terminal disclaimer shortening the term of the patent or patent term adjustment increasing the term of the patent. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of FDA regulatory review periods. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date.

In addition to patents and patent applications that we own and license, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain its competitive position. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seeks to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and commercial partners.
Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing its products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to our intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will issue from any of the pending patent applications to which we own or that we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be issued in the future to us will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and methods of using or manufacturing the same. Moreover, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for certain aspects of its product candidates generally, as well as with respect to certain indications. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval.
Currently, all of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced at contract manufacturing facilities.
Commercialization
We intend to develop and, if approved by the FDA, to commercialize our product candidates alone or in collaboration with others. We may work in combination with one or more large pharmaceutical partners for certain indications, where specialist capabilities are needed. We may enter into distribution or licensing arrangements for commercialization rights for other regions outside the United States.
 Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, a manufacturer may need to recall a product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; 


•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each proposed indication; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug; 
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 
 Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials
The nonclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the nonclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. These nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLPs for safety and toxicology studies. The sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND application. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND application must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development of a product candidate.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completion. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. In the United States, information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trials results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.

As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016, upon request, the FDA is to establish a process for the qualification of drug development tools. A drug development tool includes a biomarker including a surrogate endpoint, a clinical outcome assessment including a patient-reported outcome, and any other method, material or measure that the FDA determines aids drug development and regulatory review. A drug development tool is qualified if the FDA has determined that the tool and its proposed context of use can be relied upon to have a specific interpretation and application in drug development and regulatory review. A qualified drug development tool may be used to support the investigational use of a drug or support or obtain NDA approval.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if the agency deems it necessary.
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. 
 •Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits and provide a preliminary evaluation of efficacy. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or comparator treatments. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. 
 Post-approval studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 calendar days for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, finding from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Additionally, a sponsor must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may recommend that the clinical trial be stopped if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
A drug being studied in clinical trials may be made available to individual patients in certain circumstances. Pursuant to the Cures Act, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug, or as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative advanced therapy. Further, the Right to Try Act, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to request access to certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.


Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
NDA and FDA Review Process
The results of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug to the satisfaction of the FDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is $3,117,218. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for human drugs ($369,413). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, for drugs that contain a new chemical entity, or NCE, the FDA has 10 months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for a priority NDA. For drugs that do not contain an NCE, these 10 and six month review timeframes are from the receipt date of an NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request an opportunity for a hearing. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.

There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of the approved product. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and efficacy and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA also may place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. The sponsor of a fast track product may request that the FDA review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete NDA is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under the fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or offers a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as

substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, and breakthrough designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Additionally, a drug may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drugs studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials for products being considered for accelerated approval.
 Fast track designation, priority review, breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Moreover, even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Pediatric Trials
The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the FDA of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA.
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific facilities and in accordance with cGMP. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are

subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. Changes in statutes, regulations, or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Orange Book Listing
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application in which the applicant, in part, relies on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. Limited changes must be preapproved by the FDA via a suitability petition. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include nonclinical and clinical data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents having claims that cover the applicant’s product and method of use. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book. These products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.
Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make patent certifications to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug or method of use that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) the patent has expired; (3) the date on which the patent has expired and approval will not be sought until after the patent expiration; or (4) the patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through a paragraph IV certification or if the applicant is not seeking approval of a patented method of use. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the competitor has provided a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the reference listed drug and the patent owner within 20 days after the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay.

In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owners regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation.
U.S. Marketing Exclusivity
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for an NCE. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Three-year and five-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
U.S. Patent-Term Extension
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our current product candidates or any future product candidate, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Act. The Hatch Waxman Act permits extension of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term extension period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension (and only those patent claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended), and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension. In the future, we may apply for extension of a patent term for our currently owned patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. However, there can be no assurance that the USPTO will grant us any requested patent term extension, either for the length we request or at all.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, ACA, enacted in the United States in March 2010, has already had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our product candidates are the following:

•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biological products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 •a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
 •an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively; 
 •expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the AKS, which include, among other things, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;
•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% in 2019 pursuant to subsequent legislation) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 
 •extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 
 •expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; 
 •expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; 
 •the requirements under the federal open payments program and its implementing regulations; 
 •a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and 
 •a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example:
 •On August 2, 2011, the U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022.
 •On January 2, 2013, the U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
 •On April 13, 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
 •On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 


•On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
 •On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.
 Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. Federal Government will pay for healthcare drugs and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain drug access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Manufacturing, sales, promotion, and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, CMS, other divisions of HHS including the Office of the Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local regulatory authorities. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, the privacy and

security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, or recommendation of any good, facility, item, or service (including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug), for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. “Remuneration” has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Further, courts have found that if “one purpose” of renumeration is to induce referrals, the federal Anti-Kickback statute is violated. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities.
Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to or approval by federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services, knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in its stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
HIPAA created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that any of our product candidates, if approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses, and health plans, known as covered entities, as well as independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain individually identifiable health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity, known as a business associates. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.

The U.S. federal transparency requirements under the ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, require applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members.
Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state and require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws, including for example the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective May 2018 also governs the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Other regulations may affect other aspects of our business. For example, pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturers’ marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate its business and its financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of its business.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our drugs will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance. Third-party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent our products will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 •safe, effective and medically necessary; 
 •appropriate for the specific patient; 


•cost-effective; and 
 •neither experimental nor investigational. 
 We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, we cannot be sure that the level of reimbursement will be adequate. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Limited coverage and less than adequate reimbursement may reduce the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval.
These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of such drugs and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our drugs covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal drug on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our drugs. Historically, drugs launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
European Drug Development
In the European Union, our product candidates may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of nonclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
In April 2014, the European Union adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the new Regulation offer sponsors the possibility to choose between the requirements of the previous Directive and the new Regulation if the request for authorization of a clinical trial is submitted in the year after the new Regulation became applicable. If the sponsor chooses to submit under the previous Directive, the clinical trial continues to be governed by the Directive until three years after the new Regulation became applicable. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years after the Regulation became applicable, the new Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The new Regulation overhauls the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the European Union. Specifically, the new Regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State), aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the new Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures

for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all European Union Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have also been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
 European Drug Review and Approval
In the European Union, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. There are two main types of marketing authorizations:
•The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the European Union and the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, including products derived from biotechnological processes, advanced-therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy and tissue-engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the European Union, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant an MA, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding clocks stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the European Union, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States, or CMSs) for their approval. If the CMSs raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the CMSs). 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required.
European Data and Market Exclusivity
In the European Union, innovative medicinal products, approved on the basis of a complete independent data package, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the European Union, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity a generic or biosimilar MA application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed in the European Union until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an MA for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained an MA based on an MA application with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
 European Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the European Union, the European Commission, based on the recommendation of the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, grants orphan designation to promote the development of products that: (1) are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions; (2) either (i) such condition affects no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (ii) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union or, if such a method exists, the product would be of a significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
 In the European Union, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing approval for the orphan medicinal product. This period is extended by two years for compliance with an agreed upon pediatric investigation plan granted at the time of review of the orphan designation. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, an MA may only be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if (i) the holder of the MA for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application, (ii) the holder of the MA for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply sufficient quantities of the orphan medicinal product, or (iii) the second applicant can establish that the second medicinal product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the authorized orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
In case an MA for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the MA is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include:
•Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations. 
 •The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union. 
 •The marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of products and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU. 
 The aforementioned European Union rules are generally applicable in the EEA.


Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
In June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), and the United Kingdom officially withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, or Transition Period, during which European Union rules continued to apply. However, the European Union and the United Kingdom have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and European Union pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented European Union legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the European Union regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current European Union regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the European Union and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of United Kingdom and European Union pharmaceutical legislation. For example, the new Clinical Trials Regulation which became effective in the EU on January 31, 2022 and provides for a streamlined clinical trial application and assessment procedure covering multiple EU Member States has not been implemented into UK law, and a separate application will need to be submitted for clinical trial authorization in the UK.

The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA is governed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR, which went into effect on May 25, 2018 and superseded the Data Protection Directive. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that provides goods or services to residents in the EEA. This would include companies that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data (including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements), creates direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors, and imposes special protections for “sensitive information,” which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the EU. The GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, and allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances. Additionally, the GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law (referred to as the ‘UK GDPR’). The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the European Union’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the United Kingdom is regarded as a third country under the EU GDPR, the European Commission has now issued a decision recognizing the United Kingdom as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EEA to the United Kingdom remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the United Kingdom to countries not regarded by the United Kingdom as providing adequate protection. The United Kingdom government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the United Kingdom to the EEA remain free flowing.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 40 full-time employees, including 27 in research, 1 in clinical development and 12 in general and administrative, and 1 part-time employee, and seventeen of our full-time employees held M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. In February we also began implementation of a strategic restructuring with the objective of preserving capital. As part of the restructuring, we are eliminating approximately 60% of our workforce and took other actions.
 We are highly dependent on our management and scientific and medical personnel, and it is crucial that we continue to retain valuable employees. To facilitate retention, we strive to make us a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation and benefits programs. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective-bargaining arrangements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
