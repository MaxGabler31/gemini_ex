RIO, which is expanding its customer base across Europe, matches leading suppliers with the best tailored solutions to support fleets and enable them to pick and choose from a broad range of digital tools. 
Steering Technologies
Steering technology was integrated into the WABCO product portfolio with the 2017 acquisition of R.H. Sheppard Co., Inc. (Sheppard), a leading North America steering manufacturer. This enables WABCO to combine steering technologies with active braking, electronic stability control and other advanced driver assistance systems. This represents a major step toward providing lateral control through active steering, which is a cornerstone to WABCO’s ability to control longitudinal movement through active breaking, stability and suspension controls. 
Transmission Automation
WABCO AMT products include control technology that boosts fuel economy while reducing emissions. It enables drivers to focus further attention on road and traffic conditions, resulting in increased comfort and safety. It also helps to minimize any performance gap between highly skilled and less experienced drivers. Our industry continues to adopt AMT technology with great growth potential in the United States and Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) as original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and fleet operators seek to increase driver comfort and safety.
Advanced Braking Systems
WABCO's ABS prevents the wheel from locking during emergency braking situations and thereby helps commercial vehicle drivers to maintain stability of the vehicle. ABS also helps to bring a vehicle to a complete stop with the shortest possible stopping distance and in the safest possible way. Electronic activation of the EBS braking components reduces response and build-up times in brake cylinders. This in turn reduces braking distance by several meters, which can be decisive in some situations. The integrated ABS function ensures driving stability and steerability throughout the braking procedure.
A new generation of ADB products was released in 2018 as part of our MAXX™ product suite. This is a new generation of high-performance single-piston ADB for trucks, buses and trailers world-wide, and is expected to further accelerate the industry’s conversion from conventional drum brakes to ADB. WABCO showcased this pioneering suite of MAXX ADB technology at IAA Commercial Vehicles 2018 in Hanover, Germany. 
With over six million single-piston ADB systems sold, including more than one million systems proven in the field for 30,000 Nm heavy-duty applications, WABCO is the well-established global market leader for this advanced technology. WABCO’s fifth generation range of single-piston ADB technology is suitable for all types of light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles. Superbly

engineered, MAXX’s new lighter weight, high-performance and low drag-torque design further boosts fuel efficiency and enables increased transport payloads. 
The latest MAXX design provides enhanced safety and braking efficiency levels, outperforming the requirements for all major vehicle applications. With 20 percent fewer parts than the current design, and over 40 percent fewer parts compared to other ADB brands, the platform offers reliability and an excellent weight-performance ratio. Delivering enhanced fuel efficiency, the compact design offers an average weight of 35 kilograms per ADB in a six-by-two wheel truck application - 12 kilograms less per truck than other manufacturers’ European heavy-duty ADB systems. 
WABCO has accelerated its single-piston ADB technology leadership in China with the launch of a new joint venture for vehicle control systems in 2018. This new joint venture with FAW Jiefang Automotive Company is designed to advance the safety and efficiency of commercial vehicles in China. A major focus of the joint venture will be heavy-duty trucks given WABCO’s mastery of single-piston ADB technology for 30,000 Nm applications which have a compact, lightweight design with fewer components and are proven to deliver the highest standards of safety, performance and reliability. WABCO’s industry-leading, high-performance single-piston ADB technology is best suited for all types of commercial vehicles - light, medium and heavy-duty platforms. 
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
WABCO also offers a comprehensive suite of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) that include lane departure warning systems (LDWS) and collision mitigation systems. Safety regulations driven by the European Union started in 2015 and mandated LDWS on new commercial vehicles. This new regulation is addressed by WABCO’s OnLane™ camera-based LDWS technology. Once it detects unintended lane drift, OnLane prompts the driver via acoustic, visual and haptic signals to take corrective measures. It also features an advanced option to warn against driver drowsiness. In 2017, WABCO introduced OnSide™, an advanced blind-spot detection system for commercial trucks and trailers. This new radar-based system alerts drivers to the presence of a moving vehicle in a truck’s blind spot and provides a side-collision warning to reduce the risk of accidents. When used in conjunction with WABCO’s OnLaneASSIST™ lane-keeping assist system, OnSide can go beyond warning to enable active collision avoidance. WABCO’s OnLaneASSIST is the first application of active steering technology in our portfolio of advanced driver assistance systems and OnSide provides a critical capability for the autonomous commercial vehicles of the future. 
WABCO is the global industry supplier of collision mitigation systems and ADAS to OEMs with more than 450,000 OnGuard safety systems sold world-wide. The scalable and modular architecture of OnGuard solutions offer a number of powerful differentiating benefits for OEMs. WABCO was the first supplier of advanced emergency braking systems (AEBS) homologated in Europe in accordance with European Union regulations. WABCO's OnGuardACTIVE™ AEBS for trucks and buses complies with European Union regulations that came into effect at the tail end of 2015. It detects moving, stopping and stationary vehicles ahead. It alerts the driver via acoustic, visual and haptic signals. OnGuardACTIVE autonomously applies the brakes and can bring the vehicle to a complete stop, helping to prevent or mitigate rear-end collisions. 
In 2018, WABCO announced the latest functionalities added to its industry-leading suite of OnGuard™ collision mitigation systems (CMS) featuring a new radar sensor which offers the commercial vehicle industry’s longest radar detection range, as well as the widest near-range field of view. WABCO’s OnGuardACTIVE can now provide up to full autonomous emergency braking on moving and stationery vehicles from a highway speed up to 80 km per hour - even in poor visibility conditions. WABCO’s OnGuardMAX utilizes the radar sensor integrated with a new jointly developed Mobileye® camera powered by its industry-leading EyeQ®4 chip. This system further differentiates itself by enabling autonomous collision avoidance with pedestrians intruding in front of the vehicle at speeds up to 20km/h. 
Additionally, in 2018, WABCO signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Valeo, an automotive technology leader at the center of several automotive industry innovations, to develop and industrialize the next generation of ADAS, which is among the key building blocks for vehicle autonomy. Within the scope of this agreement, the parties intend to develop sensor technologies helping pave the way for Valeo to supply WABCO with advanced short and mid-range sensors, including 77GHz radar and solid-state LiDAR. The first market application using Valeo’s sensing technologies will be WABCO’s OnCityALERT™, an urban turning driver assistance solution that warns about cyclists and pedestrians potentially crossing the predicted driving path, prompting the driver to take corrective action. On average, traffic accidents involving heavy trucks in the European community result in about 7,200 fatalities and over 100,000 injuries each year. 23 percent of all traffic-related severe injuries are unprotected road users and of that number, 20 percent of accidents occur during a turning maneuver to the nearside.

Autonomous Driving 
Taking the next step towards autonomous driving solutions and to further complement our ADAS technology, WABCO signed an MOU in 2018 with Baidu to collaborate on developing a best-in-class, cost-effective and highly standardized suite of solutions for Level 4 Autonomous Driving in hub-to-hub highway applications for commercial vehicles. This will be a cornerstone of an open platform allowing OEMs and fleets to utilize WABCO’s and Baidu’s core safety and AI technologies while providing them an opportunity to develop customized, differentiated solutions. Baidu will bring the power of Apollo, its open autonomous driving software platform, proven in the passenger car segment, while WABCO will provide access to its own ADOPT™ (Autonomous Driving Open Platform Technology) ecosystem to simplify entry into WABCO’s world of advanced technologies for the commercial vehicle industry. WABCO and Baidu will work together to combine the required content of Baidu’s Apollo software platform, integrating all the safety and redundancy protocols necessary for road release in order to develop turnkey, hub-to-hub, Level 4 highway solutions for the commercial vehicle world. Our goal is to be able to commercialize these solutions over the next three years. 
Electrification
In 2018, WABCO announced a prototype of its first electric trailer - named eTrailer - developed to maximize operating efficiency and lower fuel consumption. This eTrailer prototype uses an intelligent electric motor control to recuperate electric energy during braking, which can then be reutilized to power the vehicle’s traction or to operate onboard electric auxiliaries. Furthermore, commercial fleet operators that connect eTrailer to a truck equipped with WABCO’s intelligent braking and stability control systems will further enhance the operating efficiency of the truck-trailer combination. WABCO estimates that its eTrailer could deliver fuel savings up to 20 percent on short haul routes and up to 10 percent for long hauls in a truck-trailer combination. 
Continuing on the path of electrification, in 2018, WABCO signed a MoU with Nidec Motor Corporation ("Nidec"), a subsidiary of Nidec Corporation, the world’s number one Comprehensive Motor Manufacturer (TSE: 6594) to define, develop, manufacture and commercialize fully integrated electric drivetrain and brake control solutions for longitudinal control of commercial vehicles. The fully integrated electric drivetrain solution will operate on vehicle control information received from driver inputs (use of accelerator and brake pedals) to automate decision flow on how to accelerate or decelerate the vehicle in the most prudent and economic way. By introducing advanced, fully integrated electric drivetrain solutions in this market segment, WABCO and Nidec will provide efficient energy management, while maintaining stable vehicle dynamics. Also, the electric drivetrain solution will enable improved energy recuperation across all use cases which will contribute to additional efficiency gains.

Manufacturing and Operations 
Most of our manufacturing sites and distribution centers produce and/or house a broad range of products and serve different types of customers. Currently, approximately 68% of our manufacturing workforce is located in best cost countries such as China, India, Brazil and Poland up from approximately 45% in 2007. Facilities in best cost countries have historically helped to reduce costs on more labor-intensive products, while our facilities in Western Europe are generally producing more technologically advanced products. However, the increasing need for more advanced products and systems in emerging markets leads us to expand local supply chain capabilities to progressively cover more complex manufacturing. 
All facilities worldwide are deploying Six Sigma Lean initiatives and global standards to continuously generate productivity and improve service levels. By applying Six Sigma policy, methodologies and tools, we seek to improve quality and predictability of our processes on a continual basis. Lean is geared toward eliminating waste in our supply chain, manufacturing and administrative processes. Methodologies are customer driven and data based. In addition, our global supply chain team is tightly connected throughout regions and at each site. They make decisions on where to manufacture each product taking into account factors such as local and export demand, customer approvals, cost, key supplier locations and factory capabilities. WABCO's global manufacturing and logistics also support our customers in the aftermarket as we continue to perform for on-time delivery and inventory fulfillment, among other drivers of customer satisfaction.
In 2018, WABCO opened a new Global Technology and Innovation Center in Hanover, Germany. Significantly expanding WABCO’s global product development and engineering capabilities, the nearly $30 million facility will play an important role in ensuring WABCO’s technology leadership is sustained through future generations of innovation within WABCO’s integrated network of product development and engineering centers that now spans four continents. This includes developing pioneering technologies to support the industry’s migration towards increasingly autonomous, connected and electric commercial vehicles.
Our global sourcing organization purchases a wide variety of components, including electrical, electro-mechanical and cast aluminum products, as well as parts containing materials such as steel, copper, rubber and plastic. These items represent a substantial portion of manufacturing costs. We source products on a global basis from three key regions: Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, and Asia. To support WABCO's continuing shift of manufacturing to best cost countries, we are migrating more of our sourcing to best cost regions. Under the leadership of the global sourcing organization, which is built around commodity and product groups, we identify and develop key suppliers and seek to integrate them as partners within our extended enterprise. Many of our Western European suppliers are accompanying us toward best cost countries. Since 2007, the share of our sourcing from best cost regions has increased from 36% to approximately 51%. 
We have developed a strong position in the engineering, design, development and testing of products, components and systems. We are generally regarded within our global industry as a systems expert. This recognition reflects our in-depth technical knowledge and capabilities to support the development of advanced technology applications that are appropriately and optimally integrated with all of the vehicle's other systems and controls. Key customers depend on us and will typically involve us very early in the development process as they begin designing next generation platforms. We have approximately 2,855 employees - of which approximately 55% are located in best cost countries - dedicated to engineering and developing new products, components and systems as well as supporting and enhancing technology applications and manufacturing processes. These include 331 software engineers in India who support the local design of new products and systems for emerging markets and contribute to the global development of advanced technologies for commercial vehicles. They are dedicated to continuously improving the cost effectiveness and efficiency of WABCO's business processes and operations worldwide through services that are optimally leveraged and shared within our own organization and connected with suppliers, customers and others. 
Our global sales organization hosts application engineers that are based near customers in different regions around the world and are partially resident at some customer locations. We also have significant resources in best cost countries where we perform functions such as drawing, testing and software component development. We operate test tracks in Germany and India as well as in Finland for extreme weather-proving conditions.

We review third-party intellectual property rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.
We own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to our products and technologies, and we have, from time to time, licensed some of our patents. Patents for individual products and processes extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. 
We protect our brands by trademark registrations in key markets in which our products are sold. Such trademark protections apply to our core WABCO brand as well as many of our product brand names. Our trademarks allow us to further distinguish our company and our products and are important in our relationships with customers, suppliers and partners.
While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. At the same time, we recognize that technical leadership is an ongoing pillar of success and our intellectual property portfolio will continue to grow in importance for the company as a whole as a result. We believe that the combination of our technology, patents, know-how and other intellectual property rights and assets creates an advantage for our business and we continue to focus on successful patent prosecution to build a strong patent portfolio, trademark protection and the exploitation and protection of other intellectual property rights in terms of our intellectual property, R&D and business strategies.
