ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 MicroVision is an automotive lidar and ADAS solutions company, focused on delivering safe mobility at the speed of life.
 
Founded in 1993, MicroVision, Inc. is a pioneer in laser beam scanning, or LBS, technology, which is based on our patented expertise in micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS, laser diodes, opto-mechanics, electronics, algorithms and software and how those elements are packaged into a small form factor. Throughout our history, we have combined our proprietary technology with our development expertise to create innovative solutions to address existing and emerging market needs, such as augmented reality microdisplay engines; interactive display modules; consumer lidar components; and, most recently, automotive lidar sensors and solutions for the automotive market.
 
Currently, our development efforts are primarily focused on automotive lidar sensors and an advanced driver-assisted systems, or ADAS, solution. Our integrated solution will combine our solid-state lidar sensor, custom ASICs, and software targeted for sale to automotive OEMs and Tier-1 automotive suppliers.
 
We believe that our MEMS-based lidar sensor demonstrates best-in-class features and performance that can exceed market expectations and outperform competitive products. In April 2021 we completed our A-Sample long range lidar module. During the third quarter of 2021, we tested our A-Sample hardware on an outdoor track and demonstrated the sensor’s key features at a significant trade show in Munich, Germany. We are continuing to develop our lidar sensor to improve and refine its features.
 
Our ADAS solution is intended to leverage edge computing and custom ASICs to enable our hardware and sensor fusion software to be integrated into an OEM’s ADAS stack. Our development efforts continue and we expect to test our solution and demonstrate its capabilities during the first half of 2022. Although we are forecasting small quantities of sales in 2022, we do not expect to achieve significant, sustained revenue from our ADAS solution in the near term.
 
In the recent past, we developed micro-display concepts and designs for use in head-mounted AR headsets and developed a 1440i MEMS module that can support AR headsets. We also developed a display solution targeted at the smart speakers market, which we call an Interactive Display module. The display was designed to project onto a countertop, tabletop or a wall from inside a smart speaker. The user could then touch the projected image on any surface on which the display is visible and it will behave like a touchscreen, as on a tablet or smartphone. In addition, we developed a small lidar sensor, which we call Consumer Lidar, for use indoors with smart home systems. It was designed to allow for a smart home system to understand what is happening in the home and then enable the smart home to respond in an appropriate way.

Although our development efforts are now solely focused on our ADAS solution, our revenue in the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 was derived from one customer, Microsoft Corporation, related to components that we developed for a high-definition display system. Our arrangement with this customer generates royalty income; however, the volume of sales and resulting royalties from that arrangement are not significant.
 
We have been unable to secure the customers needed to successfully launch our products. We have incurred substantial losses since inception, and we expect to incur a significant loss during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022.

Continuing Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
 
Our business operations continue to be impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Government restrictions in the early days of the pandemic caused us to mostly close our offices in early 2020. To support our hardware development efforts, we reopened our offices in July 2021 while maintaining compliance with government mandates and health agency protocols, including masking requirements and encouraging vaccination. Some of our office employees continue to work remotely or on hybrid schedules. We may experience reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines while our hybrid work policy remains in place, or if our employees become ill and are unable to work, which could have an adverse effect on the timing of our development activities. We will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees as we adapt our workplace policies based on evolving government regulation, health agency advice, and industry best practice.
 
In addition, particularly in connection with the recent resurgence of COVID-19 and its new variants, several of our suppliers have experienced closures or have been operating at reduced capacity, resulting in lower component availability. Continued disruptions to our supply chain could have a material impact on our future operations. Moreover, various global travel restrictions and office closures have hampered our business development efforts, making it more difficult to engage with potential customers and partners, which could have a material negative impact on our business prospects.
 
Our Industry and Market Strategy
 
We are developing our lidar sensors and sensor fusion software to address the needs of the Level 2+, or L2+, and Level 3, or L3, ADAS market. We estimate our serviceable addressable market for the period 2022 to 2030 to be approximately 100 million lidar sensors with a potential revenue opportunity of approximately $80 billion. These estimates assume one lidar sensor is required for each vehicle with L2+ functionality and two lidar sensors are required for each vehicle with L3 functionality, and that the average sales price per sensor is $800.
 
Our solution-based development approach recognizes two key realities of the L2+ and L3 markets: that safety is mission critical and that OEMs require cost efficiency and adaptability. With these factors in mind, we believe that our best-in-class lidar sensor supports critical safety needs by providing the highest resolution at range and velocity of moving objects with a dynamic field of view while running at 30 hertz, thus enabling ADAS features, such as automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, and automatic emergency steering, at higher speeds of operation than our competitors’ products. Moreover, we tailor our solution to meet the needs of OEMs, integrating our MEMS-based lidar and edge computing to support Highway Pilot capabilities up to 130km/h, save development cost and time for OEMs with no training required for our sensor-fused output, reduce system cost by requiring fewer and cheaper sensors and reduced processing, and enable seamless integration with an OEM’s existing architecture. Our unique solution for the L2+ and L3 markets, we believe, has the potential to achieve our goal of enabling mission-critical safety systems while solving for OEMs’ cost and integration objectives.
 
With this customer-centric approach, our go-to-market strategy depends on building partnerships with OEMs and Tier-1 automotive suppliers, as well as with silicon companies to support our solution on their compute platforms. Although we are working to establish direct marketing and co-development relationships with OEMs, we expect that our revenue will be derived directly from Tier-1 suppliers in the form of licensing revenue.

Our Technology and Competitive Strength
 
Core to our automotive lidar sensor, custom ASICs and software is proprietary technology that we have been developing, refining, productizing and protecting for nearly 30 years. Our patented LBS technology combines a MEMS scanning mirror, laser diode light sources, electronics, and optics that are controlled using our proprietary system control algorithms along with edge computing and machine learning in some systems. The MEMS scanning mirror is a key component of our technology system and is one of our core competencies. Our MEMS scanning mirror is a silicon device that oscillates in a precisely controlled closed loop pattern so that we can place a pixel of light at a precise point. This allows us to generate a projected image pixel-by-pixel for use in lidar sensing and display. Scanning modules with our technology can be designed to operate in one of three different modes: lidar sensing only, display and lidar sensing combined, and display only. For applications that include a projected display, our PicoP® scanning technology creates a brilliant, full color, high-contrast, uniform image over the entire field-of-view from a small and thin module with low power consumption. We believe that our proprietary technology offers significant advantages over other lidar sensing systems and traditional displays.
 
Early applications of our proprietary technology included heads up displays for the U.S. military and automotive systems. The contemplated uses of our technology require incorporation of our components into the products of other companies or partners. Most recently, our technology can be found in a Microsoft heads up display product. In the past, we have worked with other global brands to incorporate our core technology into their consumer products. We believe a significant competitive strength for us today is our long history of delivering LBS- and MEMS-based hardware and related firmware and software that meets reliability, predictability, and scalability standards of well-known OEMs and ODMs. 
 Our automotive lidar sensor is designed to, and we believe can meet or exceed OEM specifications, performing to 220 meters of range with an output resolution of 10.8 million points per second from a single return at 30 hertz. We believe that our hardware can deliver the highest point cloud density for a single-channel sensor as compared to competitive products. In addition to providing a low-latency, high-resolution point cloud at range, our sensor outputs axial, lateral, and vertical components of velocity of moving objects in the field of view at 30 hertz. This allows our solution to support a detailed understanding of the velocity of moving objects in real time, enabling fast and accurate path planning and maneuvering of the vehicle. Further, our proprietary scan locking feature ensures that our sensor is immune from interference from sunlight and from other lidar sensors. 
 In Augmented Reality (AR) applications, our technology enables high resolution of 1440i for large fields of view with low weight and low latency and persistence. Our Interactive Display gives an instant on and off, full color, focus-free, 720p projected image that is capable of responding as if it were a capacitance touch screen from any surface on which the projection can be seen. Our Consumer Lidar has a small size with high resolution, low power and low latency and is intended for use indoors to enable a smart home system to understand what is happening in the home and respond in an appropriate way.
 Revenue Strategy
 In 2019, our revenue was derived from the sale of components, from development contracts, and from royalty fees for LBS technology. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019 and through the end of February 2020, we were selling components to a high-definition display system that we developed for Microsoft under a development agreement. The volume and resulting revenue and gross profit from this business was fairly low. Therefore, in March 2020, we transferred production of the components to the customer. Starting in March 2020 and through 2021, we earned a royalty from the customer for each unit shipped, with amounts applied against the prepayment that we had previously received from the customer until the prepayment is exhausted. The value of the royalty is approximately equal to the amount of gross profit we would have earned if we continued to produce and ship the components. We believe this arrangement helps us conserve cash, while preserving our ability to experience financial benefits in the event the volume of components increases in the future.

Research and Development
 We believe our research and development efforts have earned us a leadership position in the field of LBS technology and applications as applied to consumer electronics, automotive and other markets. Our ability to attract customers and grow revenue will depend on our ability to maintain our LBS technology leadership, to continually improve performance, reduce costs, and reduce the size of component parts and scanning modules. Our research and development team is located in Redmond, Washington and as of December 31, 2021, was comprised of 67 engineering and technical staff in optics, software engineering, electrical engineering, product engineering, and MEMS design.
Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing approach is account based, business-to-business targeting of OEMs and ODMs. Our business development efforts are headed by executive management and business development representatives and are supported by engineers that assist customers during the design cycles of products. Our business development office for our automotive solution is located in Germany and our engineers are primarily located in Redmond, Washington. We engage potential customers directly, participate in trade shows, and maintain a website.
Manufacturing
 Although we are not manufacturing any products at this time,in the past, when we have produced products or components, our products were manufactured by a contract manufacturer based on our proprietary design, process, test, quality and reliability standards and incorporated our LBS technology and included MEMS and ASICs that were produced to order by semiconductor foundries. Our past manufacturing has not been subject to seasonal variations as our shipments have been relatively small and were in the early stages of product introduction. In the future, depending on our customers’ product mix, we may be affected by seasonal fluctuations which could affect working capital demands. Many of the raw materials used in our components are standard to the consumer electronics industry. Our MEMS, MEMS die, and ASICs have historically been manufactured to our specifications by separate single-source suppliers.
Competitive Conditions
 Many companies are attempting to develop lidar sensors and ADAS solutions; the competitive landscape is highly crowded and rapidly evolving. We compete with pureplay lidar developers, some of which have recently completed de-SPAC transactions raising significant capital. Some of these companies have announced partnerships with OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and contract manufacturers that, even if nonexclusive, may appear more credible than we do in the marketplace. We also face competition from OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers that have internally developed lidar sensors. All of these OEMs and Tier 1s are significantly larger, more well-resourced, have long operating histories and enjoy relevant brand recognition. Many lidar developers are also building ADAS solutions with which our solution would compete. Our competitors may succeed in developing innovative technologies and products that could render our technology or proposed products commercially infeasible or technologically obsolete.
 The lidar sensing and consumer display industries have been characterized by rapid and significant technological advances. Our LBS technology system and potential products may not be competitive with such advances, and we may not have sufficient funds to invest in new technologies, products or processes. Although we believe our technology system and proposed products could deliver higher performance and have other advantages, manufacturers of competing technologies may develop improvements to their technology that could reduce or eliminate the anticipated advantages of our proposed products.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 We create intellectual property from three sources: internal research and development activities, technology acquisitions, and performance on development contracts. The inventions covered by our patent applications generally relate to systems controls in our LBS technology, component miniaturization, power reduction, feature enhancements, specific implementation of various system components, and design elements to facilitate mass production. Protecting these key-enabling technologies and components is a fundamental aspect of our strategy to penetrate diverse markets with unique products. As such, we intend to continue to develop our portfolio of proprietary and patented LBS technologies at the system, component, and process levels.

We believe our extensive patent portfolio is the largest, broadest, and earliest filed LBS technology portfolio. We currently have over 430 issued patents and pending patents worldwide. As our technology develops, we periodically review our patent portfolio and eliminate patents that are deemed of low value.  Due to this ongoing portfolio management practice, the number of patents in our portfolio will vary at any given time.
 Since our inception in 1993, we have acquired through portfolio purchases, patents that grant us exclusive rights to various LBS technologies. From time to time some of these patents may expire or be abandoned to better utilize resources expended to maintain and generate new intellectual property.
 Our ability to compete effectively in automotive lidar or any other market we may enter may depend, in part, on our ability and the ability of our licensors to maintain the proprietary nature of these technologies.
 We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. To protect our rights in these areas, we require all employees, and where appropriate, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators, to enter into confidentiality and non-compete agreements. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information.
 We have registered the name “PicoP®” and “MicroVision®” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

Our Employees, People Operations and Workplace Safety
 As of February 25, 2022, we had approximately 96 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
 
Our principal human capital objectives are to attract, retain, motivate, and reward our employees to achieve results for our customers and us. To achieve these objectives, our human capital programs seek to (i) support skill building and prepare our employees for advancement through continuous learning, (ii) reward our employees through compensation awards and resources intended to motivate our employees and promote well-being and (iii) continuously identify opportunities for development through regular employee input and engagement. We offer competitive compensation and benefits.
 
We also strive for continuous improvement in diversity and inclusivity among our employees, management, and board of directors, and seek to promote job opportunities to a diverse pool of qualified candidates. We are also committed to providing an inclusive work environment free of discrimination or harassment of any kind, supported by policies, communications, and reporting and resolution resources.
 
Protecting the safety, health, and well-being of our employees is also a key priority. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on the health and safety of our employees by implementing appropriate safety protocols. We have implemented work-from-home procedures where possible, required the wearing of masks and physical distancing on the job when called for by local guidelines, and increased cleaning procedures and provided cleaning supplies.
 
We work with third party independent experts in the field of laser safety to assist in meeting safety specifications. In addition, we monitor developments in the area of permissible laser exposure limits as established by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and others. Independent experts have concluded that laser exposure to the eye resulting from use of LBS devices under normal operating conditions would be below the calculated maximum permissible exposure level set by the IEC.
