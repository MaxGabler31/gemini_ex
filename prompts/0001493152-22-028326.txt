About Tersus Power, Inc.
 
Tersus Power Inc. was founded in 2020 as a contract manufacturer that will build and deliver Modular Hydrogen Fueling stations across the U.S and Canada. Tersus Power is located in Nevada and is in the process of commissioning a facility to manufacture the initial prototypes, and then ramp up to manufacture 10 modular fueling stations per month. The Company’s manufacturing facility will be located in the Pittsburgh, PA metroplex.
 
Tersus Power bases its Gen3 Modular Hydrogen Fueling Station on the PowerTap PT50, which was originally developed and manufactured by Nuvera in cooperation with the Department of Energy. Tersus Power’s next generation modular Hydrogen fueling station will utilize the patented solutions developed by Nuvera and the Department of Energy and will generate up to 1250 Kg of pure Hydrogen daily.
 
Tersus Power’s sole objective is to design a safe, adaptable and affordable hydrogen fueling station that allows for rapid development and deployment of hydrogen fueling infrastructure while minimizing the risk to investors. The Company’s modular prefabricated fueling stations could be produced on a very large scale and available immediately for delivery to participating sites in order to meet the growing demand for hydrogen fuel. The success of these stations will build increased confidence in the hydrogen vehicle market for both consumers and investors.
 
The station production equipment will be housed in a modular steel-hardened exoskeleton platform similar to a 40-foot shipping container, depending on the production requirements for a given site. The platform would contain a fully operational hydrogen production system. Each fueling station will be preassembled and rigorously tested in Tersus Power’s manufacturing facility to ensure minimum configuration at time of delivery. The design enhanced side panels that cover the structure will give it a permanent look and feel while providing further stability to the structure as a whole. The panels will be removable to provide access to production equipment for the purposes of maintenance and repair.
 
The modular fueling station will be placed on site at existing fueling stations on a prepared concrete pad that could support a more permanent installation. This approach allows for a narrowly focused permitting process which is necessary to connect the modular fueling stations to on-site utilities supporting the production of hydrogen. This approach eliminates the costly need to transport hydrogen from large-scale “refineries” to fueling stations.
 
Tersus Power generated over $2 million in revenue during 2021 by providing engineering services contracts in the hydrogen industry. There are no guarantees that the proposed transaction will close.

Potential Future Acquisitions
 
In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another company or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon consummation of a transaction, it is probable that our present management and stockholders will no longer be in control of us. In addition, our sole director may, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by new directors without a vote of our stockholders, or sell his stock in us. Any such sale will only be made in compliance with the securities laws of the United States and any applicable state.
 
It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such acquisition would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under application federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, as a negotiated element of the transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after it has successfully consummated a merger or acquisition and is no longer considered an inactive company.
 
The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on the value of our securities in the future. There is no assurance that such a trading market will develop.
 
While the actual terms of a transaction cannot be predicted, it is expected that the parties to any business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the business transaction in a so-called “tax-free” reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). In order to obtain tax-free treatment under the Code, it may be necessary for the owner of the acquired business to own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such event, our stockholders would retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This would result in significant dilution in the equity of our stockholders.
 
As part of our investigation, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of both parties, and the management of the opportunity.
 
With respect to any merger or acquisition, and depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities, our stockholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in us following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with assets and expectations of growth. Any merger or acquisition can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our stockholders.
 
We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written business agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally we anticipate that such agreements will (i) require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties; (ii) specify certain events of default; (iii) detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing; (iv) outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with the Company’s attorneys and accountants; (v) set forth remedies on defaults; and (vi) include miscellaneous other terms.

As stated above, we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to ensure our compliance within the requirements of the 1934 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by that business to be acquired, the definitive closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the definitive closing documents will also contain a provision providing for reimbursement for our costs associated with the proposed transaction.
 
There are no guarantees that we will be successful in Closing any additional acquisitions or mergers.
 
Competition
 
We believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms, which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
 
In reference to our subsidiary 911 Help Now (“911”), the Personal Emergency Response marketplace is a large and fragmented market, which has many competitors with larger financial resources than us. Our differentiating factor in this space is our no monthly fee sales model. At present, we own no intellectual property within our 911 subsidiary. In order to generate future revenue within 911, we will need to identify and either acquire or license intellectual property. In the event of an acquisition, we will then need to either develop products utilizing our intellectual property or license out our intellectual property to a third party. There is no guarantee that we will be successful with an acquisition or licensing of any intellectual property.
 
In reference to our subsidiary HMNRTH (“HMNRTH”), the market for the sale of CBD-based products is fragmented and intensely competitive. Currently, in the United States, we do not believe that there are any businesses that can demonstrate or claim a dominant market share of the growing CBD products market. Our competitors in the retail location sales of CBD-based products include Green Roads, PlusCBD, and Select CBD, and in the digital space include Diamond CBD, CBDistillery, and Lazarus Natural. We expect that the quantity and composition of the competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures and new customers enter the marketplace. In order for the Company to generate revenue through HMNRTH, we will need to: (i) produce additional inventory for retail sales through the Company’s ecommerce site or sales, or (ii) sales to third party distributors, or (iii) direct sales to brick and mortar CBD retail outlets, or (iv) generate additional CBD formulas to be utilized in new products At present, the Company does not have the required capital to move forward with any of the options and there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise the required funds.
 
In reference to our newly formed business operation through our subsidiary Markets on Main (“MOM”), the Company’s goal is to become a leader in sales and distribution of entrepreneur driven products, in a highly competitive industry. We compete with companies from all industries, some of which have substantially more resources, stronger name recognition, and longer operating histories than us, and which benefit from greater economies of scale.
 
We target products that leverage some sort of intellectual property that we may own or license from the entrepreneurs. Under the Company’s business plan, we anticipate that certain of our licensors will have reserved the right to manufacture, distribute and sell similar or identical products. Some of these products could directly compete with our products and could be sold to our customers or directly to consumers at lower prices than those at which our products are sold. Our competitors for MOM include Funko, Inc. and Edison Nation, Inc. to name a few. We anticipate generating revenue through MOM during the current fiscal quarter through our fulfillment relationships with QVC and TBD Safety.
 
Investment Company Act 1940
 
Although we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the 1934 Act, we believe we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event we engage in business combinations that result in us holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company and incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the 1940 Act and, consequently, any violation of the 1940 Act would subject us to material adverse consequences. We believe that, currently, we are exempt under Regulation 3a-2 of the 1940 Act.
