ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 MIC is a Delaware corporation formed on May 21, 2015. MICs predecessor, Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC, was formed on April 13, 2004. Except as otherwise specified, all references in this Form 10-K to MIC, we, us, and our refer to Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
 MIC Level Strategy 
 We own, operate and intend to expand our portfolio of infrastructure and infrastructure-like businesses with the objective of increasing the amount of Free Cash Flow generated by these businesses over time. Currently, we are focused on three priorities in pursuit of this strategy:

1. | Investing in high-value, long-lived physical assets and extending the duration of revenue generating contracts or concessions;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Prudently managing our financial resources by pursuing projects with returns appropriately in excess of our cost of capital that are expected to increase the cash generating capacity of our businesses over the long term; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Enhancing our financial strength and flexibility by maintaining an appropriate level of debt relative to the cash generating capacity of our businesses and by optimizing the cost and tenor of such debt.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect these efforts will, collectively, produce growth in the amount of cash generated by our businesses consistent with maintaining the highest level of environmental, health and safety and governance standards. 
 General 
 We currently own and operate a portfolio of businesses that provide services to other businesses, government agencies and individuals primarily in the U.S. The businesses we own and operate are organized into four segments:

 | International-Matex Tank Terminals (IMTT): a business providing bulk liquid terminalling services to third parties at 17 terminals in the U.S. and two in Canada; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Atlantic Aviation: a provider of fuel, terminal, aircraft hangaring and other services primarily to owners and operators of general aviation (GA) jet aircraft at 70 airports throughout the U.S.; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | MIC Hawaii: comprising an energy company that processes and distributes gas and provides related services (Hawaii Gas) and several smaller businesses collectively engaged in efforts to reduce the cost and improve the reliability and sustainability of energy in Hawaii; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Corporate and Other: comprised of MIC Corporate (holding company), our shared services center and other smaller businesses. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Effective October 1, 2018, the Bayonne Energy Center (BEC) and substantially all of our portfolio of solar and wind power generation businesses were classified as discontinued operations and our Contracted Power segment was eliminated. The remaining renewable power development businesses have been reported as components of Corporate and Other. All prior comparable periods have been restated to reflect this change. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Recent Developments for further discussions.

We buy, develop and invest in the growth of our businesses based on a general assumption that we will own them indefinitely. It is neither our intent nor our expectation that we will divest of a business at a particular point in our ownership or as a result of having achieved certain targets, financial or otherwise. This view of ownership as a long-term relationship does not preclude sales of all or portions of businesses when we believe that we have either maximized the amount of value in the asset relative to our capability, or the asset is more highly valued by another owner. We may, depending on our ability to access additional debt or equity capital on what we consider attractive terms, sell businesses or assets to generate capital for reinvestment in new or existing businesses at what we believe could be improved returns. With respect to new

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 developments, sales of these assets may occur more opportunistically. In general, we have redeployed the proceeds from asset sales in the development of our remaining businesses either through investment in growth projects or acquisitions of small, bolt-on operations consistent with our view of MIC as a long-term owner. 
 Managing the deployment of growth capital effectively has been and is expected to continue to be an important part of our strategy and the creation of stockholder value. Our sources of growth capital include the retained capital generated by our businesses but not distributed as a cash dividend to our stockholders, capital generated through the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities, or the proceeds from the sale of entire or portions of certain businesses. Over time, we expect to deploy growth capital of $300.0 million to $350.0 million per year in projects and bolt-on acquisitions across all of our businesses. Importantly, although we find value in diversification and the generally uncorrelated nature of the businesses in our current portfolio, we are not obligated to invest in the growth of any one business or segment or the addition of any new segment. We currently expect that, given the relative size of the business, the attractiveness of available opportunities and the tax benefits associated with investing in high-value, physical-asset backed opportunities, a disproportionate share of the growth capital we deploy over the near term will be deployed into projects at IMTT. 
 Equally important, we seek to drive stockholder value by focusing on business performance improvement. These efforts include upgrading systems and technology, implementing data analytics tools, developing cross business efficiencies and deploying enterprise-wide procurement strategies among others. In 2017, we formed MIC Global Services (MGS), a new entity into which we have consolidated support functions across all of our businesses. We believe that MGS will generate significant savings relative to the cost of maintaining these functions separately in each of our operating companies. A majority of the costs associated with the operation of MGS are allocated to our operating companies. Any unallocated MGS costs are reported as a component of our Corporate and Other segment. 
 Businesses 
 Our businesses, in general, are defined by a combination of the following characteristics:
 
 | ownership of long-lived, high-value physical assets that are difficult to replicate or substitute for;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | as a platform for the deployment of growth capital;
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | broadly consistent demand for their services over the longer term;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | relatively high operational leverage, such that increases in top-line growth can generate larger increases in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the provision of basic, often essential services;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | generally predictable maintenance capital expenditure requirements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | generally favorable competitive positions, largely due to high barriers to entry, including:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | high initial development and construction costs;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | difficulty in obtaining suitable land on which to operate;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | high costs of customer switching;
--+----------------------------------


 | long-term concessions, leases or customer contracts; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | lack of immediate, cost-effective alternatives for the services provided.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The different businesses that comprise our Company exhibit these above characteristics to different degrees at different times. For example, a more macro-economically correlated business like Atlantic Aviation may exhibit more volatility during periods of economic downturn than businesses with substantially contracted revenue streams. While not every business we own will meet all of the general criteria described above, we seek to own a diversified portfolio of businesses that possesses a balance of these characteristics. 
 In addition to the benefits associated with these characteristics, net margins generated by most of our businesses tend to keep pace with historically normal rates of inflation. The price escalators built into many

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 customer contracts, and the inflation and cost pass-through adjustments that are typically included in pricing, serve to insulate our businesses to a significant degree from the negative effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations. 
Our Manager 
 We are a party to a Management Services Agreement with Macquarie Infrastructure Management (USA) Inc. (Manager). Our Manager is a member of the Macquarie Group, a diversified international provider of financial, advisory and investment services. The Macquarie Group is headquartered in Sydney, Australia and is a global leader in the management of infrastructure investment vehicles on behalf of third-party investors and an advisor on the acquisition, disposition and financing of infrastructure assets. 
 Effective November 1, 2018, our Manager waived two portions of the base management fee to which it is entitled under the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Management Services Agreement (Management Service Agreement). Our Manager reserves the right to revoke the waivers and revert to the prior terms of the agreement, subject to providing the Company with not less than a one year notice. We pay our Manager a monthly base management fee of 1% of our equity market capitalization less any cash balances at the holding company. For this, in accordance with the Management Services Agreement, the Manager provides normal ongoing corporate center functions such as facilities, technology, employee benefits and access to services including human resources, legal, finance, tax and accounting among others. Our Manager is responsible for and oversees the management of our operating businesses, subject to the oversight and supervision of our board of directors. Our Manager compensates and has assigned, or seconded, to us employees to serve as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer on a full-time basis. It also compensates and seconds, or makes available, other personnel as required. MIC has no employees at the holding company level. 
 Our Manager may also earn a performance fee if the quarterly total return (capital appreciation plus dividends) for our stockholders is positive and exceeds the quarterly total return of a U.S. utilities index benchmark both in the quarter and cumulatively. If payable, the performance fee is equal to 20% of the difference between the benchmark return and the total return for our stockholders during the quarter. Per the terms of the Management Services Agreement, our Manager currently reinvests any base management or performance fees in new primary shares of the Company. The Manager may elect to receive either base management or performance fees, if any, in cash but may only change its election during a 20 trading day window following our earnings release. Any change would apply to fees to which it was entitled thereafter. 
 Our Businesses 
 Use of Non-GAAP measures 
 In addition to our results under U.S. GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures to assess the performance and prospects of our businesses. In particular, we use EBITDA excluding non-cash items, Free Cash Flow and certain proportionately combined financial metrics. Proportionately combined financial metrics reflect our proportionate interest in our solar and wind facilities, substantially all of which are in discontinued operations. 
 We measure EBITDA excluding non-cash items as it reflects our businesses ability to effectively manage the volume of products sold or services provided, the operating margin earned on those transactions and the management of operating expenses independent of the capitalization and tax attributes of those businesses. 
 In analyzing the financial performance of our businesses, we focus primarily on cash generation and Free Cash Flow in particular. We believe investors use Free Cash Flow as a measure of our ability to sustain and potentially increase our quarterly cash dividend and to fund a portion of our growth.

IMTT 
 Industry Overview 
 Bulk liquid terminals provide important infrastructure in the supply chain for a broad range of liquid commodities (see below). Bulk liquid terminals provide vital logistics services to oil producers and marketers, refiners, chemical manufacturers, food processors and commodity traders. Customers typically pay terminal operators such as IMTT on an availability or take or pay basis to provide tank capacity, loading and unloading access, and pipeline and trans-loading capacity, and also pay additional fees for ancillary services such as heating, blending and packaging. 
 A number of factors influence demand for bulk liquid terminals in the U.S. Demand for storage rises and falls according to local and regional consumption. In addition, import and export activity accounts for a material portion of the business. Shippers require storage for the staging, aggregation and/or distribution of products before and after transport. The extent of import/export activity depends on macroeconomic factors, such as currency fluctuations, as well as industry-specific conditions, such as supply and demand imbalances in different geographic regions. Demand for storage is also driven by fluctuations in the current and perceived future price and demand for the product being stored and the resulting temporal price arbitrage. 
 Potential entrants into the bulk liquid terminals business face several barriers. Strict environmental regulations, availability of suitable land with connectivity to pipeline and transport logistics, including marine, road and rail infrastructure, local community resistance and initial investment costs may limit the construction of new bulk liquid terminals. These barriers are typically higher around waterways near major urban centers. As a consequence, new tanks are generally built where existing docks, pipelines and other infrastructure can support them. However, restrictions on land use, difficulties in securing environmental permits, and the potential for operational bottlenecks due to constraints on related infrastructure may limit the ability of existing terminals to expand the storage capacity of their facilities. 
 Business Overview 
 IMTT is one of the largest providers of independent, or third-party, bulk liquid terminal services in the U.S., based on capacity. IMTT handles products consumed by a diverse range of users in both domestic and foreign markets. IMTT stores or handles primarily refined petroleum products, various commodity and specialty chemicals, renewable fuels and vegetable and tropical oils (collectively liquid commodities). Crude oil constitutes an immaterial portion of IMTTs overall storage and handling operations. The business operates 19 terminals including 17 in the U.S. and two in Canada (one partially owned) with principal operations in the New York Harbor market and on the Lower Mississippi River. 
 Since our initial investment in IMTT in May 2006, we have deployed capital in the growth and development of additional storage capacity, facilities and related infrastructure (pipes, pumps, docks, etc.) and acquisitions of facilities in Illinois and a portfolio of terminals primarily in the U.S. Southeast. Consistent with IMTTs strategy below, we expect to be able to continue to deploy capital in the growth and expansion of storage capacity and capabilities and to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.

Locations 
 As of December 31, 2018, IMTT comprised the following facilities and storage capacity, not including tanks used in packaging, recovery tanks, and/or other storage capacity not typically leased. 

Facility | Land | | Aggregate Capacity of Storage Tanks in Service (Millions of Barrels) | Percent of Ownership
Facilities in the United States: | | | | | | | 
Lower Mississippi River Terminals (4) | | Owned | | | 20.6 | 100.0 | %
Bayonne Terminal | | Owned | | | 15.8 | 100.0 | %
Other Terminals (12) | | Owned | | | 6.9 | 100.0 | %
Facilities in Canada: | | | | | | | 
Quebec City, Quebec | | Leased | | | 2.0 | 100.0 | %
Placentia Bay, Newfoundland | | Leased | | | 3.0 | 20.1 | %
Total | | | | | 48.3 | | 

 IMTT facilities generally operate 24 hours a day providing customers with prompt access to a wide range of logistical services. In each of its two key markets, IMTTs scale ensures availability of sophisticated product handling capabilities. IMTT continuously improves speed and flexibility of operations at its facilities by investing in upgrades of its docks, pipelines and pumping infrastructure and facility management systems. 
 Lower Mississippi River Terminals (48% of gross profit) 
 On the Lower Mississippi River, IMTT currently operates four terminals (St. Rose, Gretna, Avondale and Geismar). With combined storage capacity of 20.6 million barrels, the four sites give IMTT substantial market share in the storage and handling of refined petroleum products, bulk liquid chemicals, vegetable and tropical oils on the strategically important Lower Mississippi River. These terminals serve a predominantly import/export market.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 IMTT  (continued) 
 The Lower Mississippi River facilities also give IMTT a substantial presence in a key domestic transport hub. The Lower Mississippi River serves as a major transshipment point for agricultural products (such as vegetable and tropical oils) and commodity chemicals (such as methanol) between the central U.S. and the rest of the world. The region also has substantial traffic related to the petroleum industry. Lower Mississippi River refiners and traders send products to other regions of the U.S. and overseas and use IMTTs Lower Mississippi River facilities to provide aggregation and transshipment services. The Lower Mississippi River facilities also serve as an aggregation point for feedstocks prior to being utilized by refinery and chemical plant processing units located nearby. These facilities enjoy relatively unencumbered marine and road access when compared to other, more congested waterways such as the Houston Ship Channel. 
 Bayonne Terminal (37% of gross profit) 
 Located on the Kill Van Kull between New Jersey and Staten Island, New York, the 15.8 million barrel capacity IMTT-Bayonne Terminal occupies an attractive position in New York Harbor where it has substantial market share. New York Harbor serves as the main petroleum distribution hub in the northeast U.S. and a physical settlement site for certain futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). In addition to waterborne shipments, products reach New York Harbor through petroleum product pipelines including the Colonial Pipeline which originates in Houston, Texas. Pipelines also move imports and exports of refined petroleum product to and from New York Harbor and various inland markets. With connections to the Colonial, Buckeye and Harbor refined petroleum product pipelines, as well as rail and road connectivity and blending capabilities, the IMTT-Bayonne Terminal provides its customers with considerable logistical and commercial flexibility. 
 IMTT-Bayonne has the capability to quickly load and unload the largest bulk liquid transport ships entering New York Harbor which is an important competitive advantage. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has dredged the Kill Van Kull channel passing the IMTT-Bayonne docks to 50 feet. IMTT has dredged two of its docks to 47 feet, allowing large vessels to dock, load and unload products. Most of IMTTs competitors in New York Harbor have facilities located on the southern portion of the Arthur Kill (water depth of approximately 37 feet), and large ships must transfer a portion of their cargoes to barges before docking (a process known as lightering). Lightering increases the cost and time associated with loading and unloading.

Competition 
 The competitive environment in which IMTT operates varies by terminal location and product. The principal competition for each of IMTTs facilities comes from other bulk liquid terminals located in the same regional market. Secondary competition for IMTTs facilities comes from bulk liquid terminals located in the same broad geographic region as IMTTs terminals. For example, IMTTs Lower Mississippi River facilities indirectly compete with bulk liquid terminals located on the Houston Ship Channel. 
 Independent terminal operators generally compete on the basis of the location, connectivity and versatility of facilities, service and price. The services typically provided by the terminal include, among other things, the safe storage of the product at specified temperature, moisture and other conditions, as well as receipt and delivery from the terminal, all of which must be in compliance with applicable environmental regulations. A terminal with a favorable location will have access to a variety of cost-effective transportation modes, both to and from the terminal. Transportation modes typically include waterways, railroads, roadways and pipelines. A terminal operators ability to obtain attractive prices is often dependent on the quality, versatility and reputation of its facilities. 
 IMTT faces significant competition from a variety of international, national and regional energy companies, including large, diversified midstream entities, global terminal operators and large multi-national energy companies. We believe that IMTT is favorably positioned to compete in the industry due to the strategic location of terminals on the Gulf Coast and in New York Harbor and certain secondary markets, its reputation, the prices charged for its services and the connectivity, quality and versatility of those services. In particular, we believe that IMTTs proximity to petroleum refineries and chemical plants in both of its key markets and to the very substantial end use market in the Northeast are sources of competitive advantage and provide diversity in our revenue.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 IMTT  (continued) 
 As noted above, we believe that significant barriers to entry exist in the terminalling business. These barriers include significant capital requirements and execution risk, a lengthy permitting and development cycle, financing challenges, a finite number of sites suitable for development, operating expertise and customer relationships. 
Customers 
 IMTT provides bulk liquid terminalling services primarily to oil refiners and marketers, chemical manufacturers, food processors and commodity traders. These customers, in turn, serve a range of end users in both domestic and foreign markets. Within its terminals, IMTT has the ability to repurpose tanks and related infrastructure for various bulk liquid products both to respond to and to anticipate changes in customer demand. IMTT does not depend on a single customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on IMTT. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 50% of IMTTs revenue was generated by its top ten customers, of which eight were rated investment grade and two were not rated. Customers typically sign contracts which, among other things, provide for a fixed periodic payment (usually monthly) for access to and use of IMTTs facilities. These payments may be expressed in terms of cents per barrel of capacity, a dollar amount per unit of infrastructure, or a dollar amount per month. These amounts are payable whether the customer uses the facilities and services or not and does not include additional charges for throughput or ancillary services. In 2018, approximately 80% of IMTTs revenues were generated from these availability style payments. 
 IMTT is responsible for exercising appropriate care of the products stored at its facilities and believes it maintains adequate insurance with respect to its exposure. IMTT does not have direct material exposure to short-term commodity price fluctuations because it typically does not purchase or market the products that it handles. IMTTs customers retain title to products stored and have responsibility for securing insurance or self-insuring against loss or fluctuation in value. 
 Regulation 
 The rates that IMTT charges for its services are not subject to regulation. However, a number of regulatory agencies, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Department of Transportation, Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard, regulate IMTTs operations. IMTT must comply with numerous federal, state and local environmental, occupational health and safety, security, tax and planning statutes and regulations. These regulations require IMTT to obtain and maintain permits to operate its facilities and impose standards that govern the way IMTT operates its business. If IMTT does not comply with the relevant regulations, it could lose its operating permits and/or incur fines and increased liability. While changes in environmental, health and safety regulations pose a risk of higher operating costs, such changes are generally phased in over time to manage the impact on both the industry and the business. 
 Few of IMTTs facilities require significant environmental remediation. Those that do have such efforts overseen by various state and federal agencies. Remediation efforts entail removal of the free product, groundwater control and treatment, soil treatment, repair/replacement of sewer systems, and the implementation of containment and monitoring systems. These remediation activities are expected to continue for an additional ten to twenty years, or more. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3, for further discussions. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, IMTT (excluding the Newfoundland terminal) had a total of 917 employees, of which 274 employees were unionized. We believe relations with both union and non-union employees at IMTT are generally good.

The day-to-day operations of IMTT are managed by individual terminal managers who are responsible for most aspects of the operations. IMTTs operations are overseen by senior personnel with significant experience in the bulk liquid terminals industry. Management of the business is headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Atlantic Aviation 
 Industry Overview 
 Fixed based operations (FBOs) primarily service the GA segment of the air transportation industry. Local airport authorities own the airport properties and grant FBO operators a long-term ground lease that includes the right to provide fueling and other services. Fueling services provide the majority of an FBOs revenue and gross margin. 
 FBOs often operate in environments with high barriers to entry. Airports tend to have limited physical space for additional FBOs and airport authorities generally do not have an incentive to add FBOs unless there is a significant demand for services that cannot be met by the existing FBO at the airport. Development of a new FBO requires securing airport approvals, completing the design and construction and may involve substantial time and capital. Furthermore, airports typically impose minimum standards with respect to the experience, capital investment and breadth of services provided by the FBO. 
 The ownership of FBOs in the U.S. is highly fragmented with the majority of facilities individually owned and operated rather than part of networks. Consolidation has been and is expected to continue to be an important feature of the industry as larger networks are able to achieve economies of scale in fuel and insurance purchasing, marketing and back office operations compared with individual owners/operators. 
 Demand for FBO services is driven by the level of GA flight activity which is defined as the number of take-offs and landings in a given period. We believe GA flight activity will continue to expand at rates broadly consistent with overall economic activity in the U.S. 
 Business Overview 
 At December 31, 2018, Atlantic Aviation operated FBOs at 70 airports in the U.S. Atlantic Aviations FBOs provide fuel, terminal, aircraft hangaring and other services primarily to owners/operators of GA aircraft, but also to commercial, military, freight and government aviation customers. 
 Atlantic Aviation has been a part of the MIC portfolio since our IPO. In December 2004, the business owned and operated a total of 16 FBOs. Through a roll-up of FBOs, we have increased the size of the network to a total of 70 facilities. Consistent with our strategy of seeking to optimize the portfolio, we have exited markets we believe have limited growth potential in favor of entering those with better prospects. Since our IPO, we have deployed capital in Atlantic Aviation in the acquisition of FBOs and projects including the construction of terminals and aircraft hangars, fuel tank farms, aircraft parking (ramps) and a range of smaller projects.

 Atlantic Aviation  (continued) 
 Operations 
 Atlantic Aviation operates high-quality facilities and focuses on attracting customers who desire personalized service. Fuel sales generated 60% of gross margin in 2018. Other services, including de-icing, aircraft parking and hangar rental, aircraft cleaning and catering provided the balance. Fuel is stored in tank farms owned either by Atlantic Aviation or by the airport and Atlantic Aviation operates owned or leased refueling vehicles to move fuel from the tank farms to the aircraft being serviced. At some of Atlantic Aviations locations, services are also provided to commercial airlines, freight operators, and military and government users. Services provided to the airlines may include refueling from the airlines own fuel supplies, de-icing and/or ground and ramp handling services. 
 Atlantic Aviation buys fuel at a wholesale price and sells fuel to customers either at a contracted price, or at a price negotiated at the point of purchase. While wholesale fuel costs can vary, Atlantic Aviation generally passes changes in fuel costs through to customers and seeks to maintain and, when possible, increase its dollar-based margin per gallon. In general, the business has minimal exposure to commodity price fluctuations as it carries a limited inventory of jet fuel. 
 Atlantic Aviation is focused on managing costs effectively and continuously evaluates opportunities to reduce expenses. Such opportunities may include business reengineering, more efficient purchasing, partnering with service providers and/or capturing synergies in acquisitions. 
 Locations 
 Atlantic Aviations FBOs operate pursuant to long-term leases from the airport authorities who own or manage the airport. Atlantic Aviation works with these airport authorities to optimize lease lengths through capital improvements or other enhancements to the airport. 
 Atlantic Aviations EBITDA-weighted average remaining lease length (including leases extendable at Atlantic Aviations sole discretion) was 19.9 years and 20.3 years at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The leases at nine of Atlantic Aviations FBOs, collectively accounting for approximately 15.0% of Atlantic Aviations gross margin, are expected to be renegotiated and extended within the next five years. No individual FBO generated more than 10% of Atlantic Aviations gross margin at December 31, 2018. 
 The airport authorities have certain termination rights in each of Atlantic Aviations leases of the FBO. Standard terms allow for termination if Atlantic Aviation defaults on the terms and conditions of the lease, abandons the property or becomes insolvent or bankrupt. Most of the leases allow for termination if liens are filed against the property. Leases related to fewer than twenty out of the 70 FBOs may be terminated for convenience or other similar reasons. In these cases, generally, there are compensation agreements based on amortization schedules or obligations of the airport authority to make best efforts to relocate the FBO. 
 Atlantic Aviation periodically evaluates its portfolio of FBOs and occasionally concludes that some of its sites do not have sufficient scale or do not serve a market with sufficiently strong growth prospects to warrant continued operations at these locations. In these cases, it may elect to sell the site or not renew the lease upon maturity.

Marketing 
 Atlantic Aviation has a number of marketing programs, each utilizing an internally-developed point-of-sale system that tracks GA flight movements. This program supports flight tracking and provides customer relationship management data that facilitates up-selling of fuel and optimization of revenue per customer. 
 Atlantic Aviation also maintains a loyalty program for pilots known as Atlantic Awards that provides an incentive to purchase fuel from Atlantic Aviation. These awards are recorded as a reduction in revenue in Atlantic Aviations consolidated financial statements.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Atlantic Aviation  (continued) 
 Competition 
 Atlantic Aviation competes with other FBO operators at more than half of its locations, and its facilities may also face indirect competition from FBOs located at nearby airports. The FBOs compete on the basis of location of the facility relative to runways and street access, service, safety, value-added features, reliability and price. Each FBO also faces competitive pressure from the fact that aircraft may take on sufficient fuel at one location and not need to refuel at a specific destination. 
 Atlantic Aviations main competitors are Signature Flight Support, Jet Aviation, Million Air, Sheltair Aviation and TAC Air. To our knowledge, other than certain of the competitors listed, no competitor operated more than 20 FBOs in the U.S. at December 31, 2018.

 Atlantic Aviation does not depend on a single customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business. 
 Regulation 
 The aviation industry is overseen by a number of regulatory agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency, but its primary regulator is the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In addition, local airport authorities also regulate FBOs. The business must comply with federal, state and local environmental statutes and regulations associated in part with the operation of fuel storage tank systems and mobile fueling vehicles. These requirements include tank and pipe testing for tightness, soil sampling for evidence of leaking and remediation of detected leaks and spills. 
 Atlantic Aviations FBOs are subject to regular inspection by federal and local environmental agencies as well as local fire departments and other agencies. The business does not expect that compliance and related remediation work, if any, will have a material negative impact on earnings or the competitive position of Atlantic Aviation. The business has not received notice requiring it to cease operations at any location or of any abatement proceeding by any government agency as a result of failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, the business employed 1,924 people, of which 203 employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe relations with both union and non-union employees at Atlantic Aviation are generally good. 
 The day-to-day operations of Atlantic Aviation are managed by individual site managers who are responsible for most aspects of the operations at their site. Atlantic Aviations operations are overseen by senior personnel with significant experience in the aviation industry. 
 MIC Hawaii 
 Industry Overview 
 According to the Energy Information Administration, energy consumption in Hawaii is split approximately equally between the transportation market and the industrial/commercial/residential markets. Gas holds approximately 2% share of the Hawaii energy market and serves primarily the residential and commercial markets with applications including water heating, drying, cooking, emergency power generation and other select uses. 
 Beginning in 2008 with the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative, the State of Hawaii embarked on a program to be a leader in the development and deployment of clean energy solutions. MIC Hawaii has invested in multiple clean energy projects including the recent commissioning of a renewable natural gas facility that captures and purifies wastewater biogas for injection into the Hawaii Gas utility pipeline on Oahu. MIC Hawaii expects to pursue additional growth opportunities in line with Hawaiis clean energy goals.

 MIC Hawaii  (continued) 
 Business Overview 
 MIC Hawaii comprises Hawaii Gas and several smaller businesses collectively engaged in efforts to reduce the cost and improve the reliability and sustainability of energy in Hawaii. From 2006 to 2015, our MIC Hawaii segment consisted solely of Hawaii Gas, a combination of Hawaiis only government-franchised gas utility and an unregulated liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) distribution business. Founded in 1904, Hawaii Gas serves the States approximately 1.4 million residents and 10.0 million visitors across Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, Molokai and Lanai (the main islands).

Hawaii Gas utility business includes the processing, distribution and sale of synthetic natural gas (SNG) and renewable natural gas (RNG) and the distribution and sale of re-gasified liquefied natural gas (LNG) on the island of Oahu, as well as the distribution and sale of LPG via pipeline on all of the main islands. Hawaii Gas unregulated business distributes LPG by truck to individual tanks located on customer sites or distributes LPG in cylinders filled at central locations to customers on all the main islands. Customers include a wide variety of residential, commercial, hospitality, military, public sector and wholesale users. 
 Hawaii Gas primary products consist of: 
 Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG):  The business converts a light hydrocarbon feedstock (naphtha) into SNG which has a similar heating value to natural gas. Hawaii Gas operates the only SNG processing capability in Hawaii at its plant located on the island of Oahu. SNG is delivered by underground pipelines to utility customers throughout Oahu. 
 Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG):  LPG is a generic name for a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, typically propane and butane. LPG liquefies at a relatively low pressure under normal temperature conditions and can be efficiently transported in a range of quantities. LPG is typically stored in cylinders or tanks and Hawaii Gas maintains the largest network of LPG storage throughout Hawaii. Domestic and commercial applications of LPG are similar to those of natural gas and SNG. 
 Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG):  LNG is transported to Hawaii in conventional intermodal cryogenic containers from the U.S. mainland. Hawaii Gas utilizes LNG to offset up to 30% of the naphtha used to produce SNG that supplies customers of the regulated utility on Oahu. 
 Renewable Natural Gas (RNG):  In December 2018, Hawaii Gas commissioned a renewable natural gas facility capable of collecting and purifying biogas from the Honouliuli Wastewater Treatment Plant and injecting it into the utility pipeline distribution system on Oahu. The business continues to evaluate a range of additional renewable feedstock sources including other waste water treatment plants, landfills and locally produced biomass.

 MIC Hawaii  (continued) 
 Customers 
 The businesses of MIC Hawaii provide services to commercial, residential and governmental customers. MIC Hawaii does not depend on any single customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business. 
Utility Regulation 
 Hawaii Gas utility business is regulated by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (HPUC). The HPUC exercises broad regulatory oversight and investigative authority over all public utilities in Hawaii. 
 Rate Regulation.  The HPUC establishes the rates that Hawaii Gas can charge its utility customers via cost of service regulation. Although the HPUC sets the base rate for the gas sold by Hawaii Gas utility business, Hawaii Gas is permitted to pass through changes in its fuel costs by means of a monthly fuel adjustment charge. 
 Hawaii Gas utility rates are established by the HPUC in periodic rate cases typically initiated by Hawaii Gas. The business initiates a rate case by submitting a request to the HPUC for an increase in rates based upon, for example, increased costs related to providing services. Following initiation of the rate increase request and submissions by other intervening parties of their positions on the rate request, and potentially an evidentiary hearing, the HPUC issues a decision establishing the revenue requirements and the resulting rates that Hawaii Gas will be allowed to charge. 
 On December 21, 2018, the HPUC issued its Final Decision and Order in the rate case filed by Hawaii Gas in August 2017, authorizing an increase in regulated revenue of $8.9 million or 8.4%. This is consistent with the HPUCs Interim Decision and Order issued in June 2018 that approved new rates effective July 1, 2018. 
 Other Regulations.  In addition to regulating utility rates, the HPUC acts on requests for the acquisition, sale, disposition or other exchange of utility properties, including mergers and consolidations; acts on requests for financings; and approves material supply contracts. 
Competition 
 Depending upon the end-use, Hawaii Gas competes with electric generators as well as other gas providers. Electricity in Hawaii is generated by four electric utilities and various independent power producers. In addition, residential and some commercial customers in Hawaii have increased the rate at which they are installing solar photovoltaic generating capacity. 
 Hawaii Gas Utility Business.  Hawaii Gas holds the only government franchise for utility gas services in Hawaii. This enables Hawaii Gas to utilize public easements for its pipeline distribution systems. This franchise also provides for the exclusive use of extensive below-ground distribution infrastructure that Hawaii Gas owns and maintains. Hawaii Gas competes on the basis of price, reliability and the energy preferences of its customers. 
 Hawaii Gas Non-Utility Business.  Hawaii Gas sells LPG in an unregulated market on the main islands of Hawaii. There are several other wholesale and smaller retail distributors that compete in the LPG market. Hawaii Gas believes it has a competitive advantage because of its established customer base, storage facilities, distribution network and reputation for reliable service. 
Fuel Supply, SNG Plant and Distribution System 
 Fuel Supply 
 Hawaii Gas sources naphtha feedstock for its SNG plant from Par Hawaii Refining, LLC (Par) pursuant to a contract that expires in December 2020. The majority of Hawaii Gas LPG is purchased from an off-island supplier. Hawaii Gas sources LNG from a U.S. mainland supplier pursuant to a contract that expires in July 2021. RNG is purchased from the City and County of Honolulu under a fixed rate contract that expires in December 2024.

 MIC Hawaii  (continued) 
 SNG Plant and Distribution System (Utility Business) 
 Hawaii Gas processes and distributes SNG from a plant located on the west side of Oahu. A 22-mile transmission pipeline links the SNG plant to a distribution system at Pier 38 in south Oahu. From Pier 38, a pipeline distribution system consisting of approximately 900 miles of distribution and service pipelines transports gas to customers. On islands other than Oahu, LPG is distributed by direct deliveries from an off-island shipper and by barge from Oahu to holding facilities or base-yards on those islands. It is then distributed via pipelines to utility customers. Approximately 90% of the Hawaii Gas pipeline system is on Oahu. 
Distribution System (Non-Utility Business) 
 The non-utility business of Hawaii Gas provides LPG to customers on each of the main islands that are not connected to Hawaii Gas utility pipeline system. The majority of Hawaii Gas non-utility customers are on islands other than Oahu. LPG is transported to these islands by direct deliveries from an off-island shipper and by barge from Oahu. Hawaii Gas also owns the infrastructure by which it distributes LPG to its customers, including harbor pipelines, trucks, several holding facilities and storage base-yards on Kauai, Maui and Hawaii. 
Environmental Permits 
 The businesses of MIC Hawaii require environmental operating permits, the most significant of which are air and wastewater permits required for the Hawaii Gas SNG plant. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, MIC Hawaii had 330 employees, of which 215 are subject to the terms of collective bargaining agreements. We believe relationships with both union and non-union employees are generally good. 
Corporate and Other 
 Corporate and Other comprises MIC Corporate, our shared services center and other smaller businesses. 
 The financial results for MIC Corporate also reflect the costs associated with operating as a public company. These include primarily the fees paid in connection with the evaluation of various investment and acquisition/disposition opportunities, fees paid to the New York Stock Exchange, fees paid to our external auditors and advisors and the cost of Directors and Officers insurance. Other corporate center costs including the salaries, benefits and incentives paid to individuals seconded to MIC, together with the cost of our facilities, technology and services provided to the holding company by the Manager, are covered in the Fees to Manager  related party line item. 
 In 2017, we formed and staffed MGS, a shared services center that provides common administrative functions including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration, information technology, procurement, tax, legal and certain finance and accounting functions to the businesses in our portfolio. Substantially all of the costs associated with the operation of MGS are allocated to each of our operating companies. Any unallocated MGS costs are reported as a component of our Corporate and Other segment.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Corporate and Other  (continued) 
 Other businesses within Corporate and Other include those that do not meet the criteria for being a reportable segment on a standalone basis. These include a business relationship with a third party renewables developer, the Companys joint venture with a developer of solar power facilities and other smaller businesses. Prior to October 2018, these businesses were reported as part of the Contracted Power segment. Following the sale of BEC and the commencement of a sale process involving substantially all of our portfolio of solar and wind power generation businesses, the Contracted Power segment has been eliminated. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, Corporate and Other had 142 employees at MGS. MIC Corporate has no employees as our Manager seconds those individuals who serve as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer on a full-time basis and makes other personnel available as required. 
Consolidated 
 Our Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, our consolidated businesses employed approximately 3,300 people, of which approximately 20% were subject to collective bargaining agreements.
