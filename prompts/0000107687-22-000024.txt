Principal Products
Our operations are organized into three reportable segments, Towable, Motorhome, and Marine, based on similarities within their markets, products, operations and distributions.
Towable
A towable is a non-motorized vehicle that is designed to be towed by automobiles, pickup trucks, SUVs, or vans and is used as temporary living quarters for recreational travel. The Recreation Vehicle Industry Association ("RVIA") classifies towables into four types: conventional travel trailers, fifth wheels, folding camper trailers, and truck campers. We manufacture and sell conventional travel trailers and fifth wheels under the Winnebago and Grand Design brand names, which are defined as follows:

Type | Description | Winnebago product offerings | Grand Design product offerings 
Travel trailer | Towed by means of a hitch attached to the frame of the vehicle | HIKE, Micro Minnie, Minnie, and Voyage | Transcend, Imagine, Momentum, and Reflection
Fifth wheel | Constructed with a raised forward section that is connected to the vehicle with a special fifth wheel hitch | N/A | Reflection, Momentum, and Solitude 

Our travel trailer and fifth wheel towables are sold by dealers in the retail market with manufacturer's suggested retail prices ranging from approximately $33,000 to $154,000, depending on size and model, plus optional equipment and delivery charges.

Motorhome
A motorhome is a self-propelled mobile dwelling used primarily as temporary living quarters during vacation and camping trips, or to support active and mobile lifestyles. The RVIA classifies motorhomes into four types, all of which we manufacture and sell under the Winnebago and Newmar brand names, which are defined as follows:

Type | Description | Winnebago product offerings | Newmar product offerings 
Class A | Built on a heavy truck chassis in both diesel and gas models with the ability to tow a small vehicle | Gas: Adventurer, Sunstar, and Vista | Gas: Bay Star and Bay Star Sport 
Diesel: Forza and Journey | Diesel: Canyon Star, Dutch Star, Essex, King Aire, Kountry Star, London Aire, Mountain Aire, New Aire, and Ventana 
Class B | Built by adding a taller roof and amenities to an existing van, which allows for easy maneuvering | Gas: Travato and Solis | N/A 
Diesel: Era, Boldt, and Revel
Class C | Built on a medium truck chassis in both diesel and gas models with similar features and amenities to Class A models | Gas: Ekko, Spirit, and Minnie Winnie | Diesel: Super Star and Supreme Aire
Diesel: View and Navion 
Accessibility Enhanced | Vehicle with a wheelchair lift to allow individuals with physical disabilities access to the motorhome | Gas: Roam AE | N/A 
Diesel: Inspire AE 

Our Class A, B, C and accessibility enhanced motorhomes are sold by dealers in the retail market with manufacturer's suggested retail prices ranging from approximately $115,000 to $1,600,000, depending on size and model, plus optional equipment and delivery charges. Our motorhomes range in length from 18 to 45 feet.
Motorhome parts and service activities represent revenues generated by service work we perform for retail customers at our Forest City, Iowa and Nappanee, Indiana facilities as well as revenues from the sale of unit parts. Our competitive strategy is to provide proprietary manufactured parts through our dealer network, which we believe increases customer satisfaction and the value of our motorhomes.
Marine
We manufacture and sell premium quality boats under our Chris-Craft and Barletta brands in the recreational powerboat industry through an established network of independent authorized dealers. We acquired Barletta on August 31, 2021. Refer to Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail regarding the acquisition.

Type | Chris-Craft product offerings | Barletta product offerings
Boats | Launch, Launch GT, Calypso, Catalina | Lusso, Corsa, Cabrio 

Our boats are sold by dealers in the retail market with manufacturer's suggested retail prices ranging from approximately $63,000 to $782,000, depending on size and model, plus optional equipment and delivery charges.
Winnebago Specialty Vehicles
We also manufacture other specialty commercial vehicles custom designed for the buyer's specific needs and requirements, such as law enforcement command centers, mobile medical clinics, and mobile office space. These specialty commercial vehicles are manufactured in Forest City, Iowa and sold through our dealer network. In addition, we also provide commercial vehicles as bare shells to third-party upfitters for conversion at their facilities. 
Production
We generally produce towable, motorhome, and marine products made to order for dealers. We have some ability to increase our capacity by scheduling overtime and/or hiring additional production employees or to decrease our capacity through the use of shortened work weeks and/or reducing head count. We have long been known as an industry leader in innovation as each year we introduce new or redesigned products. These changes generally include new floor plans, features, functionality, and sizes as well as design and decor modifications. Most of our raw materials such as steel, aluminum, fiberglass, and wood products are obtainable from numerous sources.
Our towables are produced at two assembly campuses located in Middlebury, Indiana. The majority of components are comprised of frames, appliances, and furniture, and are purchased from multiple suppliers.
Our motorhomes are produced in the states of Iowa and Indiana at five different campuses. Our motorhome business utilizes vertically integrated supply streams, with the principal exceptions being chassis, engines, generators, and appliances that we purchase from multiple suppliers. Certain parts, especially motorhome chassis, are available from a small group of suppliers.
Our marine products are produced in the states of Indiana and Florida at two different campuses. We manufacture certain components and purchase other components from suppliers and install them on the boat. Certain parts, especially motors, are available from a small group of suppliers. 
Backlog
We strive to balance timely order fulfillment to our dealers with the lead times suppliers require to efficiently source materials and manage costs. Production facility constraints at peak periods also lead to fluctuations in backlog orders which we manage closely. A more detailed description of our Towable, Motorhome, and Marine order backlog is included in Item 7 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Distribution and Financing
We distribute our RV and marine products primarily through independent dealers throughout the U.S. and Canada, who then retail the products to the end consumer. We also distribute our marine products internationally through independent dealers, who then retail the products to the end consumer. Foreign sales accounted for less than 10% of net revenues during each of the past three fiscal years.

As of August 27, 2022, our RV and marine dealer network in the U.S. and Canada included approximately 750 physical dealer locations, many of which carry more than one of our brands. None of our dealer organizations accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues during each of the past three fiscal years.
We have sales and service agreements with most dealers which are subject to annual review. Many of the dealers are also engaged in other areas of business, including the sale of automobiles, trailers, or boats, and most dealers carry one or more competitive lines of products. We continue to place high emphasis on the capability of our dealers to provide complete service for our products. Dealers are obligated to provide full service for owners of our products or, in lieu thereof, to secure such service from other authorized providers.
We advertise and promote our products through national trade magazines, product brochures, the Go RVing national advertising campaign sponsored by RVIA, our websites, social media, direct-mail advertising campaigns, various national promotional opportunities, and on a local basis through trade shows, television, radio, and newspapers, primarily in connection with area dealers.
Sales to dealers are made primarily on cash terms. Most dealers are financed on a "floorplan" basis under which a bank or finance company lends the dealer all, or substantially all, of the purchase price, collateralized by a security interest in the merchandise purchased. As is customary in the industries we serve, we typically enter into a repurchase agreement with a lending institution financing a dealer's purchase of our product upon the lending institution's request and after completion of a credit check of the dealer involved. Our repurchase agreements provide that, for up to 18 months after an RV unit is financed and up to 24 months after a marine unit is financed, in the event of default by the dealer on the agreement to pay the lending institution and repossession of the unit(s) by the lending institution, we will repurchase the financed merchandise from the lender at the amount then due, which is often less than dealer invoice. Our maximum exposure for repurchases can vary significantly, depending upon the level of dealer inventory, general economic conditions, demand for our products, dealer location, and access to and the cost of financing. See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition
The RV and marine markets are highly competitive with many other manufacturers selling products which compete directly with our products. Some of our competitors are much larger than us, most notably in the towable RV market, which may provide these competitors additional purchasing power. The competition in our industries is based upon design, price, quality, features, and service of the products. We believe our principal competitive advantages are our brand strength, product differentiation, product quality, and our service after the sale. We also believe that our products have historically commanded a price premium as a result of these competitive advantages. 
Seasonality
The primary use of RVs and marine products for leisure travel and outdoor recreation has historically led to a peak retail selling season concentrated in the spring and summer months and lower sales during fall and winter months. Our sales are generally influenced by this pattern in retail sales, but sales can also be impacted by the level of dealer inventory. As a result, our sales are historically lowest during our second fiscal quarter, which ends in February.
Governmental Regulations
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and, to a limited extent, international laws and regulations, including the federal Motor Vehicle Act ("MVA"), under which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") may require manufacturers to recall RVs that contain safety-related defects, and numerous state consumer protection laws and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles, including so-called "Lemon Laws." The Boat Safety Act of 1971 has similar safety-related recall requirements for marine units. In addition, marine units sold in the U.S. and Europe must meet the certification standards of the U.S. Coast Guard and the European Community, respectively. 
We are also subject to regulations established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"). Our facilities are periodically inspected by federal and state agencies, such as OSHA. We are a member of RVIA, a voluntary association of RV manufacturers which promulgates RV safety standards. We place an RVIA seal on each of our RVs to certify that the RVIA standards have been met. We believe that our products and facilities comply in all material respects with the applicable vehicle safety, consumer protection, RVIA, and OSHA regulations and standards.
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental laws and regulations relating to the use, generation, storage, treatment, emission, labeling, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and noise pollution. We believe that we are currently in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations in all material aspects.
Trademarks 
Our products are marketed under a variety of valuable trademarks. Some of the more important trademarks used in our business include Winnebago, Grand Design, Newmar, Chris-Craft, and Barletta. We protect these trademarks as appropriate through registrations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Depending on jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use. 
We continue our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products, many of which use proprietary expertise, trade secrets, and know-how. We consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. 
Human Capital Management
Our employees are our greatest strength and we are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, high-performance culture where our people thrive. We strive to recruit, develop, engage and protect our workforce. The following are key human capital measures and objectives that we currently focus on:
Employee Experience – Leadership and Culture Development
We believe our future success depends on our people. Attracting, engaging, retaining and developing diverse talent is a key priority. We strive to grow and develop all of our teams and bolster our talent pipeline. Our leadership expectations provide a shared understanding of the skills our teams develop through continuous learning opportunities and training. Our Code of Conduct and our human rights policy include shared values and guide relationships with our people and our stakeholders. To build and attract the next generation of leaders, we have developed external partnerships, introducing high school and first-generation college students to potential career opportunities in the RV and marine industries. To increase the pipeline of diverse talent in the outdoor industry, we provided founding support to the Leaders from The Future of Work Internship Program in partnership with nonprofit partner Camber Outdoors. This innovative, diversity, equity, and inclusive ("DEI") focused internship program engages Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and Native/Indigenous students in meaningful paid summer internships. We 

also collaborate with regional education and workforce development partners to connect job seekers with on-the-job training and leadership development.
Team members respond regularly to an engagement survey, administered at least every two years, that evaluates our employees’ thoughts about their experience working at Winnebago Industries. Responses are reviewed by team leaders and used to help build specific action plans to continually improve our employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We engage employees through community volunteerism, team-building, and employee resource groups. We strive to continually improve our employee experience, develop and grow our teams, and create a culture of inclusion and belonging.
As of August 27, 2022, we employed approximately 7,445 persons, of which 28% and 72% were non-production and production workers, respectively. In addition, 14% and 86% were salaried and hourly employees, respectively. None of our employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
Commitment to Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Action ("IDEA")
We embrace the ideals of IDEA in our company. We believe in the value of building a company and community where every person feels welcome, is treated fairly, and has an equal opportunity to succeed while bringing their authentic self to work. “All In, Outdoors” is a deliberate approach to how we act and treat each other at Winnebago Industries, and a roadmap for creating a better sense of belonging in our workplace, our communities and the outdoors. We advance our strategy by listening and learning, including by establishing an IDEA Speaker series, where subject matter experts provide inspiration, tools, and resources to create an inclusive culture. We also instituted our Courageous Conversations program, which builds connections with employees through conversations that provide awareness and understanding around community and cultural sensitivities that can be difficult in the workplace. We launched our first employee resource group, the Women’s Inclusion Network ("WIN"), whose mission is to support the professional development of women by encouraging access to learning, mentoring, and networking. WIN’s goal is to increase women’s sense of belonging and the percentage of women in leadership roles within our businesses. We remain involved with CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, including supporting its inaugural mentoring program with mentors from our executive leadership team and mentees from WIN. 
We are committed to increasing inclusion across our industry and beyond. At the leadership level, 24% of our officers and directors are women, and 9% are racially or ethnically diverse as of August 27, 2022. We continue to expand our partnerships with nonprofit organizations led by and for communities of color and women and organizations helping to diversify the talent pipeline including Camber Outdoors and the Society of Women Engineers. 
We recognize the importance of having diverse perspectives on our Board of Directors and aspire to promote diversity as we build and refresh our Board of Directors. Our IDEA framework, which serves as a roadmap to guide us forward on our inclusion journey, includes the Board of Directors, leadership development, and engagement. During Women’s History month, we hosted a Women in the Workplace panel, which was composed of our two female directors and our female general counsel, for all employees. As of August 27, 2022, 20% of our Board of Directors were women, and 20% were racially or ethnically diverse.
We believe our company and our brands should reflect the diversity of outdoor enthusiasts. We also believe we thrive and are more successful when we empower, value, and respect our employees and our communities. We are committed to continuing to build a stronger, more inclusive culture and workplace.
Employee Well-being and Safety
We are committed to designing, operating, and maintaining safe and controlled working conditions, including a "zero-harm" culture for all employees. We have implemented actions to build an increasingly risk-informed perspective within our culture to reduce the occurrences of injuries and illness. All sites have established a baseline risk control score with the goal to achieve at least 95% sustainable level control by the end of 2024. Between Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022, we improved our control levels by 20%, and are on track to meet our goal of 95% or greater across all businesses. We remained stable on our total recordable incidence rate ("TRIR") in Fiscal 2022 as compared to Fiscal 2021. Our experience and continuing focus on workplace safety enabled us to preserve business continuity and maintain our commitment to keeping our employees and visitors safe, during the continuing stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the mental, emotional, and physical well-being of our employees as a key focus, we have provided resources for employees to manage remote work and balance parental and other family responsibilities.
