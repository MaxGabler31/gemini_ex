Item 1.    BUSINESS
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
W. R. Grace & Co. is engaged in the production and sale of specialty chemicals and specialty materials on a global basis through two reportable business segments: Grace Catalysts Technologies, which includes catalysts and related products and technologies used in refining, petrochemical and other chemical manufacturing applications; and Grace Materials Technologies, which includes specialty materials, including silica-based and silica-alumina-based materials, used in consumer/pharma, chemical process, and coatings applications.
Grace is the successor to a company that began in 1854 and originally became a public company in 1953. We entered the specialty chemicals and specialty materials industries in 1954, the year in which we acquired the Davison Chemical Company. W. R. Grace & Co. is a Delaware corporation.
Developments
On April 3, 2018, using cash on hand and borrowings under our credit agreement, we acquired the assets of the polyolefin catalysts business of Albemarle Corporation. We acquired the business for $418.0 million, net of cash acquired and including customary post-closing adjustments. The business is included in the Specialty Catalysts operating segment of the Grace Catalysts Technologies reportable segment. The acquisition is complementary to our existing specialty catalysts business and strengthens our commercial relationships, catalysts technology portfolio, and manufacturing network.
On January 27, 2016, Grace entered into a separation agreement with GCP Applied Technologies Inc., then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grace (“GCP”), pursuant to which Grace agreed to transfer its Grace Construction Products operating segment and the packaging technologies business of its Grace Materials Technologies operating segment to GCP (the “Separation”). Grace and GCP completed the Separation on February 3, 2016 (the “Distribution Date”), by means of a pro rata distribution to the Company’s stockholders of all of the outstanding shares of GCP common stock (the “Distribution”), with one share of GCP common stock distributed for each share of Company common stock held as of the close of business on January 27, 2016. As a result of the Distribution, GCP became an independent public company. GCP’s historical financial results through the Distribution Date are reflected in Grace’s Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations.
On February 3, 2014, Grace concluded a voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, when the joint plan of reorganization (the “Joint Plan”) filed by Grace and certain other parties became effective.
Global Scope
We operate our business on a global scale with approximately 72% of our 2018 sales outside the United States. We operate and/or sell to customers in over 70 countries and in over 30 currencies. We manage our operating segments on a global basis, to serve global markets. Currency fluctuations affect our reported results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.
Profitable Growth Strategy
We create value for customers and investors by profitably growing our specialty chemicals and specialty materials businesses and achieving high levels of efficiency and cash flow. To meet these objectives, we:

Grace Catalysts Technologies—Refining Catalysts
FCC Catalysts 
We are a global leader in developing and manufacturing fluid catalytic cracking, or FCC, catalysts and additives that are designed to enable petroleum refiners to increase profits by improving product yields, value and quality. Our FCC products also enable refiners to reduce emissions from their FCC units and reduce sulfur content in the transportation fuels they produce. Oil refining is a highly specialized discipline and FCC catalysts must be tailored to meet local variations in crude oil feedstocks and a refinery’s product mix. We work regularly with our customers to identify the most appropriate catalyst and additive formulations for their changing needs.
Many countries and regions, including the U.S., European Union, Japan, Russia, India and China have imposed regulatory limitations on the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuel. We have developed a portfolio of products designed to assist refiners in meeting their gasoline sulfur-reduction targets, including our D-PRISM® and GSR® additives and our SURCA® catalyst family.
Also, many U.S. petroleum refiners have entered into consent decrees with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) under which the refiners have agreed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The European Union has also imposed requirements on refineries with respect to nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides emissions. Our additives are designed to assist refineries in meeting their obligations to reduce these pollutants. Our Super DESOX® additive reduces sulfur oxides emissions from commercial FCC units. Our DENOX® additives are designed to achieve reductions in nitrogen oxides emissions comparable to those obtained from capital intensive alternatives available to a refinery, while our non-platinum-based combustion promoters XNOX® and CP® P are designed to enable refiners to control carbon monoxide emissions without increasing nitrogen oxides.
Hydroprocessing Catalysts
We market most of our hydroprocessing catalysts through our Advanced Refining Technologies LLC (“ART”) joint venture with Chevron Products Company (“Chevron”). We hold a 50% economic interest in ART, which is not consolidated in our financial statements so ART’s sales are excluded from our sales. We established ART to combine our technology with that of Chevron and to develop, market and sell hydroprocessing catalysts to customers in the petroleum refining industry worldwide.
We are a leading supplier of hydroprocessing catalysts designed for processing high resid content feedstocks. We offer products for fixed-bed resid hydrotreating, on-stream catalyst replacement, and ebullating-bed resid hydrocracking processes.
We also offer a full line of catalysts, customized for individual refiners, used in distillate hydrotreating to produce ultra-low sulfur content gasoline and diesel fuel, including our SmART CATALYST SYSTEM® and APART® catalyst systems. As discussed above, regulatory limitations on the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuel are becoming more common. These products are designed to help refiners to reduce the sulfur content of their products.
We have rights to sell hydrocracking and lubes hydroprocessing catalysts to licensees of Chevron Lummus Global (“CLG”) and other petroleum refiners for unit refills. These rights allow us to streamline hydroprocessing catalyst supply and improve technical service for refining customers by establishing ART as their single point of contact for all their hydroprocessing catalyst needs.
Polyolefin Catalysts, Catalyst Supports and Polypropylene Process Technology
We are a leading provider of catalyst systems and catalyst supports to the polyolefins industry for a variety of polyethylene and polypropylene process technologies.
We use a combination of proprietary catalyst and support technology and technology licensed from third parties to provide unique catalyst-based solutions to our customers and to provide a broad technology portfolio for enhancing collaboration opportunities with technology leaders.
Also, we are a leading licensor of gas-phase polypropylene process technology to polypropylene manufacturers. Our UNIPOL® polypropylene technology is designed to have fewer moving parts and require less equipment than other competing technologies, which reduces operating costs. This technology provides our 
4

licensees with a flexible and reliable capability to manufacture products for a broad array of end-use applications. The polypropylene process licensing industry is technology-intensive, and licensors must adapt the technology and the related licenses to meet individual customer needs.
Manufacturing, Marketing and Raw Materials
Our Catalysts Technologies products are manufactured by a network of globally coordinated plants. Our integrated planning organization is responsible for the effective utilization of our manufacturing capabilities. For a discussion of our principal manufacturing plants for Catalysts Technologies, see Item 2, “Properties,” below.
We use a global organization of technical professionals with extensive experience in refining processes, catalyst development, and catalyst applications to market our refining catalysts and additives. These professionals work to tailor our technology to the needs of each specific customer. We generally negotiate prices for our refining catalysts because our formulations are specific to the needs of each customer and each customer receives individual attention and technical service. We sell a significant portion of our hydroprocessing catalysts through multiple-year supply agreements with our geographically diverse customer base.
We use a global direct sales force for our polyolefin catalysts, supports and technologies and chemical catalysts that seeks to maintain close working relationships with our customers. These relationships enable us to cooperate with major polymer and chemical producers to develop catalyst technologies that complement their process or application developments. We have geographically distributed our sales and technical service professionals to make them responsive to the needs of our geographically diverse customers. We typically operate under long-term contracts with our customers.
The principal raw materials for Catalysts Technologies products include molybdenum oxide, zeolite, caustic soda, alumina and derivatives, sodium silicate, nickel, rare earths, and tungsten salt. Multiple suppliers are generally available for each of these materials; however, some of our raw materials may be provided by single sources of supply. We seek to mitigate the risk of using single source suppliers by identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers or, for unique materials, by using alternative formulations from other suppliers or by passing price increases on to customers. In some instances, we produce our own raw materials and intermediates.
Prices for many of our raw materials, including metals, and energy can be volatile. In response to increases in raw material and energy costs, we generally take actions to mitigate the effects of higher costs including increasing prices, developing alternative formulations for our products, increasing productivity, and hedging purchases of certain raw materials.
As in many chemical businesses, we consume significant quantities of natural gas in the production of Catalysts Technologies products. World events and other economic factors cause volatility in the price of natural gas. Increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas and raw materials can have a significant impact on our operating margins. We have implemented a risk management program under which we hedge natural gas in a way that is designed to provide protection against price volatility.
Seasonality
Seasonality does not have a significant overall effect on our Catalysts Technologies reportable segment. However, under traditional patterns, sales of FCC catalysts have tended to be lower in the first calendar quarter due to maintenance outages taken prior to the shift in production by refineries from home heating oil for the winter season to gasoline production for the summer season. FCC catalysts and ebullating-bed hydroprocessing catalysts are consumed at a relatively steady rate and are replaced regularly. Fixed-bed hydroprocessing catalysts are consumed over a period of years and are replaced in bulk in an irregular pattern. Since our customers periodically shut down their refining processes to replace fixed-bed hydroprocessing catalysts in bulk, our hydroprocessing catalyst sales to any customer can vary substantially over the course of a year and between years based on that customer’s catalyst replacement schedule.
Backlog of Orders; Working Capital
While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, this backlog is not material in respect to our total annual sales for Catalysts Technologies, nor are the changes, from time to time, significant. There have not been any significant out-of-the-ordinary practices related to working capital items for Catalysts Technologies.

Our global footprint allows us to partner effectively with both multinational and regional companies requiring multiple manufacturing facilities complemented by regional technical expertise in local languages. For a discussion of our principal manufacturing plants for Materials Technologies, see Item 2, “Properties,” below.
We use country-based direct sales forces and further support our customers with application-specific technical customer service teams to market our Materials Technologies products. Our sales force seeks to develop long-term relationships with our customers and focuses on consultative sales, technical support and key account growth programs. To ensure full geographic coverage, our direct sales organization is further supplemented by a network of distributors.
The principal raw materials for Materials Technologies products include sodium silicate, zeolite, sand, soda ash, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda. Multiple suppliers are generally available for each of these materials; however, some of our raw materials may be provided by single sources of supply. We seek to mitigate the risk of using single source suppliers by identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers or, for unique materials, by using alternative formulations from other suppliers. In some instances, we produce our own raw materials and intermediates.
Prices for some of our raw materials and energy can be volatile. In response to increases in input costs, we generally take actions intended to mitigate the effects of higher costs including increasing prices, developing alternative formulations for our products, and increasing productivity.
As in many chemical businesses, we consume significant quantities of natural gas in the production of Materials Technologies products. World events and other economic factors can cause volatility in the price of natural gas. Increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas and raw materials can have a significant impact on our operating margins. We have implemented a risk management program under which we hedge natural gas in a way that is intended to provide protection against price volatility.
Seasonality
Seasonality does not have a significant overall effect on our Materials Technologies reportable segment; however, sales of our adsorbents for dual frame windows are affected by seasonal and weather-related factors and the level of construction activity, and sales of our stabilizers and clarification aids for beer, juices and other beverages are affected by the level of consumption of beverages. These impacts are mitigated by the global scope of our business.
Backlog of Orders; Working Capital
While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, this backlog is not material in respect to our total annual sales for Materials Technologies, nor are the changes, from time to time, significant. There have not been any significant out-of-the-ordinary practices relating to working capital items for Materials Technologies.
Competition
There are many manufacturers of engineered materials that market their products on a global basis including Evonik, PQ, and UOP. Competition is generally based on product performance, technical service, quality and reliability, price, and other differentiated product features to address the needs of customers, end-users and brand owners. Our products compete on the basis of distinct technology, product quality, and customer support. Competition for these products is highly fragmented, with a large number of companies that sell their products on a global or regional basis.
8

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; RESEARCH ACTIVITIES
Competition in the specialty chemicals and specialty materials industry is often based on technological superiority and innovation. Our ability to maintain our margins and effectively compete with other suppliers depends on our ability to introduce new products based on innovative technology, as well as our ability to obtain patent or other intellectual property protection. Our research and development programs emphasize development of new products and processes, improvement of existing products and processes, and application of existing products and processes to new industries and uses. We conduct most of our research activity in North America and Europe.
We selectively file and obtain patents in our Refining Technologies business, as well as in our chemical catalysts product line in our Specialty Catalysts business, for strategic new products or for significant business opportunities. We routinely file and obtain patents in a number of countries around the world that are significant to our polyolefin catalysts product line in our Specialty Catalysts business. In our Materials Technologies business, we focus our research on the development and use of materials-based specialty products, and expertise for diverse applications. We file patents and use trade secret protection to protect our unique products, processes and expertise in strategic segments of the business, and to cover key product innovations in adjacent market segments. We file and obtain patents and trademarks in various countries to strengthen and protect our product offerings globally.
We file patents in order to protect our investments in innovation, research, and product development. Numerous patents and patent applications protect our products, formulations, manufacturing processes, equipment, and improvements. We also benefit from the use of trade secret information, including know-how and other proprietary information relating to many of our products and processing technologies. There can be no assurance, however, that our patents, patent applications and precautions to protect trade secrets and know-how will provide sufficient protection for our intellectual property. In addition, other companies may independently develop technology that could replicate, and thus diminish the advantage provided by, our trade secrets. Other companies may also develop alternative technology or design-arounds that could circumvent our patents or may acquire patent rights applicable to our business which might interpose a limitation on expansion of our business in the future.
ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
We are subject, along with other manufacturers of specialty chemicals, to stringent regulations under numerous regional, national, provincial, state and local environment, health and safety laws and regulations relating to the manufacture, storage, handling, disposal and stewardship of chemicals and other materials. Environmental laws require that certain responsible parties, as defined in the relevant statute, fund remediation actions regardless of legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. We are involved in various response actions to address the presence of chemical substances as required by applicable laws. 
We have expended substantial funds to comply with environmental laws and regulations and expect to continue to do so in the future. The following table sets forth our expenditures in the past three years, and our estimated expenditures in 2019 and 2020, for (i) the operation and maintenance of manufacturing facilities and the disposal of wastes; (ii) capital expenditures for environmental control facilities; and (iii) site remediation:
