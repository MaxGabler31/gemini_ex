Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited is a Nevada holding corporation. We operate through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Energetic Mind Limited (“Energetic Mind”), a British Virgin Islands corporation, which in turn operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ricofeliz Capital (HK) Limited (“Ricofeliz Capital”), a Hong Kong corporation. Ricofeliz Capital which operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Co., Ltd (“Wuhan Newport”), a wholly foreign-owned enterprise incorporated in the People’s Republic of China that primarily engages in the business of real estate and infrastructural development and operating a port logistics center (“Logistics Center”) located in Wuhan, Hubei Province in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).
 
Situated in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Wuhan Newport is involved in a large infrastructure development project implemented under China’s latest “One Belt One Road” initiative. We believe that the project is strategically positioned in the anticipated “Pilot Free Trade Zone” of the Wuhan port, an important trading locale for the PRC, the Middle East and Europe. To be fully developed upon completion, the Logistics Center will comprise six operating zones: port operation area, warehouse and distribution area, cold chain logistics area, rail cargo loading area, exhibition area and business related area. The Logistics Center is also expected to provide a number of shipping berths for cargo ships of various sizes. Wuhan Newport expects to provide domestic and foreign businesses direct access to the anticipated Pilot Free Trade Zone in Wuhan. The project will include commercial buildings, professional logistic supply chain centers, direct access to the Yangtze River, Wuhan-Xinjiang-Europe Railway and ground transportation, storage and processing centers, and IT supporting services, among others.
 
We anticipate that income generated from the use of the warehouses, cargo loading and unloading, railway and highway transportation and logistics services and other logistics supporting services will comprise the main source of our income. It is also expected that income from the sales and leasing of commercial space will be a relatively minor portion of our expected income since we are planning to sell or lease only a small portion of our commercial properties . We will begin construction on the Logistics Center once we are able to raise funds for it.
 
In the meantime, we have been developing a commercial building project called the Wuhan Centre China Grand Steel Market (Phase 1) Commercial Building (“Phase 1 Project”) located in the south of Hans Road, Wuhan Yangluo Economic Development Zone which covers an approximate construction area of 222,496.6 square meters. We have been financing the Phase 1 Project with bank loans and shareholder advances. The Phase 1 Project comprises 7 buildings, of which 92,755.8 square meters have been completed. We have sold approximately 22,780 square meters of commercial building space.
 
We plan to use the majority of our real estate properties for the development of our Logistics Center, from which our main source of expected income will be derived.
 
Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Center
 
The Logistics Center will be an extensive complex located in Wuhan Newport Yangluo Port. Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei Province in the People’s Republic of China is a major transportation hub city with access to numerous railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to major cities in China, as well as other international centers of commerce and business.
 
The Logistics Center will be on the upper stream of the Yangtze River, and close to the northern base of Wuhan Iron and Steel, China’s first mega-sized iron and steel production complex. The Logistics Center is expected to include a port terminal that will be located approximately 26.5km from the Wuhan Guan and 5.5km from the Yangluo Yangtze River Bridge. The operation area of the port is expected to consist of a riverbank of 1,039 meters with eight 5,000-to-10,000-ton berths, two of which are multi-purpose berths and the other six are general cargo berths. It is designed to be able to handle up to 5,000,000 tons of cargo annually, including up to 100,000 TEU for annual container throughput (including 20,000 TEU in freezer areas), 1,000,000 tons of iron and steel and 3,000,000 tons of general cargo.

Within the Logistics Center, functional areas will be divided into six operating zones: a port operation area, a warehouse and distribution area, a cold chain supply logistics area, a rail cargo loading area, an exhibition area and a business related area. The Logistics Center will also be complemented with container storage areas, multi-functional areas, general storage areas, a multi-functional warehouse and infrastructural development, including new roads, gas stations, parking areas, gas and water pipes, electricity lines and all other facilities and equipment to operate the Logistics Center.
 
The Yangluo development area is among the third group of China’s Pilot Free Trade Zone (“FTZ”) applicants to submit FTZ applications to the State Council.
 
Wuhan Newport has signed a twenty-year lease agreement effective April 27, 2015, the maximum number of years permitted by the applicable PRC laws, with rights to renew, at its sole discretion, for another twenty-years, to lease approximately 1,200,000 square meters of land for building logistics warehouses in support of the Logistics Center. The warehouses are expected to be comprised port terminal zones, warehouse logistics zones, cold chain supply zones and railroad loading and unloading zones. The warehouses, once constructed, will connect the port terminal along the Yangtze River and the railway leading to Europe, satisfying the requirement of China’s latest “One Belt, One Road” initiative. It will also be able to support large logistics companies in Wuhan and other nearby provinces which will rent the warehouses, terminals and offices within the Logistics Center.

Wuhan Economic Development Port Limited
 
On December 26, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the shareholders (the “Wuhan Port Shareholders”) of Wuhan Economic Development Port Limited (the “Wuhan Port”) to acquire all the equity interests of Wuhan Port (the “Wuhan Port Acquisition”). In exchange, the Wuhan Shareholders will acquire all the ordinary shares of Energetic Mind and in turn, Ricofeliz Capital, Wuhan Newport and the abovementioned plans for the Logistics Center.
 
The closing of the transaction is conditioned upon satisfactory due diligence, the completion of auditing of the financial statements of Wuhan Port, and the approval of relevant regulatory agencies. The closing deadline of Wuhan Port Acquisition was originally March 31, 2018 and was extended three times to April 30, 2018, May 31, 2018 and finally, July 31, 2018. This transaction was not closed on July 31, 2018 and the Company and Fujian Yuesheng Industrial Development Limited, the representative of the Wuhan Port Shareholders failed to reach an agreement to further extend the closing deadline for this transaction. Accordingly, the parties have terminated the Purchase Agreement and the transaction thereunder. As a result, we shall continue our plans to develop the Logistics Center.

The “One Belt, One Road” Initiative.
 
According to the Vision and Actions on Jointly Building Belt and Road issued by the National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China, with State Council authorization in March 2015, “One Belt, One Road” (the “Initiative”) is a infrastructural development concept initiated by the leaders of the Chinese government in 2013. It refers to the New Silk Road Economic Belt, which will link China with Europe through Central and Western Asia, and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which will connect China with Southeast Asian countries, Africa and Europe through the Pacific and Indian Ocean. Neither the belt, nor the road, follows a designated route, but serves as a conceptual roadmap for China’s plan to expand its presence commercially to the regions outside of the country and strengthen its economic relationships with the nations in these regions.
 
The “Belt” and the “Road” run through the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa, connecting the vibrant East Asian economic circle on one end and developed European economic circle on the other, and encompassing countries with huge potential for economic development. The Silk Road Economic Belt focuses on bringing together China, Central Asia, Russia and Europe (the Baltic), linking China with the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea through Central Asia and West Asia, and connecting China with Southeast Asia, South Asia and the countries along the Indian Ocean. The 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road is designed to go from China’s coast to Europe through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean in one route, and from China’s coast through the South China Sea to the South Pacific in the other.
 
On land, the Initiative is expected to focus on jointly building a new Eurasian Land Bridge and developing China-Mongolia-Russia, China-Central Asia-West Asia and China-Indochina Peninsula economic corridors by taking advantage of international transport routes, relying on core cities along the Belt and Road and using key economic industrial parks as cooperation platforms. At sea, the Initiative is expected to focus on jointly building smooth, secure and efficient transportation routes connecting major sea ports along the Belt and the Road. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor are closely related to the Belt and Road Initiative, and therefore require closer cooperation and greater progress.

Corporate History
 
On December 23, 2009, we were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name of “Ciglarette International, Inc.”.
 
On March 1, 2011, we completed a reverse acquisition transaction through a share exchange with Kirin China Holding, a British Virgin Islands company (“Kirin China”), whereby acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Kirin China in exchange for 18,547,297 shares of common stock, which represented approximately 98.4% of the total shares outstanding immediately following the closing of this share exchange (the “First Share Exchange”). Upon consummation of the First Share Exchange, we changed our name to “Kirin International Holding, Inc.” and traded under the symbol “KIRI” on OTC Markets. As a result of the First Share Exchange, Kirin China became a wholly-owned subsidiary. We ceased the smokeless cigarette business and became a holding company, through various controlled entities in the China, engaged in the development and operation of real estate in China. Through Kirin China, we engaged in private real estate development focusing on residential and commercial real estate development in “tier-three” cities in China. Tier-three cities are provincial capital cities with ordinary economic development and prefecture cities with relatively strong economic development. 
 
On December 19, 2015, we entered into certain share exchange agreements with Energetic Mind and all the shareholders of Energetic Mind whereby the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Energetic Mind (the “Second Share Exchange”). Pursuant to the terms of the agreements for the Second Share Exchange, in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Energetic Mind, we agreed to issue to (i) the shareholders of Energetic Mind an aggregate of one hundred fifty-one million (151,000,000) shares of Company’s common stock and (2) a certain related party an additional 8% convertible promissory note in the principal amount of one hundred fifty million dollars ($150,000,000), with a conversion price of $10.00 per share.

On December 31, 2015, we disposed all of our interests in i) Brookhollow Lake, LLC, ii) Newport Property Holding, LLC, iii) Kirin China, iv) Kirin Hopkins Real Estate Group LLC, v) Archway Development Group LLC, vi) Specturm International Enterprise, LLC and vii) wholly-owned subsidiary HHC-6055 Centre Drive LLC. The sale of Kirin China also effectively terminated Company’s contractual relationship with Hebei Zhongding Real Estate Development Co. Ltd and Xingtai Zhongding Jiye Real Estate Development Co., Ltd, both of which are companies formed under the laws of the People’s Republic of China and were deemed Company’s variable interest entities prior to this sale (“Subsidiaries Sale”). 
 
As a result of the Second Share Exchange and the Subsidiaries Sale, the Company currently operates its business solely through its wholly-owned subsidiary Energetic Mind, which is the sole shareholder of Ricofeliz, which engages its business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wuhan Newport.
 
On January 13, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of the State of the State of Nevada, to change our name from “Kirin International Holding, Inc.” to “Yangtze River Development Limited”. Effective January 22, 2016, Company changed its stock symbol from “KIRI” to “YERR”.
 
The Company, by and among Armada Enterprises GP (“Armada”) and Wight International Construction, LLC (“Wight”), entered into (i) a Contribution, Conveyance and Assumption Agreement (“Contribution Agreement”) dated October 3, 2016, first and second addendums, dated October 3, 2016 and November 30, 2016, respectively, and (ii) an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement dated November 16, 2016 (collectively with the Contribution Agreement, the “Agreement”), whereby the Company acquired 100 million preferred B membership units of Wight, which would ultimately convert into 100 million LP units in Armada Enterprises LP. In exchange, the Company issued a $500 million convertible promissory note (“Note”) and 50,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to Wight. As a result of the Agreement and the conversion of the Note on November 17, 2016, Wight owned 100,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock representing 36.73% of the Company’s voting power and the Company owned 100 million preferred B membership units in Wight representing a 62.5% non-voting equity interest in Wight. 
 
Under the terms of the Agreement, at the first closing, Wight was required to provide an aggregate total of $200 million, including $50 million in working capital and $150 million in construction funding (the “Funding”) to the Company, by January 18, 2017. Wight did not provide the Funding on January 18, 2017 and the Company provided to Wight a “Notice of Default and Request for Cure”. Wight proposed to provide $50 million in working capital funding on or before February 15, 2017 and secure $150 million in construction funding on or before March 15, 2017. Wight failed to provide the $50 million in working capital funding as proposed by February 15, 2017. Therefore, the Company, on February 24, 2017 decided to terminate the Agreement for non-performance by Wight. Pursuant to the Agreement, the termination thereof calls for the immediate return of the 100,000,000 shares of common stock issued by the Company to Wight.
 
On February 27, 2017, the Company issued a “Termination and Demand” letter to Wight which terminated the Agreement with Wight and Armada and demanded the return of the 100,000,000 shares of common stock. 
 
On March 1, 2017, the 100,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock were canceled and returned by Wight, and were subsequently returned to the Company’s treasury.
 
The Company reserves the right to pursue any further legal action with respect to Armada’s and Wight’s default under the Agreement.
 
On April 19, 2017, our common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol of “YERR”. On August 18, 2017, our common stock started trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the same symbol.

On February 8, 2018, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, to change our name from “Yangtze River Development Limited” to “Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited” (the “Name Change”). In connection with the Name Change, our trading symbol was changed from “YERR” to “YRIV”.
 
Organization & Subsidiaries

Upon completion of the Second Share Exchange and Subsidiaries Sale described above in “Corporate History”, we hold 100% of the ordinary shares of our wholly owned subsidiary, Energetic Mind. Energetic Mind in turn operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ricofeliz Capital and Ricofeliz Capital operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wuhan Newport. Wuhan Newport primarily engages in the business of real estate and infrastructural development and operating the Logistics Center.
 
On January 30, 2018, we incorporated Yangtze River Blockchain Logistics Limited (previously known as Avenal River Limited) in the British Virgin Islands. Yangtze River Blockchain Logistics Limited owns all of the shares of Ricofeliz Investment (China) Limited, a Hong Kong company, which in turn owns 100% of the equity interest of Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Trading Limited, a PRC company.
 

The following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure:
 


Office Complex Project
 
Taking into consideration the Comprehensive Bonded Zone and Free Trade Zone status of the Logistic Center, Wuhan Newport has obtained the land use rights to own approximately 500,000 square meters of commercial lands on which Wuhan Newport will build a mixed residential and office complex of approximately 700,000 square meters. As of the date of this Annual Report, mixed-use complex totaling 92,755.8 square meters have been completed and there are outstanding 525,911.2 square meters to be constructed in three phases within the next five (5) years.
 
To support the complex, a light railway from downtown Wuhan to the complex has been completed . The complex is now accessible by two stations along the light railway line, cutting the commute to downtown Wuhan to only 20 minutes. In addition, an expressway along the north shore of the Yangtze River in Wuhan is currently under construction; the completion of the highway is also expected to provide direct ground access between Wuhan city center and the Logistics Center and cut down the commute time to only 20 minutes.

Upon completion of the construction of the office buildings, Wuhan Newport plans to sell half of the complex while leasing out the remaining half for long-term income. It is our goal to recover the initial investment costs through sale of half of the complex and generate a stable return based on rent of the other half complex upon completion of the project.
 
Transportation and Logistics Services
 
Taking the regional advantage of the highways, railways and waterways in Yangluo area, we plan to develop a shipping hub with access to all types of cargo transportation and offer complementary services to businesses within this logistics center. We intend to create an efficient, reliable and comprehensive logistics service system by utilizing the third-party service providers with offices within the Logistics Center to provide professional logistics services.
 
The Yangtze River riverbank within our properties measures 1,039 meters, where we plan to complete eight cargo berths handling ships ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 tons.
 
A cargo transportation railway invested by the government has been built next to the Logistic Center. The railway is known as the Wuhan-Xinjiang-Europe (“WXE”) Railway in the Silk Road Economic Zone as it is in the “One Belt, One Road” initiative introduced by the Chinese government. The WXE Freight Train sets out from Wuhan to Xinjiang and finally ends in Mainland Europe. Wuhan Newport’s terminal is therefore an important component of the “Silk Road Economic Belt” under the “One Belt, One Road” framework.
 
The customs facility at the Yangluo Comprehensive Bonded Area allows cargo vessels ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 tons to set out from Shanghai downstream via the Yangtze River in order to transport “Made in China” commodities to the Pacific Ocean and further to any other ports across the Indian Ocean. In return, transporting commodities from other countries will be shipped directly back to Wuhan and then distributed throughout rest of the Mainland China. The Yangluo development area is amongst the third group of China’s Free-Trade Zone applicants to submit FTZ applications to the State Council through the Wuhan municipal government for approval.
 
Cold Chain Logistics Services
 
A cold chain is a temperature-controlled supply chain. An unbroken cold chain is an uninterrupted series of storage and distribution activities which maintain a given temperature range. It is used to help extend and ensure the shelf life of products such as fresh agricultural produce, seafood and frozen food.
 
Within the Logistics Center, we will be able to provide extensive storage and processing services to its customers. Meanwhile, a cold chain logistics service system will be established to better help our clients’ processing needs for their frozen foods, meats and other products that need special processing and handling. In addition, we will offer professional services with temperature control, sorting, processing, packaging and delivery to ensure the reliability and safety of the logistics process.
 
Information Platform
 
To adapt to the needs of modern logistics service and meet the standards of the industry worldwide, we will establish comprehensive automated management systems, as well as develop an operation system, enquiry system and decision-making systems for all types of business information such as warehouse, storage, trade, distribution and transportation, movable assets supervision and freight forwarding. We plan to launch an integrated and information-sharing platform geared towards the demand of its targeted markets and potential clients.
 
6

 

We will establish a uniform information platform including an internet-based logistics information portal and an e-commerce platform to provide our clients with services such as logistics services tracking, service rating, online operation, electronic transaction, etc. We expect this information portal to be equally reliable for both service providers and their respective clients.
 
We will also establish an e-commerce system based on the logistics information portal and we will provide clients with many updated services such as online transactions, online payments, online inquiries and business information communication. This will create a comprehensive service system and a business model with high integration of information flow, capital flow, trade flow and goods flow.
 
Portside Service
 
We also plan to provide incentives for companies that specialize in IT, production of new material and high-end equipment and manufacturing companies to station nearby the Logistics Center so that these companies can grow with the Logistics Center, leveraging each other’s specialization to serve each other’s business needs.
Logistics Financing
 
Logistics financing is mainly based on using supplies as collateral to obtain financing for supply chains to improve its overall economic efficiency. Developing an innovative logistics financing is significant because traditionally mortgages or loans are concentrated in real estate and logistics financing provides a lower systematic risk for lenders.
 
Compared to developed countries, we believe that logistics financing is a rather new field in China. The driving force for logistics financial service in western countries is mainly attributable to financial institutions as opposed to third-party private logistics companies in China who would occasionally provide financing options.
 
Logistics financial services became a popular investment vehicle among these third-party lenders. However, the business of logistics financing has become more complex for these private lenders to handle as they will need professionals to guide them through the process and thus safeguard their investments.
 
Even though the history of logistics financing has been relatively short in China, the appetite for this is expected to grow as the Free Trade Zones in Shanghai, Tianjin and soon-to-be Wuhan will likely attract more business and international financial institutions. Logistics financing not only provides businesses with a new alternative to meet their capital needs, but also opens a new channel for commercial banks to reach small and mid-size businesses. While interest income generated from logistics financing transaction is often an important source of income for many multinational logistics companies, companies who are able to provide financing are often the industry leaders. Because logistics financing can be an effective channel for the Company to reach its targeted market, we plan to capture this first-mover advantage when logistics financing is still in its development stage in China.
 
In light of this market opportunity, we plan to establish and utilize e-commerce platforms to offer online booking, online dealing and online exhibiting services to provide professional transaction services for electronic products, commodity, foods and metals. We also plan to provide comprehensive support services to complement logistics financing. Maritime insurance and training services will be offered within the Logistic Center. We plan to help our clients to raise construction capital through Build-Transfer (“BT”), Build-Operate-Transfer (“BOT”), corporate debt and equity financing. Finally, we plan to collaborate and develop strategic alliances with other logistics or cargo shipping centers around the world. 
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We plan to sell our commercial properties by forming strategic alliances with CMST Development (Hankou) Co. Ltd. (“CMST-Hankou”), the Shanxi Chamber of Commerce in Hubei (“SCCH”) and the Wuhan Coal Business Association (“WCBA”).

Partnership with CMST
 
CMST-Hankou is a regional subsidiary of the CMST Development Co. Ltd, which is a state-owned enterprise that principally engages in the logistics and import & export businesses. CMST-Hankou’s core business includes warehouse storage, sale and distribution of commodities, and freight forwarding. Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding executed with CMST-Hankou on August 20, 2015, CMST-Hankou has agreed to transfer all of its warehouse storage and processing division, distribution service division and other existing businesses to the premises of the Logistics Center. In addition, CMST-Hankou has agreed to move its warehouse for steel trading business with the Shanghai Future Exchange to the Logistics Center. In consideration, we have agreed to offer CMST-Hankou a 5% discount on all services provided within the Logistics Center, including those within the warehouses, port terminal, and railway operating zones. In addition, CMST-Hankou has agreed to assist the Company with the establishment of an online commodity exchange platform to provide a comprehensive support system through the supply chain and provide necessary personnel to help with the management of the warehouse operations within the Logistics Center. Though at a slight discount, the Company is expected to receive fees based on CMST-Hankou’s large volume of commodities that need to be stored and use of complementary services at the warehouse facilities and operating areas, as well as rental income and/or property sales generated from the office complex. However, the partnership is subject to the terms and conditions of a definitive agreement between CMST-Hankou and the Company. No assurances can be provided at this point that such a definitive agreement will be executed.
 
Partnership with SCCH
 
SCCH is a non-profit business coalition with 252 businesses across various industries as members. Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding executed with SCCH on July 27, 2015, SCCH has agreed to move its headquarters to the office complex within the Logistics Center by purchasing or leasing certain units. In consideration of a 7% discount to the purchase price of $2,729 per square meter of our properties, approximately 50 businesses within the organization plan to open offices in the Logistics Center and purchase at least 100,000 square meters of space within the office complex. SCCH, on behalf of 50 businesses, also executed a letter of intent to purchase approximately 100,000 square meters of storefront. In addition, because we expect the 50 businesses to have a total annual turnover of commodities of more than 5,000,000 tons, we have agreed to offer members of SCCH a 5% discount on all services provided within the Logistics Center, including those within the warehouses, port terminal, and railway operating zones. However, the partnership is subject to the terms and conditions of a definitive agreement between SCCH and the Company. No assurances can be provided at this point that such a definitive agreement will be executed.
 
Partnership with WCBA
 
WCBA is a non-profit business coalition with more than 300 businesses within the coal mining industry as members. Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding executed with WCBA on September 17, 2015, WCBA has agreed to move its headquarters to the office complex within the Logistics Center by purchasing or leasing certain units. We have agreed to offer WCBA member businesses a 5% discount to the purchase price of $2,729 per square meter of our properties. In addition, because we expect WCBA members to have a total annual turnover of coal-related commodities of more than 20,000,000 tons and will use the Company’s warehouse storage for at least 3,000,000 tons, we have agreed to offer members of WCBA a 5% discount on all services provided within the Logistics Center, including those within the warehouses, port terminal, and railway operating zones. However, the partnership is subject to the terms and conditions of a definitive agreement between WCBA and the Company. No assurances can be provided at this point that such a definitive agreement will be executed.  
 
Market Opportunity for Logistics Finance
 
Logistics financing provides financial services such as financing, clearance and insurance to support the logistics industry. It evolves as the logistics industry develops. Not only can logistics financing services improve the service capability and increase the profitability of third party logistics companies; it can also expand financing channels, decrease financing cost and increase the capital efficiency.

The major target clients for logistics finance services are small and medium sized companies, which are an important sector of China’s economy and have great weight in the market. One of the biggest hurdles in the life cycle of these small and medium sized companies is lack of cash flow, which can become the “bottle neck” of their development and prevent progress. The need for logistics financing results from the lack of available credit financing facilities and the difficulty of obtaining financing on the capital markets. Therefore, logistics financing services protect against the financing problems by allowing these small and medium companies to use their raw materials and commodities as collateral to borrow money. Logistics financing increases the liquidity of cash flow, lowers the clearance risks and improves the efficiency of the economic operation. Upon completion of the Logistics Center, we expect to house many small and mid-size logistics companies. The offering of logistics financing will therefore become an important component of the business, as these businesses are expected to have financing needs as they grow their businesses.
 
Market Overview of Wuhan
 
Located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Wuhan has been regarded as the gateway to nine provinces nearby. Beijing-Guangzhou Railway and the Yangtze River converge in Wuhan and also Beijing-Jiulong Railway and Beijing-Guangzhou Railway intersect in it, thus forming a railway network linking North China, Southwest China, Central South China and East China. Moreover, Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway and Shanghai-Chengdu Expressway converge in Wuhan and a high-speed railway along the Yangtze River will be completed here soon. Therefore, a “flexible multimodal transportation system” combining expressways, high-speed railways and water transportation on the Yangtze River will give greater prominence to Wuhan’s position of strategic importance as a junction of water and land transportation in China (Source: http://www.maxxelli-blog.com/introduction-to-wuhan/).
 
Wuhan is the largest inland logistics and cargo distribution center in China, with its service covering approximately a 400 million population in the five neighboring provinces including Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan and Sichuan. At present, there are over 10,000 commercial organizations, 105,000 commodity networks, four commercial listed enterprises as well as eight comprehensive shopping centers on the list of China Top 100 Retail Shopping Centers (Source: http://www.maxxelli-blog.com/introduction-to-wuhan/). 
 
China is thoroughly implementing the strategy of coordinated regional development, expanding domestic demand, innovation-driven development and new urbanization, and building a new economic support belt relying on the Yangtze River. As a central city in the central region and the middle reach of the Yangtze River, and the country’s major transportation hub and science and technology base, Wuhan faces multiple overlapping strategic opportunities. Location, transportation, science, education, market and other advantages will be further enhanced and fully released and more quickly transformed into development and competitive advantage (Source: http://www.maxxelli-blog.com/introduction-to-wuhan/).
 
Wuhan is a major transportation hub of China situated at the midstream of the Yangtze River. Going west alongside the Yangtze, upstream are the cities in Chongqing, Sichuan, Yunnan and Qinghai. Going east downstream are provinces of Hunan, Anhui and Jiangsu, as well as the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, until finally arriving at the sea. The railway runs north bound to Harbin, westbound to Urumqi, east bound to Shanghai and south bound to the Shenzhen Highway and expressways that stretch in all directions ensuring easy and convenient transportation to all provinces in China. Likewise, Wuhan is largest economic city in central China with an annual GDP beyond 1,000 billion RMB.  In 2015, the China State Council introduced and implemented the Midstream Yangtze River City Group Development Plan headed by Wuhan. In fact, the city was once called “The Oriental Chicago” by the US Harper’s Magazine back in 1918.
 
With the rapid development of inland water shipping in China, logistics and port management industry has grown significantly. Wuhan is one of the major inland water ports in China. In 2014, Wuhan government released an Opinion On Accelerating The Establishment Of Shipping Center In The Middle Reach Of Yangtze River, and indicated that the government will help the Wuhan shipping center to be a well-equipped, surrounding industry developed internationally with a scaled and intelligent inland water shipping center with highly concentrated port and shipping resources . In the Development Plan On Wuhan Logistics Space (2012-2020), Wuhan is strategically positioned as the critical joint of the global supply chain and the logistics transportation hub and information center of China.

However, in Wuhan, logistics for domestic trade operate separately from that for international trade and all resources are scattered and not concentrated enough to form a well-organized and well-managed international supply chain. It is very difficult for Wuhan to realize the synergy of business, logistics, money and information. In addition, a majority of the current logistics companies in Wuhan focus on traditional cargo transportation and storage services. Therefore, there exists an opportunity for an efficient, comprehensive and modern logistics service center to facilitate the channel of both regional and global logistics.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
The following factors reflect our advantages over our competitors:
 

● | Experienced Logistics Management Team. We have a professional team with significant experience in logistics management. Members of the Company’s team have had work experience with well-known logistics management companies in different cities.

● | Encouraging Policy Environment. Under China’s latest “One Belt, One Road” initiative, we are strategically positioned in the anticipated “Pilot Free Trade Zone” of the Wuhan port, a crucial trading window between China, the Middle East and Europe. In May 2015, the China State Council approved the nation’s economic strategic plan, the Vigorous Development Plan of Yangtze River Economic Belt. The Yangtze River Economic Belt has sharpened the focus on the Wuhan New Port Yangluo Terminal, where the port project that we are currently developing is located.

● | Unique Transportation Network. Wuhan is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, east facing south-eastern coastal economic developed area and west linking north-western raw material base. The distance to metropolitan cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Chongqing are within 1,200 kilometers. As a central city in mainland China, Wuhan is capable of reaching over 30 provinces like Yunnan Province, Henan Province, Sichuan Province, Shanxi Province, Jiangxi Province and Hunan Province and 600 cities and counties in China.

● | Waterway: The project adjacent to the Yangluo deep-water port, has eight 5,000-ton berths, directly leading to Jianghai. Yangluo Port is the largest national shipping port in Central China and the largest container port in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. We will be strategically located for international procurement, distribution and delivery.
