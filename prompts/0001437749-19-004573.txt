Moreover, we expanded our DECT solutions beyond cordless telephony to address the IoT market via an ultra low energy version of DECT called DECT ULE or ULE. ULE offers numerous technological benefits due to its licensed and interference-free bands, longer range, RF robustness, propagation through multiple walls, voice and visual support, while operating at very low power.
 
In the past decade, we have expanded from primarily delivering cordless telephony solutions serving consumers to chipses and telephony solutions for office and business applications, and have become a market leader in this growing segment. Today, DSP Group offers comprehensive systems-on-a-chip (SoC) and solution for VoIP, home, SoHo and office IP phones. VoIP is a technology that enables users to make HD voice calls via a broadband Internet connection rather than an analog phone line. Through successful penetration with tier one customers, we achieved over 11% growth in 2018 in the Office segment.
 
Furthermore, with speech-enabled mobile, smart assistants and IoT devices playing an increasingly significant role in peoples’ lives, in February 2013, we unveiled our HDClear technology. We have incorporated this HDClear technology into our SmartVoice product family consisting of a comprehensive suite of noise suppression and voice quality enhancement products for mobile, wearables and always-on IoT devices. HDClear capitalizes on the voice user interface trend by incorporating voice command, voice activation, proprietary noise cancellation, acoustic echo cancellation, and beam forming algorithms, thereby dramatically improving user experience and delivering unparalleled voice quality and speech recognition. Our HDClear technology is both high performance and ultra-low power. This technology was conceived through internal development combined with the acquisition of BoneTone Communications Ltd. (“BoneTone”) and the addition of their innovative intelligent noise cancellation algorithms to our low power SoC. In 2015, we secured our first design win for HDClear with a tier one mobile customer and started mass production shipments during the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2016, we shipped our HDClear hardware and software solution in mass production to a tier one mobile customer for one of its flagship mobile phones. In 2017, we shipped our HDClear solution to two flag ship mobile phones and eight different OEMs for non-mobile phone applications. In 2018, we shipped our solution to over a dozen smartphone, IoT, wearable and computing OEMs, and achieved over 124% year-over-year growth in the SmartVoice segment.
 
Committed to advancing technology across the CE and telecommunications markets, DSP Group is actively involved in prominent industry associations, including the DECT Forum, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, ULE Alliance and the Wi-Fi Alliance. We also participate in the 3GPP and MIPI alliance. DSP Group is further deeply involved in all stages of defining DECT CAT-iq and ULE standards and is building full eco-systems to support these solutions. We are also an active member of the Home Gateway Initiative (HGI). Such industry involvements enable us to participate in the definition of standards and keep abreast of the latest innovations, and market and technology requirements. We also maintain close relationships with many world-leading telecommunication service providers, thereby providing us with insight into future plans across the industry.

SmartVoice - Products Targeted at Mobile Telephony, Consumer Electronics, IoT and Wearable Device Markets 
 
Our SmartVoice product portfolio encompasses HDClear technology for intelligent voice enhancement, always-on voice trigger and control, and noise elimination. This technology is primarily targeted at devices supporting voice as a user interface. The current market trend is for mobile and IoT devices to use voice as a user interface. Our HDClear high performance and lower power solutions continue to garner important design wins with our numerous enabling technologies such as voice command, voice activation, proprietary noise cancellation, acoustic echo cancellation and beam forming algorithms, all of which dramatically improve user experience and deliver world class voice quality and speech recognition.
 
HDClear-based solutions offer mobile IoT voice quality and intelligibility, while minimizing background noise. Delivering clearer voice calls made from noisy environments, HDClear also maximizes accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) applications in noisy environments by leveraging robust and powerful noise cancellation algorithms. HDClear more effectively isolates voice from ambient noise, thereby drastically lowering Word Error Rate (WER) and dramatically improving the user experience for speech-enabled applications like virtual assistants, voice search, speakerphone conference calls and speech-to-text on mobile and wearable devices, tablets and other consumer devices.
 
In 2012, we taped-out the DBMD2 chip, which we believe is one of the most efficient voice enhancement processors in the market. DBMD2’s low power enables an always-on voice feature for mobile devices. Always-on is a low power decisive natural voice interface for mobile and wearable devices. An average user accesses his/her device tens or hundreds of times per day by physically pressing a screen or a button. A truly always-on technology enables the user to skip this step by using natural voice to access the device even while the device is in standby mode. DBMD2 enables mobile OEMs to offload voice and audio tasks from mobile device CPUs, in addition to running HDClear to enhance automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. OEM and ODM customers can leverage DBMD2’s open and flexible architecture to differentiate their products to run their own voice/audio enhancement software for pre- and post-processing.
 
In 2015, we started commercial shipments of DBMD2 for a wearable device with a leading OEM. That year, we also taped-out DBMD4, a chip targeted for ultra-low-power, always-on voice and audio applications. DBMD4 incorporates a suite of voice enhancement algorithms, including noise suppression, that significantly improves user experience and accuracy of speech-driven applications, particularly in high noise environments. Offered in a small form factor, DBMD4 embeds a TeakLite-III DSP core, incorporates advanced connectivity options, including I2S, UART, SPI, I2C ports and SLIMbus, and is equipped with a comprehensive software framework that enables rapid development and fast time-to-market, thereby overcoming the challenges of portable design, real estate and power consumption.
 
In 2016, we went into production with our design win for our DBMD4 chip with a tier one mobile customer. This win led to significant year-over-year revenue growth in our SmartVoice segment. In the second half of 2016, we announced two additional design wins for our HDClear in non-smartphone applications that went into production in the second half of 2017.
 
In January 2017, we unveiled our latest audio and voice enhancement SoC, the DBMD5. This audio SoC is built to drive clearer human machine voice interactions in multi microphone equipped devices.
 
2018 was a milestone year for SmartVoice in which we shipped our SoCs to customers in six different categories – smartphones, IoT, wearables, hearables, tablets and speakers. In addition, during the year, market-leading Amazon Alexa Voice Services certified our far field 3-Mic development kit based on our DBMD5 processor. We are currently working on our next generation voice enhancement SoC which we expect to introduce in 2019.

While our ability to compete may be affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property, we believe that because of the rapid pace of technological change in our industry, our technical expertise and ability to innovate on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner will be at least as important in maintaining our competitive position than the protection of our intellectual property. In addition, we believe that due to rapid technological changes in residential telephony, computer telephony and personal computer markets, patents and trade secret protection are important but must be supported by other factors, including expanding the knowledge, ability and experience of our personnel, new product introductions and frequent product enhancements. Although we continue to implement protective measures and intend to defend our intellectual property rights vigorously, we cannot assure that these measures will be successful.
 
Backlog
 
At December 31, 2018, our backlog was approximately $22.4 million, compared to approximately $20.6 million and $23.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We include in our backlog all accepted product purchase orders with respect to which a delivery schedule has been specified for product shipment within one year and for which collectability is not considered a risk. Our business is characterized by short-term order and shipment schedules. Product orders in our current backlog are subject to change, sometimes on short notice, due to changes in delivery schedules or cancellation by a purchaser. Accordingly, although useful for scheduling production, backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of our sales for any future period.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we had 320 employees, including 193 in research and development, 66 in sales and marketing, and 61 in corporate, administration and manufacturing coordination. Competition for personnel in the semiconductor industry in general is intense. We believe that our future prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain sought after, highly-skilled technical, marketing and management personnel and are taking active measures to ensure we are perceived as a sought after employer. In particular, there is a limited supply of RF chip designers and highly-qualified engineers with digital signal processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence experience. We believe that we provide an excellent culture and competitive compensation to retain our valuable employees.
