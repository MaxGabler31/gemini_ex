Overview



We are a medical robotics company developing a fully autonomous medical robotic system using proprietary software which integrates Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Deep Learning, or machine learning, (“DL”). By using an AI and DL enhanced software program, we are creating an intelligent robotic system that we believe can “robotize” a wide range of medical procedures currently being performed by human hands. We are concentrating our research and development efforts to meet rising expectations of patients and practitioners alike for the precision, safety and speed offered by an AI enhanced robotics platform system that can be combined with proven medical devices, end-effectors and surgical instruments.



We believe that progress in mechanical and software engineering has made possible lightweight and relatively inexpensive robotic devices for difficult procedures in various medical fields. Medical robots are already being successfully employed in several areas of surgery, including Urology (Prostate), Colo-Rectal, Gynecology, Thoracic, General Surgery, Orthopedics, and Neuro and Spine Surgery. Robots are also being used for Telemedicine and assistive robotic methods are addressing the delivery of healthcare in inaccessible locations, ranging from rural areas lacking specialist expertise to post-disaster scenarios, and battlefield areas. With the aging population dominating demographics in the U.S. across all spectrums of healthcare, robotic technologies are being developed toward promoting improved function, lower morbidity and improved overall outcomes.



We are developing a treatment-independent autonomous robotics system utilizing our proprietary AI-driven precision guidance system, applicable to a variety of minimally and non-invasive procedures, with an initial focus on skin resurfacing aesthetic procedures utilizing several FDA approved skin enhancing techniques robotized for superior performance and optimal results. Our medical robotic system is being developed to deliver skin resurfacing treatments, such as micro-needling and laser therapies with improved efficiency, accuracy and precision over current procedures conducted by human hand, and only requiring the doctor to input or just confirm treatment parameters. As a result, use of our medical robotic system is expected to provide improved quality and safety as well as improve patient throughput and workflow.



Our autonomous medical robotics system is being developed to be compatible with available FDA approved surgical tools and end-effectors, enabling us to initially penetrate a sizable and fast-growing aesthetics market, which includes micro-needling and laser solutions. Our robotics system will allow doctors, and anyone permitted to treat patients, defined at the State level, such as a licensed aesthetician, to treat damaged skin autonomously by delivering, for example, micro-needling to the skin. The micro-needling catalyzes the natural process of collagen remodeling, consisting of formation of new collagen, elastin, and vascularization in the papillary dermis, similar to the effect of laser treatments.



We expect our robotic system to eliminate many of the common errors that occur during handheld procedures, such as over- or under- exposure of the needles or energy-based instruments that can have terrible cosmetic results and even injure the patient. In addition, our system is being designed to continuously adjust treatment parameters, such as penetration depth, time, and energy in order to individualize the outcome based on our algorithms. Our robotic system has been designed and developed through a seamless collaboration of the surgeon, the engineer and the scientist. Since the medical robotic industry has progressed greatly in miniaturization, adaptability and lower costs, we believe that the Avra “brains” technology component can lead to dramatic opportunities in all of medicine.



The advantages of robotizing already FDA approved aesthetic devices are many. In contrast to a human using a handheld device, our aesthetics robotic system has the potential to perform each and every procedure with unsurpassed precision without constraint of age, proficiency, experience or fatigue. Likewise, in many skin related treatments the amount of energy delivered, distance and/or depth of the instrument to, or into, the skin, and treating only the affected area are critical to the outcome. The robotic system can maintain these parameters with unparalleled accuracy. The system can also replicate the same procedure time and again precisely. Delivery of certain aesthetic treatments by robotic systems is believed to be the most efficient option, requiring fewer visits per patient while increasing patient throughput — a benefit for patients and practitioners alike.

We believe that our initial medical robotic system for the aesthetics market should find rapid acceptance based on the aforementioned advantages of using the attribute of robotics versus traditional manual applications. Furthermore, there is general acceptance by consumers for fee-for-service cash payments in the facial aesthetics market thereby avoiding medical insurance reimbursement issues. Our medical robotic system utilizes a robotic arm that has 7-degrees of freedom integrated with our proprietary AI-driven control software and algorithms. The robotic arm was designed and built under the required medical device standards of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). Our strategy is to integrate the robotic arm with FDA approved devices, which is expected to allow for a more expedited approval of the integrated system. We believe that the FDA approval process will primarily focus upon validation of the medical robotic system’s software control. This could lead to a less onerous, more de-risked regulatory path to approval, particularly if strong preclinical results are achieved. Subsequent to the completion of the FDA preclinical work, estimated to take six months, we believe that we will be able to additionally modify and robotize certain non-invasive instruments that do not require FDA approvals and proceed to the cosmetic treatments marketplace. This action could sharply reduce the time to commercial operations and revenues.



We previously retained the services of The Horizon Phoenix Group (“HPG”), a consulting firm experienced in securing U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals for medical devices, in order to initiate the regulatory process. Working with HPG, we prepared and filed an application with the FDA for our initial medical robotic system and in August 2019 held an initial pre-collaboration meeting with the FDA. We believe that this is the first of a series of meetings where the Avra system and its regulatory requirements will be discussed in ever-increasing specificity. This should allow for a more focused regulatory process, saving both resources and time. The robotic arm that we intend to utilize for our system has already been granted approval in the EU and received a CE mark. We have begun implementing a quality and regulatory system that will serve as the foundation for U.S., Canadian, European, Australian, Japanese, and Brazilian market access for our medical robotic system. The Medical Device Single Audit Program(“MDSAP”), which we plan to employ, is a single inspection that, when completed, is expected to support market access to these six most important medical device marketplaces.



Since 2016, we had a research partnership with the University of Central Florida (“UCF”) to develop a prototype intelligent medical robotic system. UCF is recognized particularly for its work in the area of medical robotic research and design, with a focus on the guidance systems. Avra has paid UCF a one-time fee for outright ownership of work developed by UCF in the collaboration. The Research Agreement was extended several times and expired on April 30, 2021. To further the depth of our research and development we also began a partnership in 2021 with Florida Polytechnic University and are actively working with them on developing our system. Avra recently brought in two Associate Professors and three graduates to join Avra’s engineering development team. Effective October 11th, 2021 Avra executed a Sponsored Student Project Agreement which includes two payments of $8,030 each covering Fall semester in 2021 and Spring semester in 2022.

On September 10, 2019, we entered into a collaborative research and development agreement with Infinite Mind, LLC, now known as Avra Air, LLC (“Avra Air”). Avra Air is in the business of developing computerized systems for robot operation and automation employing software and AI for applications in various industries and has more recently expanded to the development of air sanitizing devices to help address such pathogens as COVID-19. Our CEO is also an owner of Avra Air. Avra Air, with the use of Avra’s facilities and cooperation of Avra personnel, will seek to develop software and AI systems for robots that are relevant to the field of medical treatment or diagnostics. As part of the collaboration, Avra Air has granted Avra an exclusive, worldwide, full paid-up, perpetual, royalty-free license to commercialize any technology (including any patents) developed by Avra Air individually or jointly with Avra during the term of the agreement as well as existing technology of AVRA AIR in the field of medical robotics. This license survives termination of the agreement.



On November 6, 2020, AVRA made an investment of $210,000 in Avra Air which was made with $40,000 in cash and the balance by the issuance to Avra Air of 472,222 restricted shares of our common stock valued at $0.36 per share. In exchange for the investment. Avra received (a) a 49.8% limited liability company membership interest in Avra Air; and (b) the remaining 50% of a vehicular air sterilization provisional patent that Avra did not yet control. In addition, Avra also agreed to pay Avra Air a royalty payment of $1.50 per vehicular air sterilization kit for two years from the date that a first kit that uses the patent is sold. On December 22, 2020, the Company issued 472,222 shares of its common stock towards the acquisition of its interest in Avra Air. Avra Air has recently built a prototype portable air de-contaminant system which it plans to market soon.



Recent Developments



On August 5, 2022, AVRA entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Dr. Sudhir Srivastava (“Dr. Sudhir”), Cardio Ventures Pvt. Ltd., a Bahamian private limited company of which Dr. Sudhir is the sole stockholder(“Cardio”), Otto Pvt, Ltd., a Bahamian private limited company and direct subsidiary of Cardio (“Otto”) and Sudhir Srivastava Innovations Pvt. Ltd., an Indian private limited company and indirect subsidiary of Cardio (“SSI,” and together with Cardio and Otto, the “SSI Parties”) with respect to a business combination between AVRA and the SSI Parties (the “Transaction”). SSI, based in Haryana, India is engaged in the development, commercialization, manufacturing and sale of medical and surgical robotic systems utilizing patents, trademarks and other intellectual property held by Dr. Sudhir (the “SSI Intellectual Property”).



If and when the transaction is consummated, the business of the SSI Parties, including the SSI Intellectual Property will be owned by AVRA. The shareholders of the SSI Parties will own 95% of the common stock of post-transaction AVRA and the current shareholders of AVRA will own 5% of the common stock of post-transaction AVRA. In addition, there will be changes in composition of the board of directors, implementation of corporate governance policies and changes in management, all with a view to listing the common stock of AVRA on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC or another National Securities Exchange. In addition, AVRA will change its name to “SS Innovations, Inc.”



Consummation of the Transaction is subject to, among other matters, the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements and documentation, containing, in addition to the above terms, terms and conditions customary for agreements of this type and nature, including, without limitation, representations, warranties, and indemnities of the parties.



Consummation of the Transaction is also subject to completion of a due diligence review by each party of the other, the results of which shall be satisfactory to the reviewing parties in their sole discretion.



Given the foregoing, there can be no assurance given that the Company will be able to successfully complete the Transaction.



In connection with executing the letter of intent, we advanced the SSI Parties, the amount of $900,000 (the “Interim Financing”). The Interim Financing is evidenced by a one-year $1,000,000 Automatically Convertible Note made in favor of the Company by Cardio, Otto and Dr Sudhir, jointly and severally (the “Cardio Note”). Interest on the Cardio Note shall accrue at the rate of 7% per annum, payable together with the principal amount at maturity. The Cardio Note has an original issue discount of 10%. If the Cardio Note is not repaid in full on or at maturity, it will automatically convert into a percentage equity interest in Cardio determined by dividing the principal amount of and accrued interest on the Cardio Note divided by $100 million. The Cardio Note contains customary default provisions and other typical terms and conditions.

We may make additional advances to the SSI Parties of up to an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 of Interim Financing, evidenced by additional Cardio Notes. These Cardio Notes will be substantially similar in form and substance to the first Cardio Note, provided, however, that Cardio Notes issued in excess of an aggregate principal amount of $2.000,000, will have an original issue discount of 6% as opposed to 10%, and the valuation for determining conversion will be $250 million as opposed to $100 million.



In order to fund the Interim Financing, the Company offered and sold to a single accredited investor, a $1,000,000 one-year convertible promissory note (the “Convertible Note”). The Convertible Note will have the same interest rate and payment terms as the Cardio Note and otherwise be substantially similar to the Cardio Note, provided, however, that the Convertible Note does not have an original issue discount. Further, upon consummation of the Transaction (if and when it is consummated) the Convertible Note will automatically convert into a number of AVRA Shares determined by dividing the principal amount of the Convertible Note by $100 million and multiplying such number expressed as a percentage by the number of AVRA Shares issued to Dr. Sudhir and the other shareholders of the SSI Parties (if any) upon closing of the Transaction. The Company may offer and sell up to an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 in Convertible Notes in order to fund the Interim Financing.



The Convertible Note was issued in a private transaction pursuant to the exemptions from registration under the Section 4(a)2 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

Medical Robotic and Skin Rejuvenation Markets



The United States is expected to see a shortage of nearly 122,000 physicians by 2032 as demand for physicians continues to grow faster than supply, according to new data published by the AAMC (Association of American Medical Colleges). This trend is unfortunately being seen in the rest of the world as well. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) estimates that there is a global shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. The shortage is often starkest in developing nations due to the limited numbers and capacity of medical schools in these countries.



One solution that is expected to mitigate this shortage will be the growing use of robotic systems for both their ability to be used remotely by the doctor (i.e. a doctor could, from a central location, cover anywhere in the world given proper connectivity), but also for their ability to increase the efficiency of existing practitioners. The ever-growing high cost of healthcare is also a driver for the growth in the use of robotic systems.



Advantages of using medical robotics include:




● | Reduced cost per treatment 
--+-------------------------------


● | Better treatment accuracy 
--+------------------------------


● | Better treatment outcomes 
--+------------------------------


● | Increase patient throughput 
--+--------------------------------


● | Easier multi-platform integration 
--+--------------------------------------


● | Addresses shortfall of physicians/surgeons 
--+-----------------------------------------------




The concept of using a robot in surgical procedures became a practical reality in 2000, when the FDA approved the da Vinci® robotic system, introduced to the market by Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (“ISRG”). For years, ISRG was essentially the sole company manufacturing and marketing robotic devices for use in the rapidly emerging field of robotic assisted, minimally invasive surgery.



Today, the U.S. is the leader in robot-assisted surgery. However, other countries are fast followers, having already recognized both the need and the promise of such technologies. The development of surgical robotics is motivated by the desire to enhance the effectiveness of a procedure by coupling information to action in the operating room or interventional suite and transcend human physical limitations in performing surgery and other interventional procedures, while still affording human control over the procedure. Two decades after the first reported robot assisted surgical procedure, surgical robots are now being widely used in the operating room. According to Kenneth Research, the worldwide medical robotics market is projected to reach $11.36 billion by 2023, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 12.6% during 2018–2023.



According to Kenneth Research, North America is currently the world’s largest market for medical robotics, holding an over 40% market share as of 2019, with significant growth expected in the coming years.



Growth in North America is driven by a few factors including the high rate of adoption of these new technologies and the growing demand for more precise, less invasive, and safer surgical methods. The overall growth of this industry is driven by the rising demand for these technologies, the growing and aging population, as well as increasing healthcare expenditures.

Due to the growth in robotics for medical applications over the last several years, the medical robotics space has seen increasing mergers and acquisitions activity and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. Some recent examples include:




● | Medtronic’s acquisition of Mazor Robotics in September 2018 for $1.6 billion. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Johnson & Johnson’s acquisition of Auris Health in February 2019 for $5.75 billion (Johnson & Johnson is now a shareholder of Avra through its ownership of Auris Health, which was one of the founding shareholders of Avra. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stryker’s acquisition of Orthoscape in March 2019 for $220 million. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Intuitive Surgical’s acquisition of Schölly Fiberoptic’s robotic endoscope business in July 2019 for an undisclosed sum. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Siemens Medical Solutions’ acquisition of Corindus Vascular Robotics in August 2019 for $1.1 billion. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Similar to growth in the use of medical robots in various procedures, the demand for skin rejuvenation procedures is also rapidly growing, which is a primary reason why we chose the skin rejuvenation market as our initial point of entry into the medical robotics field. According to a research letter published by Jama Network, in 2016, the total number of dermatology providers was 13,365 (10,845 dermatologists and 2,520 dermatology physician assistants). The global medical aesthetic market is expected to reach $16.7 billion by 2022, with North America remaining the largest single market.



According to the National Laser Institute, between 2000 and 2018, the total number of non-surgical cosmetic treatments performed increased by 228% with 15.9 million non-surgical cosmetic treatments performed in 2018. The National Laser Institute also estimated that over $16.5 billion was spent in the U.S. on cosmetic procedures in 2018.



According to a research study by Persistence Market Research, the global market for skin rejuvenation is projected to reach a CAGR of 8.7%. By region, the North American and Asian Pacific excluding Japan (“APEJ”) regions reflect high potential in the years to come. The North American region is expected to dominate the global market as it is estimated to be the largest and highly attractive for skin rejuvenation. The North American skin rejuvenation market is estimated to reach a CAGR of 9.4% at its peak.



Most products designed to improve the appearance of the skin do not repair the skin itself; rather, they cover and hide scarring and blemishes temporarily. Wrinkles also are challenging as the skin ages and are hard to cover over. Some current treatments aim to slow or forestall the development of wrinkles, but with questionable effectiveness. Micro-needling and laser treatments are two common ablative procedures currently in use today for skin resurfacing, specifically focused on tone, texture and skin tightening. Other platforms include radiofrequency, ultrasound, cryolipolysis, and a multitude of laser frequencies that are available to practitioners.



Micro-needling is used to treat and improve conditions like acne scarring, fine lines and wrinkles, loose skin, skin texture, pore size, brown spots, stretch marks, and pigment issues. It is also called skin needling, collagen induction therapy (“CIT”), and percutaneous collagen induction (“PCI”). Most anyone can have the procedure performed, as long as they do not have any active infections, lesions, or any known wound healing problems.



Micro-needling is typically performed in a series of four to six sessions, spaced about a month apart. During the procedure, a topical anesthetic is applied, and then stainless-steel micro-needles are inserted into the skin to cause microinjuries or punctures. The damage caused by the needles encourages the body to send healing agents (elastin and collagen) to the punctures to repair them. According to a 2008 study, skin treated with four micro-needling sessions spaced one month apart produced up to a 400% increase in collagen and elastin six months after completing treatment.

Laser resurfacing also can shrink wrinkles, even eliminating small wrinkles, by removing the outer layer of skin, allowing new skin to form. While simple, this procedure can be painful. Laser resurfacing works by burning off skin; skin can reach 1500°F (800°C) in the process of being removed, and adjacent areas of skin can approach 400°F. Unsurprisingly, general anesthesia is often required. Open wounds are created and healing may take up to three weeks. Skin redness may persist for three months, during which the skin is particularly sensitive to UV light. Other risks of laser resurfacing include scarring, changes in skin pigmentation and bacterial infection. Most, if not all, of the more severe adverse effects of laser resurfacing treatments are due to errors in the application of the treatment. Applying the laser too close to the skin, for too long on one area of the skin, and at the wrong settings, are just some examples of human errors for this procedure. Robotizing this procedure could reduce, if not eliminate, these human errors.



A recent study by Yongsoo Lee, M.D., co-CEO and co-founder, Oh and Lee Medical Robot, Inc., in South Korea, presented at the American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery meeting held in April 2017, comparing the improvements in the evenness of laser irradiation using a robot versus manual irradiation found the robot-guided treatment to be much more accurate than the human hand, achieving superior outcomes. Results of the study showed that robotic irradiation demonstrated consistency in distances between beams and distribution in fractions at both 30 and 10 Hz frequencies and was significantly superior to manual irradiation in the ratio of area covered by beams to regions of interest, distances between beams, and distribution in fractions at each frequency. The investigators concluded the robot-guided treatment to be superior to the manually guided treatment.



“As an aesthetic dermatologist myself, I can appreciate that virtually all doctors would welcome the robot-guided treatments, as valuable time can be saved in the busy practice. That saved time can then be invested in other patients and procedures, allowing physicians to see more patients per day. Moreover, due to the heightened precision of robotic-guided treatments, cosmetic treatments are much safer with a significantly reduced chance of adverse events occurring such as burns and spotty hypopigmentation,” Dr. Lee said.



Technology Overview



Current robots used in surgery are under the direct control of a surgeon — the so-called “Master-slave system”, often in a teleoperation scenario in which a human operator manipulates a master input device and the patient-side robot follows the input. There is no autonomy. Traditional minimally invasive surgical robots provide the surgeon with a higher degree of dexterity inside the body, eliminate operator tremor, scale down operator motions to a fraction of normal distances, and provide a very intuitive connection between the operator and the instrument tips. The surgeon can cut, cauterize, suture and reconstruct tissue with accuracy equal to or better than that of invasive open surgery. A surgical system contains both robotic devices and real-time imaging devices to visualize the operative field during the course of surgery.



The use of robotics in medicine inherently involves physical interaction between caregivers, patients, and robots — in all combinations.



Developing user-friendly physical interfaces between humans and robots requires all the classic elements of a robotic system: sensing, perception, and action. A great variety of sensing and perception tasks are required, including recording the motions and forces of a surgeon to infer their intent, determining the mechanical parameters of human tissue, and estimating the forces between a robot and a moving patient. The reciprocal nature of interaction means that the robot will also need to provide useful feedback to the human operator, whether that person is a caregiver or a patient. We need to consider systems that involve many human senses, the most common of which are vision, haptics (force and tactile), and sound. A major reason why systems involving physical collaboration between humans and robots are so difficult to design well is that, from the perspective of a robot, humans are extremely uncertain and dynamic.



Unlike in a passive, static environment, humans dynamically change their motion, force, and immediate purpose throughout a procedure. These changes can be caused by something as simple as physiologic movement (e.g., a patient breathing during surgery), or as complex as the motions of a surgeon suturing during surgery. During physical interaction with a robot, the human is an integral part of a closed-loop feedback system, simultaneously exchanging information and energy with the robotic system, and thus cannot simply be thought of as an external system input.





7







In addition, the loop is often closed with both human force and visual feedback, each with its own errors and delays that can potentially cause challenges in a human-robot system. Given these problems, how does one guarantee safe, collaborative and useful physical interaction between robots and humans? To date, no existing systems provide the user with an ideal experience of physically interacting with a robot. Device design and control are essential to the operation of all medical and health robots, since they interact physically with their environment.



Accordingly, one of the most important technical challenges is in the area of mechanisms. Miniaturization is challenging in large part because current electromechanical actuators (the standard because of their desirable controllability and power to weight ratio) are relatively large. Biological analogs (e.g., human muscles) are far superior to engineered systems in terms of compactness, energy efficiency, low impedance, and high force output. Interestingly, these biological systems often combine “mechanisms” and “actuation” into an integrated, inseparable system. Goals for systems that achieve high dexterity at any scale will naturally differ greatly depending on the medical application (e.g. surgery, rehabilitation, and prosthetics).



We are focusing on truly innovative technology that is in line with current applications, but delivers an innovative approach. We are integrating image-guidance with navigation, AI, and organ-targeting to bring a system that is truly diverse and multi-dimensional. Having identified limitations in the predominantly non-autonomous robotic systems, we propose a disruptive model, which considers design and development through a seamless collaboration of the surgeon, the engineer and the scientist.



The core of the design and engineering of our medical robotic system is the AI-driven robotic arm navigation and guidance software which permits the system to autonomously guide a medical, surgical grade robotic arm and end-effector for safer and more effective treatment of patients. Our initial medical robotic system is designed to perform minimally invasive, surgical facial corrections using a micro-needling device for skin resurfacing. We plan to quickly follow this up with a laser end-effector, a tool useable for various skin resurfacing procedures. This modular approach should allow us to quickly adopt future technologies and instruments with only minor adaptations to the end-effectors and surgical tools approved for use.



The key technology in our system is the Avra Intelligent Instrument Guidance Software (“AIIGS”), an image-guided robotic guidance system that receives real-time 3D images, live sensor inputs from various subsystems to calculate precise orientation of the arm and end-effector over the patient in real-time during a procedure, ultimately allowing precision delivery of treatment to any area of the human body that is beyond the capabilities of a human being, and which should allow for more optimal and consistent treatments. The various image capture and sensor subsystems are outlined below and include, 2D image capture, 3D image capture and tracking, distance sensors, and touch sensors. We expect the AIIGS capability should then be relatively easily employed to support other surgical procedures beyond skin resurfacing, such as skin and wound care, drug delivery, tattoo removal, cellulite reduction, biopsies and Mohs surgery, to name a few.



In the case of facial micro-needling, through our proprietary intuitive graphic user interface, the doctor will be able to acquire a high-resolution depth map of the patient’s face and superimpose a trajectory map over Aesthetic Regions-of-Interest (“AROIs”). The doctor would then accept the suggested treatment protocol or assign specific micro-needling parameters to each AROI. AIIGS will autonomously control the arm and end-effector to follow a predetermined path based on the doctor’s specified parameters for each AROI, and continuously calculate the current and desired position over the sequential AROIs to ensure the precise treatment parameters are met. It will also reorient the end-effector so it is perpendicular to each AROI to ensure optimal application of micro-needling injection, and with the precise pressure needed, accounting for patient movement in real-time.



Our medical robotic subsystems modules are outlined below. Areas of continuous development work include AI, DL, and medical robotic safety guidelines.



While we plan to continue to develop our own custom robotic arm we are using an existing robotic arm that has been specifically developed under medical device standards and that meets all of our requirements for a robotic arm. The robot is classified as a lightweight robot and is a jointed-arm robot with seven axes. All drive units and current-carrying cables are routed inside the robot. Every axis contains multiple sensors that provide signals for robot control (e.g. position control and impedance control) and that are also used as a protective function for the robot. Every axis is monitored by sensors: axis range sensors ensure that the permissible axis range is adhered to, torque sensors ensure that the permissible axis loads are not exceeded, and temperature sensors monitor the thermal limit values of the electronics.

Our medical robotic system requires high levels of accuracy and repeatability. Repeatability is a measure of the ability of the robot to consistently reach a specified point in 3D space (X, Y, Z). Accuracy is a measure of the distance error between the commanded point and the achieved point. Accuracy can be improved with external sensing, for example proximity, vision system or infra-red.



For skin resurfacing, technological improvements in motors, materials and in high resolution imaging allow for the use of robotic devices to assist the surgeon to autonomously treat damaged skin. Presently, we are not aware of any commercially available robotic devices designed for this application.



Application of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning



Artificial intelligence, or AI, refers to software technologies that make a robot or computer act and think like a human. Some software engineers state that it is only artificial intelligence if it performs as well or better than a human. In this context, when we talk about performance, we mean human computational accuracy, speed, and capacity.



Artificial intelligence includes the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Speech recognition, decision-making, visual perception, for example, are features of human intelligence that artificial intelligence may possess. Translation between languages is another feature.



Humans can “learn as we go along.” In other words, learn from experience. Machines with AI can also do this, which we call machine learning. A neural network is an example of machine learning.



A broad definition of a Deep Learning (“DL”) solution is the implementation of algorithms and techniques that endow machines with the ability to autonomously acquire the skills for executing complex tasks effectively letting robots acquire their own skills over time.



The term “learning” can be equated to an optimization process. Optimizing an objective that reflects the actual fitness of the behavior at accomplishing a specific task, such as a robot learning optimal trajectory, where the objective is to traverse a predetermined trajectory in a timely, safe and efficient manner. Telling our AIIGS system to find the optimal trajectory is a very high-level objective. This cannot be implemented with simple, static equations that control the robotic arm and end-effector, but with a reinforcement-learning algorithm we can discover the behavioral skills that optimize the goal. We will need to choose a “representation” for a behavioral skill.



A representation could be a trajectory, a sequence of points, a motion. The robot could traverse to a specific point, but will do so from its current pose. What if you ask it to go to the same point from a different starting pose? The same sequence will not work. It needs to be more flexible to control a more complex movement. This could be in the form of a feedback controller where it looks at the state, applies a function and outputs the action. The more flexible the representation, the greater number of skills can be learned as it relates to a real-world environment.



One choice for a general, flexible representation is a Large Neural Network (“LNN”) that can represent any function; therefore, they can represent any motor skill. It needs more prior knowledge in order to learn. This is where sensor feedback is used and integrated. These can be cameras, tactile sensors, joint encoders that feed into the LNN, reducing the need to engineer specific perceptions and actions for any input modality.



For non-embodied systems such as image processing and speech processing, machine learning has been used and is very successful. This is primarily due to having good supervision. Learning is very successful when you know what the output should be for a given input.



Deep Learning is a typical machine learning method which we intend to use extensively for the perception and intelligent control of our medical robotic system. We intend to apply a DL approach to detect and recognize facial features and use this information to optimally map, code and plan a trajectory over the individual AROIs virtually superimposed over a patient’s face. This is accomplished through “feature” learning. In machine learning and pattern recognition, a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms in pattern recognition, classification and regression.

DL is typically classified into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.




● | Supervised learning, the most common form of machine learning, where the error is measured between the actual and desired output and assigned a cost function with the goal being to minimize the cost. Supervised learning can be directly applied to the trajectory the arm and end-effector follows to arrive at a specific AROI. Accumulated data will be analyzed and used in future path trajectories. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unsupervised learning does not assign a cost function, but instead aims to find the hidden patterns, structures or features embedded in the collected data. Unsupervised learning can be applied to the specific sequence of movements the arm and end-effector traverses to arrive at a specific AROI at the proper orientation and at the proper pressure. This varies with each patient’s skin type as well as the curvature and location on the face. For example, prior to firing the needles the micro-needling instrument must approach at a perpendicular angle to the specific AROI and make even and consistent contact with the patient’s skin. Our AIIGS will accumulate this information and apply it to future procedures. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In reinforcement learning, a software agent is defined to explore and exploit the space of possible strategies. Feedback in the form of reward or cost from the dynamic environment is referred as the outcome of the chosen action. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




With our medical robotic system, some examples of functionality where DL will be employed are:




● | optimal trajectory of the arm and end-effector based on the size and shape of the patient’s head and face; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | optimal arm manipulation as it traverses the trajectory; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | efficient and safe arm movements; 
--+--------------------------------------


● | optimal approach attitude of the micro-needling instrument as it approaches various topographical sections of the patient’s face; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | optimal treatment protocols such as depth, energy, time for micro-needling for specific skin types and for each AROI. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product Description



There are five key elements to our medical robotic system, all of which can potentially generate revenues:

Regulatory Strategy



Our products and operations will be subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. by the FDA and by similar agencies in other countries or regions in which we may market our medical robotic systems. In order to smooth our market entry a comprehensive regulatory strategy has been devised where we create robust preclinical and clinical data supporting our product’s claims and proving the Avra Medical Robotic Arm is safe and will perform as intended. We plan to employ four tiers of tightly interrelated activities. The specific undertaking in each of the tiers will be coordinated in advance with each regulatory jurisdiction where we intend to offer the product line for sale (the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Brazil, Japan and Australia). The four tiers are:



1. Preclinical testing of the system (the controller, the computer, the arm and the end-effector.) Preclinical testing encompasses testing without using the device on human subjects. Key facets of preclinical testing are electrical safety, EMC and EMI testing; integration testing of the system elements and the development of a clinical training program.



2. Software involves all elements of the arm’s operations. The documentation required to demonstrate safety and effectiveness is comprehensive. Each task within a process is mapped and controlled. A risk matrix is established to guide the software development and also to play the pivotal role in verification, validation and testing.



3. Proof of concept testing follows preclinical and software. In proof of concept we demonstrate the arm and its end-effector operation and that even someone with little robotic experience can successfully use the arm within the indications for use and for the purposes intended. A three-stage demonstration will be undertaken first on animals of various sizes and weights; then on human cadavers of various sizes and weights and finally on a small cohort of human subjects. Each stage must be successfully completed before the next stage is undertaken. The final stage (human proof of concept testing) will be under the supervision of an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or similar ethics committee.



4. The strength of our testing to date has two aims — address all aspects of risk and second to minimize the size and expense of a human clinical trial. It is our belief that any remaining element of risk or uncertainty will only require a small sample size (50 or less). Regardless of the sample size the human clinical trial shall have a performance endpoint and a safety endpoint that will serve as milestones to measure the outcome.



To support our ongoing compliance the company plans to become registered to the requirements of EN ISO 13485, the U.S.FDA QSR, ANVISA from Brazil, TGA from Australia, Health Canada, Japanese MHLW and CE Marking under new Medical Device Regulations. To achieve this with minimal expense, we plan to use a Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”) Auditing Organization that is also a European Notified Body.



Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we intend to market in the U.S. must first receive either “510(k) clearance” or “Premarket (PMA) approval” from the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to 12 months, but it can last longer. The process of obtaining PMA approval can be more costly, lengthy and uncertain. It generally takes from one to three years or even longer.



The FDA decides whether a device must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or PMA approval process based upon statutory criteria. These criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination whether the product is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to request 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies. The manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use, safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed “predicate device” that is either in class I, class II, or is a “pre-amendment” class III device, one that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification to the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval.

Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device, are placed in class III. Such devices are required to undergo the PMA approval process in which the manufacturer must prove the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction.



PMA application must provide preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with cGMP and QSR requirements, which include elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. During the FDA’s review, an FDA advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, likely will be convened to review the application and recommend to the FDA whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendation is important to the FDA’s overall decision-making process. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an “approvable letter” requiring the applicant’s agreement to comply with specific conditions or to supply specific additional data or information in order to secure final PMA approval.



Once the approvable letter conditions are satisfied, the FDA will issue a PMA order for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the manufacturer. The PMA order can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in an enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. After approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of modifications to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process.



A clinical trial may be required to support a 510(k) submission and generally is required for a PMA application. Such trials generally require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed an insignificant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. The IDE must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. Clinical trials may begin if the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites approve the IDE. Trials must be conducted in conformance with FDA regulations and institutional review board requirements.



In order for us to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with safety and quality regulations in those countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approval or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country.



To expedite securing approvals to market, we initially retained the services of HPG, a consulting firm experienced in securing U.S. and foreign approvals to market medical devices. HPG prepared and filed an application with the FDA for our initial medical robotic system and participated in the initial pre-collaboration meeting with the FDA in August 2019. This is the first of a series of meetings where the Avra system and its regulatory requirements will be discussed in ever-increasing specificity. We believe that this should allow us to closely focus on only the meaningful activities saving both resources and time. The robotic arm we will utilize for our system has already been approved in the EU and received a CE mark. The Company has begun implementing a quality and regulatory system that will serve as the foundation for U.S., Canadian, European, Australian, Japanese, and Brazilian market access for our medical robotic system. The Medical Device Single Audit Program, which we are employing, is a single inspection that, when completed, is expected to support market access to these six most important medical device marketplaces.



Our regulatory strategy has been designed so that once the first treatment is approved then following treatments, such as those using lasers, should enjoy a much quicker time to approval. Our expected timeline may change depending on available resources and FDA response times.

We plan to be registered via the MDSAP in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. FDA, Health Canada, Australian TGA, MHLW Japan, ANVISA of Brazil and the EU Medical Device Regulation, and plan to have completed integration testing for the system (controller, computer, arm, cabling, end-effector and the software) for at least two medical systems within two years of receipt of required funding.



Depending upon the terms of our agreement with the FDA on the need for and depth of proof of concept and clinical trial testing we believe that we should have completed the proof of concept and human clinical trial portion within one year of our agreement with them. We would then hold market clearances for our robotic system from the U.S. FDA, Health Canada, and CE Marking under the European Medical Directive. At around the same time, we believe that we will have made substantial progress toward market clearances in Australia, Japan and Brazil.



Manufacturing and Sources of Supply



We plan to initially assemble our systems in our own facilities and will only begin using contract manufacturers when the volume of systems being sold becomes sufficiently large to justify outsourcing. Most of the components used in our initial medical robotic system consist of existing hardware technologies relatively easily available from multiple sources. We will then make any required modifications to allow them to be assembled on site. Recent advances in such manufacturing techniques as 3D printing should allow us to do so relatively quickly. The software integration into our initial medical robotic system, calibration and testing is expected to be done on site as well. We have already identified potential manufacturers for the modified end-effectors, such as the microneedling tool, and other components we will integrate into the system.



Intellectual Property



Our proprietary software and algorithms are expected to be one of the greatest value drivers for the Company. The software and AI links all our robotic system’s various sensors, systems and tools and allows them to work seamlessly together to complete procedures autonomously given the treatment parameters provided by the operator.



To date, we have submitted six provisional patents which, upon further review internally with our IP counsel, were subsequently combined into one (1) international utility patent application. This consolidation brought together the various parts of our AIIGS. In addition, it included broad device claims involving the combination of a navigation system, sensors, a variety of end-effectors, and the robotic arm. The national stages of the international patent application were then submitted in the U.S. in July 2018 and in Brazil in December 2018. In April 2018, we also submitted a U.S. design patent application, specifically applied to the robotic arm segment housing. This design patent application was subsequently filed in Canada in October 2019.



We intend to continue filing, as necessary, patent applications in the U.S., as well as in other jurisdictions where we intend to market our products and where the dates of our initial patent applications will give us a right of priority.



We also expect to accumulate a tremendous amount of data as needed for its AI and DL systems. This should result in continuous improvements in patient outcomes. This proprietary data should not only be of value to Avra, but may also be of value to third parties in the aesthetics world.



Research Partnership with UCF



Effective as of May 2016, we entered into a Research Agreement with UCF (the “Research Agreement”) establishing a research partnership for the development of a prototype surgical robotic device supporting minimal invasive surgical facial corrections. Pursuant to the Research Agreement, UCF provided personnel for the development of prototype navigation and control software for the robotic medical device and the integration of all the necessary subcomponents. UCF engineering doctoral students under the direction of Professor of Electrical Engineering Zhihua Qu assisted Avra with its research and development efforts in autonomous medical robotics pursuant to the Research Agreement, which was extended several times and finally expired in April 2021. We provided funding of $163,307 for the project, which was supplemented by a $68,952 matching funds grant from the Florida High Tech Corridor Council. In addition, Avra paid UCF $43,548 for outright ownership of work developed by UCF in the collaboration.

Competition



The development and commercialization of medical devices is highly competitive. We will compete with a variety of multinational companies and specialized medical device companies, as well as technology being developed at universities and other research institutions.



As our technology would replace current handheld solutions, our natural competition would be existing manufacturers of those handheld devices such as Hologic’s Cynosure, Syneron Medical, and Lumenis. The current aesthetics device market is fragmented with no single company dominating the sector, particularly in the laser and micro-needling segments. Based on our research and communications with the FDA, we are not currently aware of any companies developing an autonomous robotic approach to aesthetics procedures.



As our strategy includes building a robotic platform system that would work with any handheld device, we are not tied to any particular treatment or device and could potentially partner with manufacturers of any particular end-effector technology versus competing with them. This strategy also ensures that our aesthetics solutions never become outdated as we would only need to adapt emerging end-effector instrumentation and technology to our robotic system.



Employees



As of the date of this report the Company has four full-time and six part-time employees, including certain executive officers. We also rely on independent third-party consultants to perform additional services as needed. As we implement our business plan and subject to the availability of capital, additional employees will be hired to meet the needs of our growth. We currently have agreements with several individuals, particularly in the software, artificial intelligence and engineering disciplines, who are currently working on a part-time basis, but will become full-time Avra employees upon financing.
