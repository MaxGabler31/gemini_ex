 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 Ennis, Inc. (formerly Ennis Business Forms, Inc.) (collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “Registrant,” “Ennis,” or “we,” “us,” or “our”) was organized under the laws of Texas in 1909. We and our subsidiaries print and manufacture a broad line of business forms and other business products. We distribute business products and forms throughout the United States primarily through independent distributors. This distributor channel encompasses independent print distributors, commercial printers, direct mail, fulfillment companies, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies, among others. We also sell products to many of our competitors to satisfy their customers’ needs.
Business Overview
 Our management believes we are the largest provider of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders to independent distributors in the United States.
 We are in the business of manufacturing, designing and selling business forms and other printed business products primarily to distributors located in the United States. We operate 55 manufacturing plants throughout the United States in 20 strategically located states as one reportable segment. Approximately 94% of the business products we manufacture are custom and semi-custom products, constructed in a wide variety of sizes, colors, number of parts and quantities on an individual job basis, depending upon the customers’ specifications.
 The products we sell include snap sets, continuous forms, laser cut sheets, tags, labels, envelopes, integrated products, jumbo rolls and pressure sensitive products in short, medium and long runs under the following labels: Ennis®, Royal Business Forms®, Block Graphics®, Specialized Printed Forms®, 360º Custom LabelsSM, ColorWorx®, Enfusion®, Uncompromised Check Solutions®, VersaSeal®, Ad ConceptsSM, FormSource LimitedSM, Star Award Ribbon Company®, Witt Printing®, B&D Litho®, Genforms®, PrintGraphics®, Calibrated Forms®, PrintXcel®, Printegra®, Falcon Business FormsSM, Forms ManufacturersSM, Mutual Graphics®, TRI-C Business FormsSM, Major Business SystemsSM, Independent PrintingSM, Hoosier Data Forms®, Hayes Graphics®, Wright Business GraphicsSM, Wright 360SM, Integrated Print & GraphicsSM, the Flesh CompanySM, Impressions DirectSM, Ace FormsSM, and AmeriPrintSM. We also sell the Adams McClure® brand (which provides Point of Purchase advertising for large franchise and fast food chains as well as kitting and fulfillment); the Admore®, Folder Express® and Independent Folders® brands (which provide presentation folders and document folders); Ennis Tag & LabelSM (which provides custom printed, high performance labels and custom and stock tags); Allen-Bailey Tag & LabelSM, Atlas Tag & Label®, Kay Toledo Tag®, and Special Service Partners® (SSP) (which provides custom and stock tags and labels); Trade Envelopes®, Block Graphics®, Wisco®, and National Imprint Corporation® (which provide custom and imprinted envelopes) and Northstar® and General Financial Supply® (which provide financial and security documents); InfosealSM and PrintXcel® (which provide custom and stock pressure seal documents). We sell predominantly through independent distributors, as well as to many of our competitors. Northstar Computer Forms, Inc., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, also sells direct to a small number of customers, generally large banking organizations (where a distributor is not acceptable or available to the end-user). Adams McClure, LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary, also sells direct to a small number of customers, where sales are generally through advertising agencies.
 The printing industry generally sells its products either predominantly to end users, a market dominated by a few large manufacturers, such as R.R. Donnelley and Sons, Staples, Inc., Standard Register Co. (a subsidiary of Taylor Corporation), and Cenveo, Inc., or, like the Company, through a variety of independent distributors and distributor groups. While it is not possible, because of the lack of adequate public statistical information, to determine the Company’s share of the total business products market, management believes the Company is the largest producer of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders in the United States distributing primarily through independent distributors.

There are a number of competitors that operate in this segment, ranging in size from single employee-owned operations to multi-plant organizations. We believe our strategic locations and buying power permit us to compete on a favorable basis within the distributor market on competitive factors, such as service, quality, and price.
 Distribution of business forms and other business products throughout the United States is primarily done through independent distributors, including business forms distributors, resellers, direct mail, commercial printers, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies.
 Raw materials principally consist of a wide variety of weights, widths, colors, sizes, and qualities of paper for business products purchased primarily from one major supplier at favorable prices based on the volume of business.
 Business products usage in the printing industry is generally not seasonal. General economic conditions and contraction of the traditional business forms industry are the predominant factors in quarterly volume fluctuations.
 Recent Acquisitions
 We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years.
On June 1, 2021, the Company acquired the assets and business from AmeriPrint Corporation ("AmeriPrint") in Harvard, Illinois, which prior to the acquisition generated approximately $6.5 million in sales for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, brings added capabilities and expertise to our expanding product offering including barcoding and variable imaging.
 On December 31, 2020, we acquired the assets of Infoseal LLC (“Infoseal”) in Roanoke, Virginia. The acquisition of Infoseal, which prior to the acquisition generated approximately $19.2 million in sales for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, creates additional capabilities and expertise to our product offering including our existing VersaSeal pressure seal product line.
On July 15, 2019, we acquired all the outstanding stock of The Flesh Company (“Flesh”). Flesh, together with its wholly owned subsidiary, Impressions Direct, Inc.

Wright, prior to the acquisition, generated approximately $58.0 million in sales for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 and continues to operate under its brand names.
 Patents, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
 Other than the patent for our VersaSeal® product, we do not have any significant patents, licenses, franchises, or concessions.


Intellectual Property
 We market our products under a number of trademarks and trade names. The protection of our trademarks is important to our business. We believe that our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and these trademarks are important to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products. We have registered trademarks in the United States for Ennis®, EnnisOnlineSM, B&D Litho of AZ®, B&D Litho®, ACR®, Block Graphics®, Enfusion®, 360º Custom LabelsSM, Admore®, CashManagementSupply.comSM, Securestar®, Northstar®, MICRLink®, MICR ConnectionTM, Ennisstores.comTM, General Financial Supply®, Calibrated Forms®, PrintXcel®, Printegra®, Trade Envelopes®, Witt Printing®, Genforms®, Royal Business Forms®, Crabar/GBFSM, BF&SSM, Adams McClure®, Advertising ConceptsTM, ColorWorx®, Allen-Bailey Tag & LabelSM, Atlas Tag & Label®, PrintgraphicsSM, Uncompromised Check Solutions®, VersaSeal®, VersaSeal SecureX®, Folder Express®, Wisco®, National Imprint Corporation®, Star Award Ribbon®, Kay Toledo Tag®, Falcon Business FormsSM, Forms ManufacturersSM, Mutual Graphics®, TRI-C Business FormsSM, SSP®, EOSTouchpoint®, Printersmall®, Check Guard®, Envirofolder®, Independent®, Independent Checks®, Independent Folders®, Independent Large Format Solutions®, Wright Business GraphicsSM, Wright 360SM, Integrated Print & GraphicsSM, the Flesh CompanySM, Impressions DirectSM, Ace FormsSM, MegaformSM, Safe®, InfosealSM, and variations of these brands as well as other trademarks. We have similar trademark registrations internationally for certain trademarks.
Customers
 No single customer accounts for as much as five percent of our consolidated net sales or accounts receivable.
 Backlog
 At February 28, 2022, our backlog of firm orders was approximately $38.4 million, compared to approximately $23.6 million at February 28, 2021.
Research and Development
 While we seek new products to sell through our distribution channel, there have been no material amounts spent on research and development in fiscal years 2022, 2021 or 2020.
Environment
 We are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, air emissions and solid waste disposal. Our manufacturing processes do not emit substantial foreign substances into the environment. We do not believe that our compliance with federal, state, or local statutes or regulations relating to the protection of the environment has any material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that future changes in federal, state, or local regulations, interpretations of existing regulations or the discovery of currently unknown problems or conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures. Similarly, the extent of our liability, if any, for past failures to comply with laws, regulations, and permits applicable to our operations cannot be determined.
Environmental Stewardship
 Ennis respects the environment and makes all attempts to protect our natural resources. We believe we comply with all laws and regulations regarding the use and preservation of our land, air, and water. This principle has been part of our Code of Conduct since 2005. Our goal of operating in an environmentally responsible manner aligns with our goals of operating a profitable and responsible business. For example, we recycle waste material generated in our printing processes to generate income from selling the scrap material. We recycled 26.7 million pounds of paper and 1.4 million pounds of cardboard and cores in 2022. Additionally, the use of soy based inks allows us to avoid more harmful cleaning solutions which are environmentally dangerous. We use those soy based inks in approximately 80% of our products. We use environmentally friendly cleaning agents to insure that our waste water is not contaminated and does not require special disposal.
 Many of our plants engage with local energy suppliers to ask for recommendations on lowering energy usage. Participation in these energy audits generally results in replacing old lighting with more efficient LED lighting. Additionally, newer digital technology, which we have implemented in several of our locations, relies on less energy than older web-based presses due to shorter runs and ink jet technology.


Another aspect of our business model which reduces carbon emissions is the reduction in transportation costs for our employees, as well as our customers. Approximately 80% of our facilities are located in small towns where the employees are less than 10 miles from the plant, and travel time is minimal. Our geographical dispersion reduces the amount of transportation time and distance associated with delivering our products to our customers. Likewise we use third party transportation and logistical companies to pick up and deliver our products. Partnering with larger shipping organizations that have the scale to be more resourceful and implement more energy efficient delivery methods enables us to ship our products in an efficient and effective manner.
 Our primary supplier of paper is vital to our business as they supply raw materials that are minimally altered during the production process. Our primary supplier is SFI, FSC and PEFC certified. The SFI Forest Management Standard covers key values such as protection of biodiversity, species at risk and wildlife habitat; sustainable harvest levels; protection of water quality; and prompt regeneration. FSC certification ensures that products come from responsibly-managed forests that provide environmental, social and economic benefits. PEFC cares for forests globally and locally. They work to protect our forests by promoting sustainable forest management through certification. This means that all can benefit from the many products that forests provide now, while ensuring these forests will be around for generations to come. The Company’s primary paper supplier ensures that all of their supply chain materials are sourced with similar accredited suppliers allowing for more transparency and a more trustworthy supplier commitment to quality, safety and the protection of our natural resources.
Additionally, we use material safety sheets which outline potential hazardous materials so as to minimize the use of more hazardous materials. Given the low and de minimus use of these potentially hazardous materials, our plants generally fit in the lowest category of reporting standards to various state and local environmental agencies. The Company requires facility managers to minimize the use or site storage of any hazardous chemicals. Two thirds of our facilities are categorized as Very Small Quantity Generators and one third are considered Small Quantity Generators under the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) hazardous waste regulations. Any hazardous waste generated is stored and properly disposed of in compliance with all EPA regulations and permits.
Two of our largest facilities have solvent recovery systems which allows recovery of press plate washing solutions for re-use. These systems result in a substantial reduction of any hazardous waste. The Company ensures that we are in compliance with applicable state and federal environmental laws on hazardous materials including Proposition 65 in California and federal Conflict Materials compliance.
Attention to choice of material suppliers, transportation partners, energy usage and avoidance of hazardous wastes that might impact waste water disposal, are part of the business model that improves or avoids damage to the environment we live and work in.
Employees
 At February 28, 2022, we had 1,997 employees. 170 employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic negotiations. We believe we have a good working relationship with all of the unions that represent our employees.
Social Responsibility
 Equal Employment Opportunity: Ennis promotes a cooperative and productive work environment by supporting the cultural and ethnic diversity of its workforce and is committed to providing equal employment opportunity to all qualified employees and applicants. Pursuant to our Code of Conduct adopted in 2005 and reviewed at least annually, we do not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, marital status, age, disability, or veteran status in any personnel practice, including recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, and discipline. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and we comply with all employment laws including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Immigration and Nationality Act, and the IRCA. We take allegations of harassment and unlawful discrimination seriously and address all such concerns that are raised regarding our Code of Conduct.
 Safety and Health: A safe and clean work environment is important to the well-being of all Ennis employees. Ennis complies with applicable safety and health regulations and appropriate practices. Throughout the year facilities are reviewed monthly to determine if the accidents/injuries that occurred could have been avoided. Incidents are reviewed to determine measures that can be taken to prevent reoccurrence of claims at that facility or another facility. A monthly Facility Report is sent to all facilities reminding them about safety issues and certain claims that have occurred in other locations. Annually, facilities are required to submit an audit of compliance

with mandated OSHA safety programs. Facilities that have higher than normal claims are worked with directly or visited by a business director or a representative from our workers’ compensation carrier. Protocols and trainings are in place to protect the health and safety of all our employees. Safety audits are completed throughout the organization. The Company strictly monitors safety issues in all of our facilities, and each facility has someone in charge of review and training of employees on safety issues. Consistent with our culture of promoting workplace safety, our plants take pride in detailing the amount of time since the last safety incident and strive to maintain the lack of an occurrence.
Ennis is dedicated to ensuring that any business is conducted as ethically as possible. All Ennis management must read, agree with, and sign a Code of Conduct and Ethics policy at least annually.
 Each of our locations support local non-profit organizations, educational institutions and youth sport teams based on their local community needs. The majority of our locations are located in suburban or rural communities where the plant is a major employer and supporter of the local economy. Some examples include Midlothian Educational Foundation (Ennis is a founding member), Project Graduation, Toys for Tots, Angel Trees, United Way fundraisers, and youth sport team sponsorships. Additional support includes in-kind donations, volunteer hours and financial support for various local organizations.
