Item 1.    Business
General:
Regis Corporation owns, franchises and operates beauty salons. The Company is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "RGS." Unless the context otherwise provides, when we refer to the "Company," "we," "our," or "us," we are referring to Regis Corporation, the Registrant, together with its subsidiaries.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company-owned, franchised or held ownership interests in 8,168 locations worldwide. The Company's locations consist of 3,966 company-owned salons, 4,114 franchised salons and 88 locations in which we maintain a non-controlling ownership interest of less than 100%. Each of the Company's salon concepts generally offer similar salon products and services.
The major services supplied by the Company's salons are haircutting and styling (including shampooing and conditioning), hair coloring and other services. Service revenues comprise approximately 81% of total company-owned revenues. The percentage of company-owned service revenues in fiscal year 2018 attributable to haircutting and styling, hair coloring and other services were 77%, 16% and 7%, respectively. 
In fiscal year 2017, we announced plans to expand the franchise side of our business, through organic growth and by selling certain company-owned salons to franchisees over time, as well as our review of strategic alternatives for company-owned mall-based locations. In January 2017, we began franchising the SmartStyle brand throughout the U.S. for the first time. In fiscal year 2018, the Company began to consider additional options to further expand its franchise business within its Supercuts company-owned salon portfolio.
In October 2017, the Company sold substantially all of its mall-based salon business in North America, representing 858 salons, and substantially all of its previous International segment, representing 250 salons in the UK, to The Beautiful Group ("TBG"), an affiliate of Regent, a private equity firm based in Los Angeles, California, who operates these locations as franchise locations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K for further discussion on the sale of our mall-based salon business and the previous International segment, which are now reported as a discontinued operation. As a result of this transaction, the Company redefined its operating segments to reflect how the chief operating decision maker now evaluates the business. The Company now reports its operations in two operating segments: Company-owned salons and Franchise salons. Prior to this change, the Company had four operating segments: North American Value, North American Premium, North American Franchise and International. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. 
In January 2018, the Company closed 597 non-performing company-owned SmartStyle salons. The 597 non-performing salons generated negative cash flow of approximately $15 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. The Company anticipates this action will allow the Company to reallocate capital and human resources to strategically grow its remaining SmartStyle salons with creative new offerings. 
The Company's Company-owned salon operations are comprised of 3,966 company-owned salons operating in the United States (U.S.), Canada, and Puerto Rico. The Company's Franchise salon operations are comprised of 4,114 franchised salons operating in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. The Company's salons operate primarily under the trade names of SmartStyle, Supercuts, MasterCuts, Regis Salons, and Cost Cutters, and they generally serve two categories within the industry, value and premium. SmartStyle, Supercuts, MasterCuts, Cost Cutters, and other regional trade names are generally within the value category, offering high quality, convenience, and affordably priced hair care and beauty services and retail products. Regis Salons, among other trade names, are in the premium category, offering upscale hair care and beauty services and retail products. The Company's Company-owned business is primarily located mainly in strip center locations and Walmart Supercenters. The Company's Franchise business is primarily located in strip center locations, Walmart Supercenters and mall-based locations. During fiscal years 2018 and 2017, the number of guest visits at the Company's company-owned salons approximated 50 and 57 million, respectively. 
Financial information about our segments and geographic areas for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 are included in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.
As we continue to evaluate our business and our mix of company-owned and franchise locations, future sales of company-owned salons to franchisees could impact our operations by decreasing total revenues and operating expenses.

Industry Overview:
The hair salon market is highly fragmented, with the vast majority of locations independently owned and operated. However, the influence of salon chains, both franchised and company-owned, continues to grow within this market. Management believes salon chains will continue to have significant influence on this market and will continue to increase their presence.
In every area in which the Company has a salon, there are competitors offering similar hair care services and products at similar prices. The Company faces competition from chains, such as Great Clips, Fantastic Sams, Sport Clips and Ulta Beauty, independently owned salons, department store salons located within malls, in-home hair services, booth rentals and blow dry bars.
At the individual salon level, barriers to entry are low; however, barriers exist for chains to expand nationally due to the need to establish systems and infrastructure, to recruit franchisees, experienced field and salon management and stylists, and to lease quality sites. The principal factors of competition in the hair care category are quality and consistency of the guest experience, convenience, location and price. The Company continually strives to improve its performance in each of these areas and to create additional points of brand differentiation versus the competition.
2018 Strategy:
The Company is focused on maximizing shareholder value. In order to successfully maximize shareholder value we place a balanced approach to our guests, employees and stylists, franchisees and shareholders. Our multi-year renewal strategy and key priorities are focused on loving our guests and stylists and initiatives to enhance shareholder value. Achieving our strategy requires a disciplined and thoughtful approach to investing and disinvesting in programming. We are focused on accelerating the growth of our franchise business, where we believe it enhances shareholder value, while materially improving the performance of our company-owned salons.

In fiscal year 2018, the Company has executed on various management initiatives to help stabilize performance and establish a platform for longer term revenue and earnings growth in company-owned salons and expanding its franchise business in order to maximize shareholder value. The core components of the various management initiatives are focused on improving upon our performance by better aligning company resources to demand while continuing to provide an exceptional guest experience, simplification of our business to grow revenues and disinvestment of certain programs that do not create value. As part of the various management initiatives, the Company has appointed several new key executives and personnel, including President of Franchise (in fiscal year 2017), Chief Financial Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, General Counsel, Chief Technology Officer, Senior Vice President, Merchandising and Vice President Creative. 
In order to continue providing an exceptional guest experience, we have invested in salon technology by launching SmartStyle online same-day check-in, which allows our guests in Walmart locations to find a location near them, view wait times, check-in via our website or mobile application and upgrading our point-of-sale (POS) hardware to facilitate an efficient guest experience within the salons and deploying tablets in corporate-owned salons to open a channel of direct communication with our stylists, including technical education. 
To maximize shareholder value, we are focused on simplification, variable labor management, quality revenue growth, and the allocation of our capital to value-maximizing initiatives. Our business historically has been structured geographically. To simplify and better focus our business on our guests, effective August 1, 2017, we re-aligned the existing field leadership team into three distinct field organizations based on our core brands: SmartStyle, Supercuts and Signature Style. This enables our field leaders to focus on specific brands. We continue to focus on managing variable stylist staffing in our corporate salons to improve financial results and in certain markets may execute price increases in our company-owned salons. 
We continue to evaluate our investments and disinvest in non-value generating programs while investing in other value generating initiatives. In January 2018, we closed 597 non-performing company-owned SmartStyle salons. The 597 non-performing salons generated negative cash flow of approximately $15 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. This action will allow us to reallocate capital and human resources to strategically grow our remaining SmartStyle salons with creative new offerings. In addition, we repurposed certain corporate programs and have invested in our creative digital capabilities to re-position Regis as the leading operator of value brands and technical education. Furthermore, we have launched a national SmartStyle digital advertising campaign to drive traffic to our SmartStyle locations in Walmart Supercenters and leverage our relationship with Walmart. We will continue this evaluation as we make decisions in the business.
At the same time, we are making thoughtful decisions to accelerate the growth of our franchise business, if we believe it enhances shareholder value, including the promotion of Eric Bakken to President of our Franchise business. This strategic initiative is intended to facilitate an ongoing multi-year transformation of our operating platform that balances our commitment to high-performing company-owned salons while enabling strategic optionality and the ongoing growth of our franchise business, where we believe it enhances shareholder value. In October 2017, we sold substantially all of our mall-based salon business in North America, representing 858 salons, and substantially all of our previous International segment, representing 250 salons in the UK, to TBG, who operates these locations as franchise locations.
Guests
Among other factors, consistent delivery of an exceptional guest experience, haircut quality, convenience, competitive pricing, salon location, inviting salon appearance and atmosphere, differentiating benefits and guest experience elements and comprehensive retail assortments, all drive guest traffic and improve guest retention.
Guest Experience. Our portfolio of salon concepts enable our guests to select different service scheduling options based upon their preference. We believe that in the value category, the ability to serve walk-in appointments and minimize guest wait times is an essential element in delivering an efficient guest experience. Our mobile applications and online check-in capabilities allow us to capitalize on our guests' desire for convenience. We continue to focus on stylist staffing and retention, optimizing schedules and leveraging our POS systems to help us balance variable labor hours with guest traffic and manage guest wait times. In the Premium category, our salons generally schedule appointments in advance of service. Our salons are located in high-traffic strip centers, Walmart Supercenters and shopping malls, with guest parking and easy access, and are generally open seven days per week, offering guests a variety of convenient ways to fulfill their beauty needs. 
Affordability. The Company strives to offer an exceptional value for its services. In the value category, our guests expect outstanding service at competitive prices. These expectations are met with average service transactions ranging from $19 to $21. During fiscal year 2018, we greatly reduced the complexity of the service offerings within our SmartStyle portfolio with the introduction of "Everyday Simple Pricing" while also introducing a new "Express Haircut" service targeted towards the 
6

male guests who shop at Walmart and simplified the service offerings within our Signature Style portfolio. Pricing decisions are considered on a salon level basis and established based on local conditions.
Salon Appearance and Atmosphere. The Company's salons range from 500 to 5,000 square feet, with the typical salon approximating 1,200 square feet. Our salon repairs and maintenance program is designed to ensure we invest in salon cleanliness and safety, as well as in maintaining the normal operation of our salons. Our annual capital expenditures include funds to refresh the appeal and comfort of our salons. 
Retail Assortments. The Company's salons sell nationally recognized hair care and beauty products, as well as a complete assortment of owned brand products. The Company's stylists are compensated and regularly trained to sell hair care and beauty products to their guests. Additionally, guests are encouraged to purchase products after stylists demonstrate their efficacy by using them in the styling of our guests' hair. The top selling brands within the Company's retail assortment include Regis DESIGNLINE, Paul Mitchell, Biolage, Redken, Sexy Hair Concepts, Nioxin, Kenra, It's a 10, Total Results, and Tigi. We also continued to expand our e-commerce initiative to distribute our Regis DESIGNLINE brand through new distribution channels to supplement our existing in-salon sales and raise brand awareness. 
Technology. Our point of sale (POS) systems have the ability to collect guest and transactional data and enable the Company to invest in guest relationship management, gaining insights into guest behavior, communicating with guests and incenting return visits. Leveraging this technology allows us to monitor guest retention and to survey our guests for feedback on improving the guest experience. Our mobile applications allow guests to view wait times and interact in other ways with salons. We are currently making further investments to improve the speed of our POS technology, improving the overall guest experience.
Marketing. We are investing in advertising to drive traffic. This includes leveraging advertising and media, guest relationship management programs, digital programs, one-on-one communications and local tactical efforts (e.g., couponing), among other programs. Traffic driving efforts are targeted vs. a one-size-fits-all approach. Annual advertising and promotional plans are based on seasonality, consumer mindset, competitive positioning and return on investment. In fiscal year 2018, we entered into an industry-exclusive, multi-year sponsorship between Supercuts and Major League Baseball and select local club partnerships. We continually reallocate marketing investments into opportunities we believe represent the highest return to our shareholders.
Stylists
Our organization depends on its stylists to help deliver great guest experiences.
Field Leadership. As of August 1, 2017, we reorganized our field leadership by brand. This change will simplify and better focus our business by re-aligning the existing field leaders into three distinct field organizations: SmartStyle, Supercuts and Signature Style. Previously, these field leaders were responsible for a variety of brands, with different business models, services, pay plans and guest expectations. Post-reorganization, each field leader is dedicated to a specific brand. We believe the new structure will further enable our field leadership to focus on quality guest experiences, enable improved salon execution, drive same-store sales traffic growth and simplify our operations. 
Development of our field leaders is a high priority because stylists depend on their salons and field leaders for coaching, mentoring and motivation. Our training curriculum serves as the foundation for ongoing leadership development. Role clarity and talent assessments help us identify ways to develop and upgrade field leadership. Execution disciplines are used to drive accountability, execution and business performance. Incentives are designed to align field interests with those of the Company's shareholders by rewarding behaviors focused on revenue and EBITDA growth. This organization structure also provides a clear career path for our people who desire to ascend within the Company.
Technical Education. We place a tremendous amount of importance in ongoing development of our stylists' craft. We intend to be the industry leader in technical training, including the utilization of digital training. Our stylists deliver a superior experience for our guests when they are well trained technically and experientially. We employ technical trainers who provide new hire training for stylists joining the Company from beauty schools and training for all stylists in current beauty care and styling trends. We supplement internal training with targeted vendor training and external trainers who bring specialized expertise to our stylists. We utilize training materials to help all levels of field employees navigate the running of a salon and essential elements of guest service training within the context of brand positions.
 Recruiting.     Ensuring that we attract, train and retain our stylists is critical to our success. We compete with all service industries for our stylists; to that end, we continue to enhance our recruiting efforts across all levels within our organization and are focused on showing our stylists a path forward. We cultivate a pipeline of field leaders through succession planning and recruitment venues from within and outside the salon industry. We also leverage beauty school relationships and participate in job fairs and industry events.

Technology. Our POS systems and salon workstations throughout North America enable communication with salons and stylists, delivery of online and digital training to stylists, salon level analytics on guest retention, wait times, stylist productivity, and salon performance. We are currently making further investments in our POS hardware and salon technology to improve the speed of our systems allowing for stylists to be more productive and improve overall guest and stylist satisfaction. We are also deploying tablets to salons to enhance the channel of communication with our stylists and enable digital training. 
Salon Support
Our corporate headquarters is referred to as Salon Support. This acknowledges that loving our guests and stylists mandates a service-oriented, guest and stylist-focused mentality in supporting our field organization.
Organization. Salon Support and our associated priorities are aligned to our field organization to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the service we provide and optimize the guest experience. 
Simplification. Our ongoing simplification efforts focus on improving the way we plan and execute across our portfolio of brands. Every program, communication, and report that complicates our operations and takes time away from our guests is being assessed for simplification or elimination. Simplifying processes and procedures around scheduling, inventory management, day-to-day salon execution, communication and reporting improve salon service. Our organization also remains focused on eliminating non-essential costs and on profit enhancing initiatives that do not harm the guest experience.

Salon Franchising Program:
General.    We have various franchising programs supporting our 4,114 franchised salons as of June 30, 2018, consisting mainly of Supercuts, SmartStyle, Cost Cutters, Regis salons, MasterCuts, First Choice Haircutters, Roosters, Magicuts salons. These salons have been included in the discussions regarding salon counts and concepts.
We provide our franchisees with a comprehensive system of business training, stylist education, site approval and lease negotiation, construction management services, professional marketing, promotion, and advertising programs, and other forms of on-going support designed to help franchisees build successful businesses.
Standards of Operations.    The Company does not control the day-to-day operations of its franchisees, including employment, benefits and wage determination, establishing prices to charge for products and services, business hours, personnel management, and capital expenditure decisions. However, the franchise agreements afford certain rights to the Company, such as the right to approve locations, suppliers and the sale of a franchise. Additionally, franchisees are required to conform to the Company's established operational policies and procedures relating to quality of service, training, salon design and decor, and trademark usage. The Company's field personnel make periodic visits to franchised salons to ensure they are operating in conformity with the standards for each franchising program. All of the rights afforded to the Company with regard to franchised operations allow the Company to protect its brands, but do not allow the Company to control the franchise operations or make decisions that have a significant impact on the success of the franchised salons. The Company’s franchise agreements do not give the Company any right, ability or potential to determine or otherwise influence any terms and/or conditions of employment of franchisees’ employees (except for those, if any, that are specifically related to quality of service, training, salon design, decor, and trademark usage), including, but not limited to, franchisees’ employees’ wages and benefits, hours of work, scheduling, leave programs, seniority rights, promotional or transfer opportunities, layoff/recall arrangements, grievance and dispute resolution procedures, dress code, and/or discipline and discharge. 
Franchise Terms.    Pursuant to a franchise agreement with the Company, each franchisee pays an initial fee for each store and ongoing royalties to the Company. In addition, for most franchise concepts, the Company collects advertising funds from franchisees and administers the funds on behalf of the concepts. Franchisees are responsible for the costs of leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, equipment, supplies, inventory, payroll costs and certain other items, including initial working capital. The majority of franchise agreements provide the Company a right of first refusal if the store is to be sold and the franchisee must obtain the Company's approval in all instances where there is a sale of a franchise location.
Additional information regarding each of the major franchised brands is listed below:
Supercuts
Supercuts franchise agreements have a perpetual term, subject to termination of the underlying lease agreement or termination of the franchise agreement by either the Company or the franchisee. All new franchisees enter into development agreements, which give them the right to enter into a defined number of franchise agreements. These franchise agreements are site specific. The development agreement provides limited territorial protection for the stores developed under those franchise agreements. Older franchisees have grandfathered expansion rights which allow them to develop stores outside of development agreements and provide them with greater territorial protections in their markets. The Company has a comprehensive impact policy that resolves potential conflicts among Supercuts franchisees and/or the Company's Supercuts locations regarding proposed store sites.
SmartStyle and Cost Cutters in Walmart Supercenters 
The majority of existing SmartStyle and Cost Cutters franchise agreements for salons located in Walmart Supercenters have a five year term with a five year option to renew. The franchise agreements are site specific. As announced in January 2017, this business grew primarily through conversions from corporate to franchise-owned salons.
11

Cost Cutters (not located in Walmart Supercenters), First Choice Haircutters and Magicuts
The majority of existing Cost Cutters franchise agreements have a 15 year term with a 15 year option to renew (at the option of the franchisee), while the majority of First Choice Haircutters franchise agreements have a ten year term with a five year option to renew.

Salon Markets and Marketing:
Company-Owned Salons
The Company utilizes various marketing vehicles for its salons, including traditional advertising, guest relationship management, digital marketing programs and promotional/pricing based programs. Most marketing vehicles including radio, print, online, digital and television advertising are developed and supervised at the Company's Salon Support headquarters. The Company reviews its brand strategy with the intent to create more clear communication platforms, identities and differentiation points for our brands to drive consumer preference.
Franchised Salons
Most franchise concepts maintain separate advertising funds that provide comprehensive marketing and sales support for each system. The Supercuts advertising fund is the Company's largest advertising fund and is administered by a council consisting of primarily franchisee representatives. The council has overall control of the advertising fund's expenditures and operates in accordance with terms of the franchise operating and other agreements. All stores, company-owned and franchised, contribute to the advertising funds. Depending on the brand, the funds are allocated to the brand contributing market for media placement and local marketing activities or to the creation of national advertising and system-wide activities.

Governmental Regulations:
The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and provincial laws affecting its business as well as a variety of regulatory provisions relating to the conduct of its beauty related business, including health and safety.
In the United States, the Company's franchise operations are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising (the FTC Rule) and by state laws and administrative regulations that regulate various aspects of franchise operations and sales. The Company's franchises are offered to franchisees by means of an offering circular/disclosure document containing specified disclosures in accordance with the FTC Rule and the laws and regulations of certain states. The Company has registered its offering of franchises with the regulatory authorities of those states in which it offers franchises and in which such registration is required. State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and, in certain cases, apply substantive standards to this relationship. Such laws may, for example, require that the franchisor deal with the franchisee in good faith, may prohibit interference with the right of free association among franchisees and may limit termination of franchisees without payment of reasonable compensation. The Company believes that the current trend is for government regulation of franchising to increase over time. However, such laws have not had, and the Company does not expect such laws to have, a significant effect on the Company's operations.
In Canada, the Company's franchise operations are subject to franchise laws and regulations in the provinces of Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. The offering of franchises in Canada occurs by way of a disclosure document, which contains certain disclosures required by the applicable provincial laws. The provincial franchise laws and regulations primarily focus on disclosure requirements, although each requires certain relationship requirements such as a duty of fair dealing and the right of franchisees to associate and organize with other franchisees.
The Company believes it is operating in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing all of its operations.
The Company maintains an ownership interest in EEG. Beauty schools derive a significant portion of their revenue from student financial assistance originating from the U.S. Department of Education's Title IV Higher Education Act of 1965. For the students to receive financial assistance at the school, the beauty schools must maintain eligibility requirements established by the U.S. Department of Education.
