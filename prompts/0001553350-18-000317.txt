ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 We are a leading independent entertainment marketing and premium content development company. Through our recent acquisition of 42West, LLC (42West) in March 2017, we provide expert strategic marketing and publicity services to all of the major film studios, and many of the leading independent and digital content providers, as well as for hundreds of A-list celebrity talent, including actors, directors, producers, recording artists, athletes and authors. The strategic acquisition of 42West brings together premium marketing services with premium content production, creating significant opportunities to serve our respective constituents more strategically and to grow and diversify our business. Our content production business is a long established, leading independent producer, committed to distributing premium, best-in-class film and digital entertainment. We produce original feature films and digital programming primarily aimed at family and young adult markets.
 We were first incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 7, 1995 and domesticated in the State of Florida on December 4, 2014. Our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on December 21, 2017 under the symbol DLPN.
 The principal sellers of 42West each entered into employment agreements with our company for a three-year term. The non-executive employees of 42West have also been retained. 
 As a result of the 42West acquisition, we operate in two reportable segments: our entertainment publicity segment and our content production segment. The entertainment publicity division comprises 42West and provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, entertainment content marketing and strategic marketing consulting. The content production division comprises Dolphin Films Inc. (Dolphin Films) and Dolphin Digital Studios and specializes in the production and distribution of digital content and feature films.
 Effective July 6, 2017, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to (i) change our name from Dolphin Digital Media, Inc. to Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.; (ii) cancel previous designations of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; (iii) reduce the number of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (described below) outstanding in light of our 1-for-20 reverse stock split from 1,000,000 to 50,000 shares; and (iv) clarify the voting rights of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock that, except as required by law, holders of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will only have voting rights once the independent directors of the board of directors determine that an optional conversion threshold has occurred. Effective September 14, 2017, we amended our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to effectuate a 1-for-2 reverse stock split.
 Growth Opportunities
 We are focused on driving growth through the following:
 Expand and grow 42West to serve more clients with a broad array of interrelated services. As a result of its acquisition by Dolphin, 42West now has the ability to create promotional and marketing content for clients, a critical service for celebrities and marketers alike in todays digital world. We believe that by adding content creation to 42Wests capabilities, we can capitalize on unique synergies to drive organic growth, which we expect will allow us to both attract new clients and broaden our offering of billable services to existing ones. We also believe that the skills and experience of our 42West business in entertainment PR are readily transferable to related business sectors, such as sports and fashion. The growing involvement in non-entertainment businesses by many of our existing entertainment clients has allowed 42West to establish a presence and develop expertise outside its traditional footprint. Using this as a foundation, we are now working to expand our involvement in these new areas.
 We also expect to continue to grow 42West’s current business divisions. For example:
 ·
 In the Entertainment and Targeted Marketing division, several of our large key clients have announced increased movie marketing budgets over the next several years that we expect will drive growth of our revenue and profits;
 
1


·
 In the Talent division, we expect to continue to drive significant growth through the hiring of additional individuals or teams whose existing books of business and talent rosters can be accretive to revenues and profits of the business. 42West experienced approximately 14% revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in the number of new clients. We expect that new hires, such as the new managing director hired in July 2017, who was previously a 12-year public relations veteran of The Walt Disney Studios, will contribute to this continued growth of new clients and, therefore, increases in revenue; and

·
 In the Strategic Communications division, we believe that growth will be driven by increasing demand for these services by traditional and non-traditional media clients over the next three to five years as they expand their activities in the content production, branding, and consumer products sectors. We believe that this growth could result in the Strategic Communications division significantly increasing its contribution to revenue and profit, as this division typically generates higher profit margins than the other 42West divisions.
 Organically grow through future synergies between 42West and our digital and film productions. We believe that adding content creation to 42Wests capabilities provides a great opportunity for growth, as we expect it to allow us to both attract new clients and broaden our offering of billable services to existing ones. Furthermore, bringing marketing expertise in-house will allow us to review a prospective digital or film projects marketing potential prior to making a production commitment, thus allowing our marketing strategy to be a driver of our creative content. In addition, for each project greenlit for production, we can potentially create a comprehensive marketing plan before the start of principal photography, allowing for relevant marketing assets to be created while filming. We can also create marketing campaigns for completed films, across all media channels, including television, print, radio, digital and social media.
 Opportunistically grow through complementary acquisitions. We plan to selectively pursue acquisitions in the future to further enforce our competitive advantages and scale and to grow our business and increase profitability. Our acquisition strategy is based on identifying and acquiring companies that complement our existing content production and entertainment publicity services businesses. We believe that complementary businesses, such as data analytics and digital marketing, can create synergistic opportunities and bolster profits and cash flow. We intend to complete at least one acquisition during the next year, although there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so.
 Build a portfolio of premium film, television and digital content. We intend to grow and diversify our portfolio of film and digital content by capitalizing on demand for high quality digital media and film content throughout the world marketplace. We plan to balance our financial risks against the probability of commercial success for each project. We believe that our strategic focus on content and creation of innovative content distribution strategies will enhance our competitive position in the industry, ensure optimal use of our capital, build a diversified foundation for future growth and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Finally, we believe that marketing strategies that will be developed by 42West will drive our creative content, thus creating greater potential for profitability.
 Entertainment Publicity
 42West
 Through 42West, an entertainment public relations agency, we offer talent, entertainment and targeted marketing and strategic communications services. In addition, we provide brand marketing and digital marketing services. Prior to its acquisition, 42West grew to become one of the largest independently-owned public relations firms in the entertainment industry. Among other benefits, we believe that the 42West acquisition will strengthen and complement our current content production business, while expanding and diversifying our operations. We believe that having marketing expertise in-house will allow us to review a prospective projects marketing potential prior to making a production commitment. Furthermore, for each project greenlit for production, we can potentially create a comprehensive marketing plan before the start of principal photography, allowing for relevant marketing assets to be created while filming. Therefore, we believe the marketing of our projects can begin much sooner than the delivery of a finished film or series.
 Our public relations and marketing professionals at 42West develop and execute marketing and publicity strategies for hundreds of movies and television shows as well as for individual actors, filmmakers, recording artists, and authors. Through 42West, we provide services in the following areas:

Talent
 We focus on creating and implementing strategic communication campaigns for performers and entertainers, including television and film stars, recording artists, authors, models, athletes, and theater actors. Our talent roster includes Oscar- and Emmy-winning actors and Grammy-winning singers and musicians and New York Times best-selling authors. Our services in this area include ongoing strategic counsel, media relations, studio, network, charity, corporate liaison and event and tour support.
Entertainment and Targeted Marketing
 We provide marketing direction, public relations counsel and media strategy for productions (including theatrical films, DVD and VOD releases, television programs, and online series) as well as content producers, ranging from individual filmmakers and creative artists to production companies, film financiers, DVD distributors, and other entities. Our capabilities include worldwide studio releases, independent films, television programming and web productions. We provide entertainment marketing services in connection with film festivals, awards campaigns, event publicity and red carpet management. In addition, we provide targeted marketing and publicity services that are tailored to reach diverse audiences. Our clients include major studios and independent producers for whom we create strategic multicultural marketing campaigns and provide strategic guidance aimed at reaching diverse audiences.
Strategic Communications
 Our strategic communications team advises high-profile individuals and companies faced with sensitive situations or looking to raise, reposition, or rehabilitate their public profiles. We also help studios and filmmakers deal with controversial movies.
 Much of the activities of our strategic communications team involves orchestrating high-stakes communications campaigns in response to sensitive, complex situations where clients seek to rehabilitate their public profiles. We also help companies define objectives, develop messaging, create brand identities, and construct long-term strategies to achieve specific goals, as well as manage functions such as media relations or internal communications on a day-to-day basis. The strategic communications team focuses on strategic communications counsel, corporate positioning, brand enhancement, media relations, reputation and issues management, litigation support and crisis management and communications. Our clients include major studios and production companies, record labels, sports franchises, media conglomerates, technology companies, philanthropic organizations, talent guilds, and trade associations, as well as a wide variety of high-profile individuals, ranging from major movie and pop stars to top executives and entrepreneurs.
 Content Production
 Dolphin Digital Studios
 Through Dolphin Digital Studios, we create original content to premiere online, in the form of web series. Dolphin Digital Studios is instrumental in producing and distributing our web series and sourcing financing for our digital media projects. Premium online and mobile video is the largest growth sector for online and mobile advertising, with market leaders such as YouTube, Facebook, Verizon and AT&T investing in major initiatives around original programming.
 We target three distinct demographics for our web series activities:
 ·
 Tweens (roughly 9-14 years old);
 ·
 Teens and young adults (roughly 14-24 years old); and
 ·
 General market (roughly 14-49 years old).
 We expect to serve each of these demographics with different content, and we may have different distribution partners for each demographic.
 Dolphin Films
 Dolphin Films is a content producer of motion pictures. We also own the rights to several scripts that we intend to produce at a future date.

Digital and Film Production
 Our in-house development team is continuously reviewing scripts for digital projects that are directed at one of our target demographics and that we believe we can produce within our normal planned budget range of $3.0 to $5.0 million. Our budget typically includes costs associated with purchase of the script, production of the project and marketing of the project. Occasionally, we hire writers to develop a script for an idea that we have internally. From the selection provided by our development team, our management reviews the scripts and evaluates them based on expected appeal to advertisers, available talent, budget for the production and available financing. We normally purchase a variety of scripts that we hold for future use. Not all scripts purchased will be produced. Some scripts revert back to the writer if they are not produced during a contractually agreed upon timeframe.
 Once we have a stable of scripts, we present a variety of projects, based on these scripts, to online platforms such as Hulu, AOL, and Yahoo!. The online platform will typically evaluate the project based on its estimate of potential demand, considering the genre or demographic to which they are looking to appeal. Once an online platform selects a project, we enter into a distribution agreement with the online platform that outlines, among other things, our revenue share percentages (typically between 30% and 45%) and the length of time that the show will air on that online platform. Based on agreements with the online platforms and advertisers, our management then makes the decision to greenlight or to approve, a project for production.
 Our goal is also to produce young adult and family films, and our in-house development team reviews scripts for motion pictures in this genre that can be produced within a budget range of $6.0 to $9.0 million. Our budget includes the cost of acquiring the script and producing the motion picture. We finance our motion pictures with funds from investors and the financing from international licensing agreements for the motion picture.
 The production of digital projects and motion pictures is very similar. Once management greenlights a project, the pre-production phase, including the hiring of a director, talent, various crew and securing locations to film, begins. We may become signatories to certain guilds such as Screen Actors Guild, Directors Guild of America and Writers Guild of America in order to allow us to hire directors and talent for our productions. We typically hire crew members directly, engage a production service company to provide us with, among other things, the crew, equipment and a production office or use a combination of the two alternatives. Directors and talent are typically compensated a base amount for their work. In addition, directors and talent who are members of various guilds may receive remuneration from residuals that we pay to the various guilds based on the performance of our productions in ancillary markets. To better manage our upfront production costs, we sometimes structure our agreements with talent to allow them to participate in the proceeds of the digital project or motion picture in exchange for reduced upfront fixed payments, regardless of the projects success.
 The decision of where to produce the project is often based on incentive tax programs implemented by many states and foreign countries to attract film production in their jurisdictions as a means of economic development. These incentives normally take the form of sales tax refunds, transferable tax credits, refundable tax credits or cash rebates that are calculated based on a percentage spent in the jurisdiction offering the incentive. The pre-production phase may take several months and is critical to the success of the project.
 The length of time needed to film varies by project but is typically between three and six weeks. Once the filming is completed, the project will enter the post-production phase, which includes film and sound editing, and development of special effects, as needed. Depending on the complexity of the work to be done, post-production may take from two to six months to complete.
 Over the last six years, we produced and distributed Cybergeddon in partnership with Anthony Zuiker, creator of CSI, Hiding, and South Beach-Fever, and were hired by Dolphin Entertainment, LLC to provide production services for Aim High produced by Dolphin Entertainment, LLC in conjunction with Warner Brothers. Cybergeddon and Aim High have been recognized for their quality and creativity, earning multiple award nominations. Cybergeddon has won a Streamy Award and Aim High has won a WGA Award. Dolphin Films also produced the motion picture, Max Steel, that was released in 2016.
 In 2017, we released a new digital project showcasing favorite restaurants of NFL players throughout the country on Destination America, a digital cable and satellite television channel. We did not derive any revenues from this initial release.
 Our pipeline of feature films includes:
 ·
 Youngblood, an updated version of the 1986 hockey classic;
 
4


·
 Out of Their League, a romantic comedy pitting husband against wife in the cut-throat world of fantasy football; and
 ·
 Ask Me, a teen comedy in which a high-school student starts a business to help her classmates create elaborate Promposals.
 We have completed development of each of these feature films, which means that we have completed the script and can begin pre-production if and when financing is obtained.
Digital and Film Distribution
 Our digital productions for AVOD platforms have premiered on online platforms such as Hulu and Yahoo!. Distribution agreements with online platforms are for a limited period, typically six months. Once the contract expires, we have the ability to distribute our productions in ancillary markets such as through home entertainment, SVOD (e.g., Netflix), pay television, broadcast television, foreign and other markets. Our ability to distribute these productions in ancillary markets is typically based on the popularity of the project during its initial online distribution.
 Similar to distribution of digital productions described above, the economic life of motion pictures is composed of different phases. The motion picture is initially distributed in theaters. A successful motion picture may remain in theaters for several months, after which we have the ability to distribute the motion picture in ancillary markets such as home entertainment, PPV, VOD, EST, SVOD, AVOD, digital rentals, pay television, broadcast television, foreign and other markets. Concurrent with their release in the U.S., motion pictures are generally released in Canada and may also be released in one or more other foreign markets.
 Theatrical distribution refers to the marketing and commercial or retail exploitation of motion pictures. Typically, we enter into an agreement with a distributor to place our films in theatres for a distribution fee. Pursuant to the agreement, the distribution fee varies depending on whether we provide our own P&A financing or whether the distributor finances the P&A.
 Digital and Film Financing
 We have financed our acquisition of the rights to certain digital projects and motion picture productions through a variety of financing structures including equity finance agreements, subscription agreements and loan and security agreements. 
Competition
 The businesses in which we engage are highly competitive. Through 42West, we compete against other public relations and marketing communications companies, as well as independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships. Our content production business faces competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, video games and computer-related activities. We are subject to competition from other digital media and motion production companies, as well as from large, well-established companies within the entertainment industry that have significantly greater development, production, distribution and capital resources than us. We compete for the acquisition of literary properties and for the services of producers, directors, actors and other artists as well as creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our business. In addition, our productions compete for audience acceptance and advertising dollars.
 We believe that we compete on the basis of the following competitive strengths:
 ·
 42West’s long and loyal list of marquee clients—42West’s clients (upwards of 400 in 2017), including many of the world’s most famous and acclaimed screen and pop stars, its most honored directors and producers, every major movie studio, and virtually every digital platform and content distributor, along with a host of production companies and media firms as well as consumer product marketers, is a competitive advantage given the nature of the entertainment marketing and public relations industry;
 
5


·
 a stable and experienced work force, led by an exceptional management team—our CEO, Mr. O’Dowd, has a 20-year history of producing and delivering high-quality family entertainment. In addition, 42West’s three co-CEOs, Leslee Dart, Amanda Lundberg, and Allan Mayer, are all longtime PR practitioners, with decades of experience, widely regarded as being among the top communications strategists in the entertainment industry. They lead a staff of approximately 80 PR professionals that is known for both its skill and its longevity. Our 42West employee base has been steady, with staff turnover that we believe is far below industry norms, and six of the companys seven managing directors have been with 42West for more than nine years; and
 ·
 our ability to offer interrelated services—we believe that the ability to create content for our 42West clients and the ability to internally develop and execute marketing campaigns for our digital and film productions will allow us to expand and grow each of our business lines.
 Employees
 As of March 20, 2018, we had 87 full-time employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also utilize consultants in the ordinary course of our business and hire additional employees on a project-by-project basis in connection with the production of digital media projects or motion pictures.
