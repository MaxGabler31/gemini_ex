Item 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
History of the Business
 
Legacy Card Company (“Legacy”) was formed as a Limited Liability Company on August 29, 2001. On April 18, 2005, Legacy converted from a California Limited Liability Company to a Nevada Corporation. On November 10, 2005, Legacy merged with Cardiff International, Inc. (“Cardiff”, the “Company”), a publicly held corporation in Colorado. On August 27, 2014 Cardiff redomiciled to Florida.
 
In the first quarter of 2013, it was decided to restructure Cardiff into a holding company enabling businesses to take advantage of the power of a public company. Cardiff began targeting the acquisition of undervalued, niche companies with high growth potential, income-producing commercial real estate properties, and high return investments, all designed to pay a dividend to our shareholders. The reason for this strategy was to protect our shareholders by acquiring profitable small- to minimum-sized businesses with little to no debt, seeking support with both financing and management that had the ability to offer a return to investors. The plan is to establish new classes of preferred stock to streamline voting rights, negate debt, and acquire new businesses. By December of 2013, we were able to reduce more than 90% of all its debt; by July of 2014, we had completed the acquisition of three businesses: We Three, LLC; Romeo’s NY Pizza; and Edge View Properties, Inc. We delayed the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to difficulty obtaining information from another acquisition, which was subsequently unwound. By December of 2016 we completed the acquisition of 3 additional businesses and have 2 currently pending lender approvals.

Current Business Operations
 
Cardiff is a public holding company, much like a cooperative, leveraging proven management in private companies that become subsidiaries under our umbrella. Our focus is not based on a specific industry or geographic location, but rather on a proven management, market, and historical operating margin. We target acquisitions of mature, high growth, niche companies. Cardiff’s strategy identifies and empowers select income-producing middle market private businesses and commercial real estate properties.
 
The target company’s management team typically maintains control of the day to day operations. Acquisitions become standalone autonomous subsidiaries that gain the advantages of a publicly traded company without losing their independent management control. Management enjoys the advantage of improved valuation, liquidity, synergies, and support, along with diversification and asset appreciation through collective subsidiary performance. Diversification and pooled resources leverage value and mitigate risk.
