Manufacturing
Our "flexible manufacturing" strategy combines capacity from external foundries with output from our internal manufacturing facilities which allows us to meet fluctuations in customer demand while limiting capital expenditure requirements and lessening the burden of high fixed costs, a capability that is important with our rapidly evolving product portfolio and revenue growth.
As of the end of fiscal year 2018, we owned a wafer fabrication facility in Austin, Texas. External wafer foundries, mainly in Asia, manufactured approximately 63% of our wafers (8 inch equivalent). 
We conduct assembly and test operations at our back-end manufacturing facilities in Cavite, Philippines and Bangkok, Thailand, which contribute to better leverage of manufacturing cost. External assembly and test subcontractors in Asia account for approximately 72% of the total assembly output and 62% of the total test output. Various assembly and test subcontractors in Asia perform the balance of the assembly and test operations.
We have manufacturing services agreements primarily with the following partners:

• | Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. ("ASE") - Agreements for chip scale packing services;


• | Amkor J Devices - Agreements for assembly and test services;


• | Deca Technologies Inc. - Agreement for chip scale packaging services.


• | Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited - Agreements for foundry, sort and assembly and test services;


• | HuaHong Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation ("Grace") - Agreement for foundry services;


• | Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation ("SMIC") - Agreements for foundry services;


• | Skywater Technologies Inc. - Agreement for foundry services;


• | Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacture Company ("TSMC") - Agreement for foundry services;


• | United Microelectronics Corporation ("UMC") - Agreement for foundry services;

8


• | United Test and Assembly Center Ltd - Agreement for assembly and test services; and


• | Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation ("XMC") - Agreement for foundry services.

Sales and Marketing
We sell our semiconductor products through several channels: distributors; manufacturing representative firms; and sales by our sales force directly to original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers. 
Our marketing activities target customers, reference design houses and our potential partners; and include a variety of direct marketing activities, such as trade shows, events and sponsored activities. We augment our sales effort with field application engineers, specialists in our products, technologies and services who work with customers to design our products into their systems. Field application engineers also help us identify emerging markets and new products.
Outstanding accounts receivable from Fujitsu Electronics Inc., one of our distributors accounted for 25% of our consolidated accounts receivable as of December 30, 2018 and 28% of our consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017. 
Revenue generated through Fujitsu Electronics Inc. and Arrow Electronics, two of our distributors, accounted for 18% and 14%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2018, and 20% and 13% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2017, respectively. Revenue generated through Fujitsu Electronics Inc., one of our distributors, accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2016. No other distributor or end-customer accounts for 10% or more of our revenue. 
Backlog
Our sales typically rely upon standard purchase orders for delivery of products with relatively short delivery lead times. Customer relationships are generally not subject to long-term contracts. Although we have entered into long-term supply agreements with certain customers, products to be delivered and the related delivery schedule under these long-term contracts are frequently revised. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues.
Competition
The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and continually evolving. This intense competition results in a challenging operating environment for most companies in this industry. This environment is characterized by the potential erosion of sale prices over the life of each product, rapid technological change, limited product life cycles, and strong domestic and foreign competition in many markets. Our ability to compete successfully depends on many factors, including:
•our success in developing new products and manufacturing technologies;
•delivery, performance, quality and price of our products;
•diversity of our products and timeliness of new product introductions;
•cost effectiveness of our design, development, manufacturing and marketing efforts;
•quality of our customer service, relationships and reputation;

• | overall success with which our customers market and sell their products and solutions that incorporate our products; and

•number and nature of our competitors and general economic conditions.
We face competition from domestic and foreign semiconductor manufacturers, many of which have advanced technological capabilities and greater brand recognition and have increased their participation in the markets in which we operate. We compete with a large number of companies primarily in the automotive, industrial, consumer, and enterprise markets. Companies that compete directly with our businesses include, but are not limited to, Adesto, Everspin Technologies, Fujitsu, GigaDevice Semiconductor, GSI Technology, Hynix, Integrated Silicon Solution, Macronix, Marvell, MediaTek, Microchip Technology, Micron Technology, Nordic Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors NV, Qualcomm, Realtek, Renesas, Richtek, Semtech, Silicon Laboratories, ST Microelectronics, Texas Instruments, Toshiba, VIA Labs, XMC and Winbond.
Environmental Regulations
9

We use, generate and discharge hazardous chemicals and waste in our research and development and manufacturing activities. United States federal, state and local jurisdictions, in addition to the foreign countries in which we operate, impose various environmental rules and obligations, which are becoming increasingly stringent over time, intended to protect the environment and in particular to regulate the management and disposal of hazardous substances. We also face increasing complexity in our product design as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including the restrictions on lead and other hazardous substances that apply to specified electronic products put on the market in the European Union (Restriction on the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC, also known as the “RoHS Directive”) and similar legislation in China and California. We are committed to the continual improvement of our environmental systems and controls. However, we cannot provide assurance that we have been, or will at all times be, in complete compliance with all environmental laws and regulations. Other laws impose liability on owners and operators of real property for any contamination of the property even if they did not cause or know of the contamination. While to date we have not experienced any material adverse impact on our business from environmental regulations, we cannot provide assurance that environmental regulations will not impose expensive obligations on us in the future, or otherwise result in the incurrence of liabilities such as the following:
•a requirement to increase capital or other costs to comply with such regulations or to restrict discharges;
•liabilities to our employees and/or third parties; and
•business interruptions as a consequence of permit suspensions or revocations, or as a consequence of the 
 granting of injunctions requested by governmental agencies or private parties.
Intellectual Property
We have an active program to obtain patent and other intellectual property protection for our proprietary technologies, products and other inventions that are aligned with our strategic initiatives. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and proprietary information to maintain and enhance our competitive position in the domestic and international markets we serve. As of the end of fiscal 2018, we had approximately 3,450 issued patents and approximately 644 additional patent applications on file domestically and internationally. In addition, in fiscal 2019 we are preparing to file up to 40 new patent applications in the United States and up to approximately 50 foreign application predominantly in Europe and Asia. The average remaining life of our domestic patent portfolio is approximately 8.9 years.
In addition to factors such as innovation, technological expertise and experienced personnel, we believe that patents are increasingly important to remain competitive in our industry, defend our position in existing markets and to facilitate the entry of our proprietary products into new markets. As our technologies are deployed in new applications and we face new competitors, we will likely subject ourselves to new potential infringement claims and discover third-party infringement of our intellectual property. Patent litigation, if and when instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources. We are committed to vigorously defending and protecting our investment in our intellectual property. We believe the strength of our intellectual property program, including the breadth and depth of our portfolio, will be critical to our success, although, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other intellectual property right.
In addition to developing patents based on our own research and development efforts, we license some patents from third parties, and we may purchase or license additional patents from third parties. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual property, may obtain or already have patents that allegedly or otherwise cover products similar to ours. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all.
We review our intellectual property portfolio from time to time to identify opportunities to derive additional value from our assets. We may consider selling certain patents that no longer align with our patent strategies as well as employ other monetization models for our patent portfolio. From time to time we have divested patents that were not relevant to our current business. Divestiture of patents may lead to future contingent or non-contingent income. 
Employees
As of December 30, 2018, we had 5,846 employees. Geographically, 1,819 employees were located in the United States, 964 in the Philippines, 924 in Thailand, 592 in India, 457 in Japan, 341 in Malaysia, 297 in Greater China, 
10

242 in Europe, and 210 in other countries. Of the total employees, 3,220 employees were associated with manufacturing, 1,481 with research and development, and 1,145 with selling, general and administrative functions.
