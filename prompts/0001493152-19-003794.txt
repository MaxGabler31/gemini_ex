ITEM 1. Business
Overview
 
We are an in-vitro diagnostic company based in Escondido, California. We have commercialized a proprietary tear testing platform, the TearLab® Osmolarity System that enables eye care practitioners to test for highly sensitive and specific biomarkers using nanoliters of tear film at the point-of-care. Our first product measures tear film osmolarity for the diagnosis of Dry Eye Disease or DED. Our results are included in our financial statements, which are included under Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
TearLab Research, Inc.
 
TearLab Research, Inc. (“TearLab Research”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, develops technologies to enable eye care practitioners to test a wide range of biomarkers (chemistries, metabolites, genes and proteins) at the point-of-care. Commercializing that tear testing platform is now the focus of our business.
 
Our current product, the TearLab® Osmolarity System, enables the rapid measurement of tear osmolarity in the doctor’s office. Osmolarity is a quantitative and highly specific biomarker that has been shown to assist in the diagnosis and management of DED. Based on the Beaver Dam Offspring Study (2005-2008), prevalence of DED was 14.5% across an adult population aged 21-84, impacting 17.9% of women and 10.5% of men in the study. The innovation of the TearLab® Osmolarity System is its ability to precisely and rapidly measure osmolarity in nanoliter volumes of tear samples, using a highly efficient and novel tear collection system at the point of care. Historically, eye care researchers have relied on expensive instruments to perform tear biomarker analysis. In addition to their cost, these conventional systems are slow, highly variable in their measurement readings, and not categorized as waived by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), under regulations promulgated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, (“CLIA”).
 
The TearLab® Osmolarity System consists of the following three components: (1) the TearLab disposable, which is a single-use microfluidic microchip; (2) the TearLab Pen, which is a hand-held device that interfaces with the TearLab disposable; and (3) the TearLab Reader, which is a small desktop unit that allows for the docking of the TearLab Pen and provides a quantitative reading for the operator.
 
In October 2008, the TearLab® Osmolarity System received CE mark approval, clearing the way for sales in the European Union and all countries recognizing the CE mark. On December 8, 2009, TearLab announced that Health Canada issued a Medical Device License for the TearLab® Osmolarity System.

On May 19, 2009, we announced that we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. On January 23, 2012, we announced the FDA had granted the waiver categorization under CLIA for the TearLab® Osmolarity System. The CLIA waiver reduces the regulatory paperwork and related administrative time for customers.
 
On January 4, 2018, we announced that we had submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA for the potential clearance of the TearLab DiscoveryTM Platform. The submission covers Discovery and the MMP-9 biomarker. On February 14, 2018, we announced that the application had successfully passed the acceptance review phase with the FDA. On April 11, 2018 we announced that we received written feedback from the FDA, requesting that we provide additional information to establish correlation to the FDA-cleared predicate chosen to establish 510(k) substantial equivalence. On September 4, 2018, we submitted, and the FDA accepted, our response to the FDA’s comments regarding the 510(k) application for the Discovery Platform. On October 10, 2018, we announced that the FDA determined that the TearLab Discovery™ MMP-9 test, had not met the criteria for substantial equivalence based upon data and information we had submitted. We plan to utilize the guidance provided by the FDA to compile the additional information necessary to resubmit for 510(k) clearance. After securing FDA clearance, we intend to pursue a CLIA waiver in an effort to prepare for commercialization in the US market.
 
Currently, the TearLab®Osmolarity System is commercialized in over 40 countries. In the United States, the TearLab Osmolarity System is sold direct. In markets outside of the US, the TearLab® Osmolarity System is sold through distributors.
 
Industry
 
Point-of-care Testing and DED
 
The market research firm, “Markets and Markets” reports the global market for point-of-care testing will reach $37.0 billion annually by 2021. Approximately 75% of all laboratory tests today are performed at centralized clinical laboratories. However, diagnostic testing is increasingly being performed at the point-of-care due to several factors, including a need for rapid testing in acute care situations, the benefits of patient monitoring and disease management, streamlining therapeutic decision making and the overall trend toward personalized medicine. We believe that advances in bio-detection technologies that can simplify and accelerate the rate of performing complex diagnostic tests at the point-of-care will drive utilization and overall point-of-care testing market growth.
 
Each time a person blinks, his or her eyes are resurfaced with a thin layer of a complex fluid known as the tear film. The tear film works to protect eyes from the outside world. Bacteria, viruses, sand, freezing winds and salt water (inclusive of most environmental factors) will not damage eyes when the tear film is intact. However, when compromised, a deficient tear film can be an exceedingly painful and disruptive condition. The tear film consists of three components: (i) an innermost mucin layer (produced by the surface goblet cells); (ii) the aqueous layer (the water in tears, produced by the lacrimal gland); and (iii) an oily lipid layer which limits evaporation of the tears (produced by the meibomian glands, located at the margins of the eyelids). The apparatus of the ocular surface forms an integrated unit. When working correctly, the tear film presents a smooth optical surface essential for clear vision and proper immunity. Androgen deficiency, contact lens wear and chronic inflammation of the lacrimal or meibomian glands may lead to the condition known as dry eye, which has been likened to arthritis of the eye, and results in a compromised, fragile tear film. In turn, the unstable tear film undermines vision, altering focus between every blink. An unstable tear film is the equivalent of a smudge atop the lens of a camera. It doesn’t matter how many megapixels your camera has, if the first lens is compromised, the image will be fuzzy.

DED is often a result of aging, diabetes, cancer therapy, HIV, autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren’s syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, LASIK surgery, contact lens wear, menopause and as a side effect of hormone replacement therapy. Numerous commonly prescribed and over-the-counter medications also can cause, or contribute to, the manifestation of DED.
 
Discomfort and dryness are the most commonly reported symptoms of contact lens wear. These symptoms can lead to contact lens drop out if severe and/or persistent. In 2010, Contact Lens Spectrum reported that 16% of contact lens wearers permanently dropout of contact lens wear each year. In addition, there are approximately 600,000 LASIK procedures performed in the U.S each year with up to 60% reporting dry eye symptoms 1 month post-LASIK.
 
Diagnostic Alternatives for Dry Eye Disease
 
Existing diagnostic tools are highly subjective, do not correlate well with symptoms, are invasive for patients and may require up to an hour of operator time to perform. All of these factors have constrained the objective diagnosis and treatment of the DED patient population. As physicians have not had access to objective, quantitative diagnostic assays that correlate well with and the severity of DED disease, it has been difficult for them to objectively differentiate DED symptoms from other eye diseases that present with very similar symptoms, such as ocular allergies, conjunctivochalasis or infectious bacterial or viral diseases. To treat DED effectively and to mitigate the emotional and physical effects of this disease, it is important to equip physicians with objective, quantitative measurements of disease pathogenesis so they can determine more accurately the most efficacious treatments for their patients.
 
Osmolarity in DED presents itself as an increase in the salt concentration of the tear film. For over 50 years, studies have shown that tear film osmolarity is an ideal biomarker for diagnosing DED, providing an objective, quantitative measurement of disease pathogenesis. Measuring osmolarity also serves as an effective disease management tool by providing physicians with an ability to personalize therapeutic intervention and to track patient outcomes quantitatively. Osmolarity testing could also provide physicians with a tool to identify patients at risk for dropping out of contact lens wear early in disease progression, as well as an invaluable test to guide the type and duration of therapy prior to, and following refractive surgery.
 
The main challenge in measuring osmolarity at the point-of-care is the small volume of tear available for testing. Older laboratory osmometers require upwards of ten microliters of fluid to produce a single reading. In addition, these instruments are not particularly suitable for use in a physician’s office, since they require continual calibration, cleaning and maintenance. Existing osmometers currently are marketed primarily to reference and hospital laboratories for the measurement of osmolarity in blood, urine and other serum samples.
 
TearLab’s Product
 
Our TearLab® Osmolarity System is an integrated testing system comprised of: (1) the TearLab disposable, which is a single-use microfluidic microchip; (2) the TearLab Pen, which is a hand-held device that interfaces with the TearLab disposable; and (3) the TearLab Reader, which is a small desktop unit that allows for the docking of the TearLab Pen and provides a quantitative reading for the operator. The innovation of the TearLab® Osmolarity System is its ability to measure precisely, rapidly, and inexpensively biomarkers in nanoliter volumes of tear samples or approximately 1,000 times less volume than required for older laboratory devices.
 
The operator of the TearLab® Osmolarity System, most commonly a technician, collects the tear sample from the patient’s eye in the TearLab disposable, using the TearLab Pen. After the tear has been collected, the operator places the Pen into the Reader. The TearLab Reader then will display an osmolarity reading to the operator. Following the completion of the test, the TearLab disposable will be discarded and a new TearLab disposable will be readied for the next test. The entire process, from sample to answer, should require approximately two minutes or less to complete.
 
The TearLab Discovery™ System, (“Discovery”) is our next generation of comprehensive in-vitro diagnostic testing platform and, if approved, will offer eye care professionals the ability to assess multiple biomarkers in human tears with a single nanoliter volume tear collection. On January 4, 2018, we announced that we had submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA for the potential clearance of Discovery. The submission covers Discovery and the MMP-9 biomarker. On February 14, 2018, we announced that the application had successfully passed the acceptance review phase with the FDA. On April 11, 2018 we announced that we received written feedback from the FDA, requesting that we provide additional information to establish correlation to the FDA-cleared predicate chosen to establish 510(k) substantial equivalence. On September 4, 2018, we submitted, and the FDA accepted, our response to the FDA’s comments regarding the 510(k) application for the Discovery Platform. On October 10, 2018, we announced that the FDA determined that the TearLab Discovery™ MMP-9 test, had not met the criteria for substantial equivalence based upon data and information we submitted. We plan to utilize the guidance provided by the FDA to compile the additional information necessary to resubmit for 510(k) clearance. After securing FDA clearance, we intend to pursue a CLIA waiver in an effort to prepare for commercialization in the US market.

Competition
 
The medical device industry is highly competitive and we face potential competition from medical device companies worldwide. There are several laboratory technologies that claim to measure the osmolarity of nanoliter tear samples. The i-Pen manufactured by i-Med Pharma, Inc. has approval from Health Canada and a CE mark. i-Med Pharma, Inc. announced the filing of a 510(k) application for clearance in the United States of the i-Pen in December of 2017. The LacriPen, developed by LacriSciences, LLC (Washington, DC, US), does not have a CE Mark, FDA 510(k) clearance or a CLIA waiver, but has stated to be in clinical trials. Another investigational device aimed at dry eye diagnosis, the TeaRx, manufactured by DiagnosTear Ltd., a division of BioLight Life Sciences Investments of Tel Aviv, Israel, announced positive correlations between TeaRx diagnostic parameters and benchmarks used to test for dry eye syndrome. Another non-osmolarity based in vitro diagnostic test for dry eye was developed by Rapid Pathogen Screening, Inc. (RPS), of Sarasota Florida. RPS commercialized a tear test for dry eye that measures MMP-9, an inflammatory biomarker which was subsequently acquired by Quidel Corporation, a major American manufacturer of diagnostic healthcare products marketed globally. This test, which is currently marketed by the Quidel Corporation in the U.S. is FDA cleared and has obtained a CLIA waiver. Another company, ATD (Advanced Tear Diagnostics) has a CLIA classification of Moderately Complex in the United States, and markets products that measure lactoferrin and IgE in human tears for the diagnosis of aqueous deficient dry eye disease and ocular allergy, respectively.
 
Tear film break-up time, or TBUT, is a non-laboratory test performed to evaluate tear film stability during an examination of the ocular surface with a slit lamp by an eye care practitioner. However, it is subjective, requires a physician to instill a carefully controlled amount of fluorescein dye into the eye and requires a stopwatch to determine the endpoint. TBUT has been shown to be unreliable as a determinant of DED since shortened TBUT does not always correlate well with other signs or symptoms.
 
Other office-based tests performed during a standard eye care examination like impression cytology and corneal staining, although indicative of relatively late stage phenomena in DED, are subjective, qualitative and generally do not correlate to disease pathogenesis. We believe the Schirmer Test, to determine tear fluid volume, is an imprecise marker of tear function since its diagnostic results vary significantly.
 
Principal Suppliers
 
We rely on two suppliers based in the United States for the manufacture of the Readers and Pens which are key components of the TearLab® Osmolarity System. We also rely on a single supplier, MiniFAB (Aust) Pty Ltd. located in Australia, for the manufacture of the test cards which is also a key component of the TearLab® Osmolarity System.

We intend to rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to further develop our proprietary position. Our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for the TearLab® Osmolarity System, the TearLab Discovery TM System and related technology and processes, and our ability to operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our intellectual property rights, will have a substantial impact on our ability to succeed in our business. Although we intend to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, continuing to file patent applications, the patent position of companies like TearLab is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify a proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any part of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents, those that may be issued in the future or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop would-be competitors from marketing tests identical to the TearLab® Osmolarity System. Specific to the market in Canada, the Company initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against i-Med Pharma, Inc. in February of 2016 alleging infringement of the Company’s Canadian patent. In February 2018, the Federal Court of Canada issued a ruling in favor of i-Med Pharma, Inc. which invalidated specific claims in the Company’s Canadian patent which were alleged to be infringed. The Company is appealing this ruling to the Canadian Federal Appellate Court. As part of the ruling, the Federal Court ruling awarded costs to i-Med Pharma, Inc., for $0.5 million. The final $0.2 million was paid in April 2018. We do not believe that the outcome of this litigation will materially affect our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.
 
In addition to patent protection, we have registered the TearLab trademark in the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Australia, Canada, China and Turkey.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing of our product, which is a medical device. In the United States, the FDA regulates medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, administrative fines or criminal prosecution.
 
Unless exempted by regulation, medical devices may not be commercially distributed in the United States until they have been cleared or approved by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of the three classes, Class I, II or III, on the basis of the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to general controls, such as labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to good manufacturing practices. The TearLab ® Osmolarity System is a Class I, non-exempt device and qualifies for the 510(k) procedure. Under the FDA’s Section 510(k) procedure, the manufacturer provides a pre-market notification that it intends to begin marketing the product, and shows that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product, that it has the same intended use and is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a legally marketed device. In some cases, the submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. On May 19, 2009, we announced that we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the TearLab® Osmolarity System.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification to the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, would require a new 510(k) clearance or an approval of a Premarket Approval, or PMA. A PMA is the FDA process of scientific or regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices which are those devices which support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Although the FDA requires the manufacturer to make the initial determination regarding the effect of a modification to the device that is subject to 510(k) clearance, the FDA can review the manufacturer’s determination at any time and require the manufacturer to seek another 510(k) clearance or an approval of a PMA.

CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. The regulations promulgated under CLIA establish three levels of in vitro diagnostic tests: (1) waiver; (2) moderately complex; and (3) highly complex. The standards applicable to a clinical laboratory depend on the level of diagnostic tests it performs. A CLIA waiver is available to clinical laboratory test systems if they meet certain requirements established by the statute. Waived tests are simple laboratory examinations and procedures employing methodologies that are so simple and accurate as to render the likelihood of erroneous results negligible or to pose no reasonable risk of harm to patients if the examinations or procedures are performed incorrectly. These tests are waived from regulatory oversight of the user other than the requirement to follow the manufacturer’s labeling and directions for use. On January 23, 2012, we announced that the FDA had granted the waiver categorization under CLIA for the TearLab® Osmolarity System.
 
Regardless of whether a medical device requires FDA clearance or approval, a number of other FDA requirements apply to the device, its manufacturer and those who distribute it. Device manufacturers must be registered and their products listed with the FDA, and certain adverse events and product malfunctions must be reported to the FDA. The FDA also regulates the product labeling, promotion and, in some cases, advertising of medical devices. In addition, manufacturers and their suppliers must comply with the FDA’s quality system regulation which establishes extensive requirements for quality and manufacturing procedures. Thus, suppliers, manufacturers and distributors must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain compliance, and failure to comply can lead to enforcement action. The FDA periodically inspects facilities to ascertain compliance with these and other requirements.
