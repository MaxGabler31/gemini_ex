ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leading provider of comprehensive automation and business analytics software solutions for patient-centric medication and supply management across the entire healthcare continuum, from the acute care hospital setting to post-acute skilled nursing and long-term care facilities to the home. Our Automation and Analytics segment has more than 4,000 customers worldwide using our supply chain and analytics solutions to help enable them to increase operational efficiency, reduce errors, deliver actionable intelligence and improve patient safety. Our acquisition of Aesynt Holding, L.P., Aesynt, Ltd. and Aesynt Coöperatief U.A. (collectively, “Aesynt”) in the first quarter of 2016 and the acquisition of Dixie Drawl, LLC d/b/a InPharmics ("InPharmics") in the second quarter of 2017 contribute to our distinct product capabilities, particularly in central pharmacy and IV robotics, creating the broadest medication management product portfolio in the industry. 
Our Medication Adherence segment includes solutions, among them our MTS Medication Technologies, SureMed and Patient Management Access Portal brands, and provides innovative medication adherence packaging solutions designed to improve medication regiment adherence and to help reduce costly hospital readmissions. Our acquisition of ateb Inc., and its affiliate, Ateb Canada Ltd., (collectively, "Ateb"), providers of pharmacy-based patient care solutions and medication synchronization to independent and chain pharmacies, in the fourth quarter of 2016, uniquely positions Omnicell to support pharmacists as they implement and scale their adherence programs. Collectively, our Medication Adherence solutions help enable over 32,000 institutional and retail pharmacies worldwide to maintain high accuracy and quality standards in medication dispensing and administration while optimizing productivity and controlling costs.
According to a 2016 study by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), medication errors cause at least one death every day and injure approximately 1.3 million people annually in the United States. The healthcare industry has become increasingly aware that human factors inevitably create the risk of medication administration errors in the course of patient care. Acute care facilities are required to adhere to medication regulatory controls that we believe cannot be adequately supported by manual tracking systems or partially automated systems. Any nursing shortages would add an additional challenge to acute care facilities to meet regulatory controls and improve patient safety while still providing adequate patient care. Non-acute care facilities face similar safety challenges. In its 2003 "Adherence to Long-Term Therapies-Evidence for Action" the World Health Organization stated that across diseases, adherence is the single most important modifiable factor that compromises treatment outcome and medication adherence is viewed as a key requirement for delivering better clinical outcomes and financial results. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services stated in 2012 that 11% of all hospital admissions were related to medication non-adherence. In the United States, according to the Express Scripts 2013 Drug Trend Report, avoidable healthcare costs add up to $213 billion, of which about $105 billion is due to medication non-adherence. In a 2013 report, Levine & Associates estimated that to be approximately $2,000 per patient annually.
We provide solutions to help healthcare systems and caregivers address these aforementioned needs. We believe our solutions align us with the long-term trends of the healthcare market to manage the health of patients across the continuum of care, and that our patient-centric medication and supply management solutions help improve workflow efficiencies and patient outcomes.

Pharmacy Automation System utilizes robotics to automate critical workflows to help maximize inventory control, improve efficiency, and increase medication safety. Our VBM 200F, an automated system designed specifically for multi-medication adherence packaging, minimizes human activity in the multi-medication packaging process, thus reducing opportunity for errors, which helps improve medication adherence and patient outcomes. The IVX Workflow, a sterile compounding workflow solution, is designed for easy placement within laminar airflow (LAF) hoods or isolators to supports best practices in aseptic technique. Our SupplyX solution (currently available in the United Kingdom) is a web based, real time stock level information dashboard and reporting suite.
Acquisitions
In addition to our own development, we have, from time to time, acquired products that extend patient safety controls to a wider range of applications and departments in and out of the hospital setting. Our acquisitions include MTS Medication Technologies Limited ("MTS") in 2012, Surgichem Limited ("Surgichem") in 2014, Mach4 Automatisierungstechnik GmbH (“Mach4”) and Avantec Healthcare Limited (“Avantec”) in 2015, Aesynt and Ateb in 2016 and InPharmics in 2017. MTS extended our product line to include solutions for Medication Adherence customers, Surgichem was a provider of medication adherence products in the United Kingdom, Mach4 develops automated medication management systems to retail and hospital pharmacy customers primarily in Europe, with additional installations in China, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, and Avantec was our distributor of medication and supply automation configurations of our products suited to the United Kingdom marketplace. 
On April 12, 2017, we completed the acquisition of InPharmics, a leading source for end-to-end medication use process cost analytics and Drug Supply Chain Security Act compliance systems specifically designed for acute care hospital pharmacies. The InPharmics solution adds clinical and compliance analytics to Omnicell’s Performance Center offering, positioning us as a leading partner for health systems seeking to drive improvement across all facets of medication management.
On January 5, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Aesynt, a leader in central pharmacy robotics and IV compounding automation. Adding these two solution sets to the Omnicell portfolio was intended to give us one of the most comprehensive medication management platform offerings in the industry. We now are able to support customers who desire a centralized cartfill or nurse server medication distribution model all the way to fully decentralized dispensing and hybrid combinations along that continuum. We are also able to offer solutions for IV preparations, including oncology drugs, which is an area where our combined customers have expressed significant interest. 
On December 8, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Ateb, a leading provider of pharmacy-based patient care solutions and medication synchronization to independent and chain retail pharmacies, an area where we had no market penetration prior to the acquisition. Ateb’s Time My Meds® solution, a market leading integrated medication synchronization program, combined with Omnicell’s SureMed® medication adherence packaging and related automation solutions, uniquely positions Omnicell to support pharmacists as they implement and scale their adherence programs. 
Industry Background
The delivery of healthcare in the United States still relies on a significant number of manual and paper-based processes. Most hospitals have deployed at least some automation solutions, but few have deployed them throughout the entire institution or system. The use of manual and paper-based systems in many hospital departments today results in highly complex and inefficient processes for tracking and delivering medications and supplies to patients. In addition, many existing healthcare information systems are unable to support the modernization of healthcare delivery processes or address mandated patient safety initiatives. These factors contribute to medical errors and unnecessary process costs across the healthcare sector.
Healthcare providers and facilities are affected by significant economic pressures. Rising costs of labor, prescription drugs and new medical technology all contribute to increased spending. Governmental pressures surrounding healthcare reform have led to increased scrutiny of the cost and efficiency with which healthcare providers deliver their services. These factors, combined with continuing consolidation in the healthcare industry, have increased the need for the efficient delivery of healthcare in order to control costs.
Our Automation and Analytics products are sold worldwide to a wide variety of healthcare institutions, but most of our sales are to acute care hospital customers in the United States. The U.S. acute care hospital market is comprised of approximately 6,400 hospitals and other facilities with a total capacity of more than a million acute care beds. We currently serve over 4,000 hospitals and other facilities with total capacity of more than 580,000 acute care beds. Our customers include single location community hospitals, government hospitals and regional and national hospital systems.
7

We also sell our Automation and Analytics products directly to non-acute care providers, which include all healthcare facilities that are not hospitals. We estimate there are 50,000 facilities in the United States that could use our Automation and Analytics products and few of them use our solutions at this time. 
Outside the United States, healthcare providers are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of automation. Many governmental and private entities look to the progress made over the last several years in the United States and are starting to invest significantly in information technology and automation. The 2016 BCC Research report states that worldwide inpatient pharmacy automation revenue growth in our industry between 2016 and 2021 is expected to be 7.9%. We sell our Automation and Analytics products in a variety of countries outside of the United States, but to date we have focused our international sales efforts on Canada, the United Kingdom, the Middle East, and the Northern European region. Our international customer base includes over 450 customers that utilize our automation and analytics products.
We primarily sell our Medication Adherence products to institutional and retail pharmacies. In the United States, where approximately 80% of our Medication Adherence business occurs, the market is comprised of approximately 1,200 institutional and approximately 67,000 pharmacies that service over 50,000 long-term care facilities. In addition to medication control at long-term care facilities, our multi-medication products provide packaging that simplifies the process for individuals providing self-care to track and administer medications in domestic and global markets. Our acquisition of Ateb allows us to increase our capabilities to support retail pharmacies in synchronizing prescriptions for multi-med packaging and patient engagement for better adherence.
Key Industry Events and Reports
Legislation and industry guidelines, such as those produced by the FDA, The Joint Commission, the U.S. Pharmacopial Convention (the “USP”), and the Institute for Safe Medication Practices ("ISMP"), as well as the desire of healthcare organizations to improve quality and avoid liability, have driven health system facilities to prioritize investment in capital equipment, including pharmacy automation, which is a standard of care, to improve patient safety. Such reports and regulatory standards include the following:

• | In 2016, the USP finalized a set of guidelines known as USP 800 to address hazardous drug handling in health care settings. The regulations deal with transport, storage, compounding, preparation, and administration of intravenous products. Changing work practices and administrative controls to comply with these requirements are expected to increase both staff and patient safety. In September 2017, USP announced its intent to postpone the official date that USP 800 becomes official to December 1, 2019.


• | ISMP’s 2016-2017 best practices for hospitals include using technology to assist in the medication verification process (e.g., barcode scanning verification of ingredients, gravimetric verification, robotics, IV workflow software) to augment manual processes. It is important that processes are in place to ensure that the technology is maintained, the software is updated and the technology is always used in a manner that maximizes the medication safety features of those systems.


• | A 2016 Joint Commission survey of ambulatory care organizations revealed one of the most cited standards for non-compliance is having a practice of safely storing medications. The Joint Commission's updated medication management (MM) standards became effective January 1, 2018 for all accredited ambulatory care organizations and office-based surgery practices. These facilities need to improve processes for securing, controlling, refrigerating and administering medications.


• | The FDA Drug Supply Chain Security Act was signed into law in 2013 (Title II of Public Law 113-54) as a way to identify and trace medications. Organizations participating in the medication supply chain were required to comply beginning in November 2017 with full traceability complete by 2023. This requires a product identifier carrying information including serial number, lot number, and expiration date. Trading partners (manufacturers, wholesalers, dispensers, repackagers) will be able to share data regarding the status and movement of medications throughout the supply chain.


• | In 2010, the FDA updated its guidance that requires linear bar codes on most prescription drugs. Drug manufacturers, re-packagers, re-labelers and private label distributors are subject to the rule. The FDA estimated that the bar code rule, would result in a 50% reduction in medication errors, 500,000 fewer adverse drug events over the subsequent 20 years, $93 billion in cost savings and other economic benefits.


• | In 2002, the Joint Commission established the National Patient Safety Goals ("NPSG") program. In 2010, NPSG 03.04.01, National Patient Safety Goal on Labeling Medications, required the labeling of all medications, medication containers (syringes, medicine cups, basins, etc.) and other solutions on and off the sterile field in perioperative and other procedural settings.

While the overall storage and security of medications in hospitals has improved, recent years show increased focus on controlled substance management. Joint Commission surveyors are seeking more documentation from hospitals demonstrating policies and procedures are adequate.
Medication non-adherence is extremely common. According to research by Osterberg and Blaschke published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2005, more than half of the 3.2 billion prescriptions dispensed annually in the United States are not taken as prescribed, and according to numerous studies, the same non-adherence rate exists for chronic disease medications. Poor adherence results in significant morbidity, mortality and avoidable healthcare costs. With more than 38 million Americans taking five or more maintenance medications daily, pharmacists need ways to support the arduous task of keeping patients compliant. According to the World Health Organization, “although these medications are effective in combating disease, their full benefits are often not realized because approximately 50% of patients do not take their medications as prescribed". According to a study published by IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics in 2013, the avoidable cost of poor medication adherence is estimated at more than $105 billion in the United States alone.
Medication adherence can be improved through attitudinal and behavioral changes, which pharmacists can encourage and help facilitate by providing interventional support, including adherence tools, such as blister cards, reminders, prescription synchronization, and patient engagement tools. A 2011 study by CVS Caremark published in Health Affairs concluded that the medical cost per patient with chronic vascular disease was $13,000 to $39,000, annually, and patients who take medications as directed by a physician experienced medical savings ranging from $1,900 to $8,900, annually. The study also found that these patients experienced fewer emergency room visits and inpatient hospital stays. Additionally, 28 states in the United States have passed laws or regulations to improve the medication adherence.
Healthcare Reform 
In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("PPACA"), which prescribes broad-based measures designed to provide healthcare to a greater percentage of the population. Even though the future of PPACA is unclear under the current administration, healthcare reform has set in motion the need for increased efficiency in order to provide high-quality healthcare at the lower cost. Accordingly, in our annual tracking of pharmacy and nursing leadership mindshare, operational efficiencies in medication distribution and administration continue to be a top priority.
We believe our products assist healthcare organizations to augment their investments in electronic health record ("EHR") implementation and integration by allowing them to reduce process steps, eliminate manual tracking and waste, enable population-level performance insights, track quality levels and reduce errors that result in unnecessary cost. Our Unity platform includes an automated dispensing system that is Modular EHR stage 2 certified and integrates with all "hospital information system vendors," as defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Our Omnicell Analytics solution provides enterprise-level insights that can assist in monitoring hospital performance and quality of care. In addition, the solutions provided by the Performance CenterTM software products give the customer the power to optimize the pharmacy supply chain with tools that help manage their inventory and minimize the cost of expiring medications.
Automation and Analytics Products and Services
Our Automation and Analytics products are designed to enable our customers to enhance and improve the effectiveness of the medication-use process, the efficiency of the medical-surgical supply chain, overall patient care and clinical and financial outcomes of medical facilities. Through modular configuration and upgrades, our systems can be tailored to specific customer needs. From the point at which a medication arrives at the hospital receiving dock until the time it is administered to the patient, our systems are capable of storing, packaging, bar coding, ordering and issuing the medication, as well as providing information and controls on its use and reorder. Our medication-use product line includes systems for medication dispensing in acute care nursing departments and nursing workflow automation at the bedside, central pharmacy automation, IV solutions and analytics and performance services. These products range from industrial-grade software-driven robotic solutions for automating the management of inventory in the central pharmacy to high-security closed-cabinet systems and software to open-shelf and combination solutions in the nursing unit, catheterization lab and operating room. Our supply product lines provide healthcare facilities with cost data that enables detailed quantification of charges for payer reimbursement, inventory management, implant monitoring and the timely reordering of supplies. To provide our customers with end-to-end medication control, our product lines incorporate bar code technology throughout. Our solutions incorporate software, which we believe is the most advanced on the market today, and our Unity enterprise platform integrates disparate systems onto a single server. We also provide services, including customer education and training, to help customers to optimize their use of our technology.

Medical and Surgical Supply Products
Our medical and surgical supply products provide acute care hospitals control over consumable supplies critical to providing quality healthcare. These solutions provide inventory control software that is designed to ensure that critical supplies are always stocked in the right locations. At the same time, usage tracking helps hospital administrators ensure that money is not wasted on excessive stores of supplies and helps optimize reimbursement by improving charge capture.
Implantable tissue and bone grafts can also be monitored and tracked for additional patient safety and regulatory compliance. The bone and tissue features are integrated with our overall medical and surgical supply chain inventory management and charge capture systems. These solutions are designed for use in the materials management department, the nursing unit and specialty areas such as the catheterization lab and the operating room. They integrate with other information management systems and use bar code technology extensively.
Our supply product line includes the Omnicell Supply Management System, Omnicell Tissue Center, OptiFlexTM MS, OptiFlexTM SS, OptiFlexTM CL and our SupplyX subscription software solution. Each of these products is summarized in the table below:

Product | Use in Hospital | Description 
Omnicell Supply Management System | Any nursing area in a hospital department that uses patient care supplies | An automated dispensing system that automates the management and dispensing of medical and surgical supplies at the point of use. It works with closed Omnicell cabinets and open shelving.

Omnicell Supply Management System is a dispensing system that runs off the OmniCenter® server. It dispenses and tracks medical and surgical supplies at the point of use, and tracks lot and serial numbers. The system can be used with either open shelves or secure automated dispensing cabinets, or a combination of both. Areas that require the management of high volume/low dollar inventory as well as areas where space restrictions limit the ability to install closed cabinets and other areas such as off-site clinics may benefit from an open shelf system that includes a touchscreen PC, scanner or mobile solution. When Omnicell cabinets are used, facilities can choose to implement a hybrid cabinet that stores both medications and supplies.
Omnicell Tissue Center used in conjunction with the OptiFlex platform, allows the operating room staff to manage the chain of custody for bone and tissue specimens from the donor to the patient in the operating room. This solution enables compliance with The Joint Commission requirements and Association of Operating Room Nurses guidelines regarding the handling of tissue specimens.
OptiFlexTM Medical Surgical (MS) provides control over general medical and surgical supplies stored in open shelves or in automated dispensing cabinets.
OptiFlexTM Surgical Services (SS) manages supplies and preference cards in the perioperative areas whether the supplies are stored on open shelves or in automated dispensing cabinets. The preference-list system creates a unique bar code for each surgical case, based on physician, procedure and patient and provides information on the case for data analysis, reporting including real-time case cost and charge capture. The Catheter Module is designed to be integrated into the Omnicell supply cabinet to secure, dispense and automatically track catheter usage.
OptiFlexTM Cath Lab (CL) manages supplies and creates cases in the cardiac catheterization lab, interventional radiology suite and other procedure areas. This solution allows real-time point-of-use data collection and accurate supply tracking regardless of whether supplies are stored on open shelves or in automated dispensing cabinets. It also improves cost management through automated charge capture and case profiling by the physician. Bar code scanning captures lot, serial numbers, and expiration date, providing quick access in the event of a product recall. The Catheter Module is designed to be 
14

integrated into the Omnicell supply cabinet and allows hospitals to secure, dispense and electronically track accurate catheter usage.

RFID Solutions Kanban and specialized cabinet based dispensing systems running on the Unity platform which utilize Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to identify supply inventory. 
Medication Adherence Products and Services
We offer solutions to assist patients to remain adherent to their medication regimens. These solutions are comprised of a variety of tools and aids that may be directly used by a pharmacist or a healthcare provider in their direct care for a patient, or the patient themselves. Healthcare provider systems, institutional pharmacies and retail pharmacies utilize our tools in addition to other clinical services to improve medication adherence in targeted patient populations. The tools include software based systems and medication adherence packaging. 
Our software solutions primarily operate on the Patient Management Access Portal (PMAP), a subscription based software system which provides an environment for patient engagement by clinicians. Services running on PMAP include Time My Meds medication synchronization, immunization management, and a number of tools used by clinicians to manage patient engagement workflows. PMAP integrates to our packaging solutions. Our software solutions also provide integrated voice response for pharmacies, and medication adherence reminders through text, and telephone messaging. In the United Kingdom we offer electronic Medication Administration Records software for use in nursing homes. 
Medication Adherence packaging is designed either for patient use in care environments where there is a caregiver present or for environments where the patient cares for him or herself.    
For environments where a caregiver is present, institutional and retail pharmacies use our solutions for packaging medications into adherence packages that contain a 14 to 90 day supply of a specific single medication. The blister cards may be pre-packaged ahead of time and placed into inventory until needed to fill a specific patient order, or on-demand, where individual patient medication orders are packaged and labeled by an automated robotic system. Our solutions range from manual sealers to fully automated packaging machines, embedded software, as well as the consumable packages used in these machines. We have packaging solutions to help improve patient safety and economics for any size pharmacy operation by increasing pharmacy output and improving dispensing accuracy. 
For environments where a patient cares for him or herself, retail pharmacies use our solutions for packaging medications into adherence packages that contain all of the patient's medications into one seven-day package. These products are primarily used in community-based pharmacies to assist in organizing complex medication regimens into a simple-to-use solution that enhances medication adherence. Multi-medication packages are arranged so that all the medications for a single dosing time are contained in one blister, eliminating confusion for the patient and providing the caregivers increased assurance 
15

that medications are taken in the right sequence. Our solutions include automated packaging machines that package patient specific medications, the software that runs these machines and the consumable packages used in these machines.
In addition to packaging solutions, we sell specially configured versions of our automated dispensing cabinets to institutional pharmacies, which they place in long-term care facilities to manage narcotics, first doses and medications needed quickly.
Single Medication Products for Use Where A Caregiver Is Present
Pharmacy Sealers for Medication Packaging
Our heat-sealed blister cards require a sealer to create an impermeable barrier. By using specially designed equipment to control heat, time and pressure, the institutional pharmacy serving the long-term care patients is able to create a quality seal on every package, providing a secure barrier to moisture and gases. Within this range of equipment is a sealing solution suited for almost any pharmacy, from a low volume manual blister card sealer to a high volume, all-electric heat sealer with programmable computer logic.
Pharmacy Automation Systems
Our semi-automated filling equipment is designed specifically for the long-term care institutional pharmacy with enough order volume to warrant pre-packaging frequently-used medications into blister packs to keep in inventory awaiting a patient order. Our OnDemand automated solutions are designed to meet the broad needs of pharmacies to package individual patient medication orders accurately and efficiently into multiple medication adherence packaging. These machines interface with pharmacy information systems to obtain prescription information to provide patient specific adherence packaging. Our current line of OnDemand machines includes the following products:

• | The MTS-350TM is a tabletop machine capable of prepacking a wide range of medications and features an ergonomic design and easy-to-use controls. The MTS-350 provides a semi-automated mechanism for filling blister cards and a sealer using compressed air and heat.


• | AccuFlex uses robotic technology to accurately and efficiently fill a variety of single-dose medication blister cards on demand.


• | OnDemand Express II optimizes robotic technology for high-speed, accurate fulfillment of single-dose blister cards and reclaimable packaging on demand.


• | Pharmacy labeling is an important part of the packaging process to ensure the right medication is packaged and delivered to the right facility and, ultimately, the right patient. Drug specific, bar code scannable labels are affixed on many different types of packages prior to them being dispensed. We provide a Windows-based computer program that uses an extensive drug image database to produce a wide variety of medication labels on multiple printers. We also provide printers and related consumables. 

Single Medication Blister Cards
We offer a wide variety of heat seal and cold seal blister cards in a variety of configurations, from 14 to 90 day doses. Heat seal cards provide a stronger seal than cold seal cards, helping pharmacists ensure consistency of the medication under nearly any environmental condition. Cold seal cards, also known as pressure sensitive cards, are both efficient and reliable and do not require heat sealing equipment to be sealed. They are ideal for emergency orders, for heat sensitive medications or when the use of a heat sealer is not practical.
MultiMedication Solutions for Use Where Patients Care for Themselves
Pharmacy Automation Systems
Our OnDemand and M-series automated solutions are designed to meet the broad needs of pharmacies to package individual patient medication orders accurately and efficiently into multimed adherence packaging. These machines interface with pharmacy information systems to obtain prescription information to provide patient-specific adherence packaging. Our current line of automation for multimedication includes the following products:

• | M5000 is a fully automated system designed specifically for multi-medication adherence packaging. The M5000 receives patient prescriptions; and constructs a filling map, then uses robotic technology to fill, seal and label the

16

package. The M5000 minimizes human activity in the multi-medication packaging process, thus reducing risk of errors.

• | VBM 200F is an automated pharmacy solution that efficiently and accurately fills and checks Suremed® multiple medication blister cards utilizing guided light, barcode and RFID technologies to allow the filled tray to be audited throughout the entire packing process. VBM 200F can accommodate an extensive formulary with the capacity to store up to 200 different medications in the machine and has the ability to exchange cassettes while it’s running. This technology helps ensure that pharmacies have the competitive advantage to easily scale their business to help improve adherence and patient outcomes. 


• | Guided Packing is a software suite utilized by pharmacists to aid in the process of manually packaging multi-med blister cards. The systems creates the recipe for each patient specific multi-med card, guides the clinician in packaging the card, and produces an integrated label. 

MultiMedication Blister Cards
We offer a wide variety of heat seal and cold seal multi-medication blister cards. Multi-medication cards allow the packaging of multiple drugs into a single blister cavity representing a specific dosing time. Multi-medication cards are sold in a variety of formats to fit the needs of pharmacists and patients, with the most common format providing four dosing times for each of seven days in one package. Multi-medication adherence packages may be assembled by pharmacists by hand, or by using our pharmacy automation systems described above.
Medication Management Solutions
Medication management systems are becoming an integral part of long-term care facilities to manage narcotics, first doses and emergency medications. Currently, most facilities rely on manual systems that do not provide the level of security, accountability and efficiencies that are attainable with the use of automation. When automation is implemented, pharmacies benefit by helping their customer facilities meet regulatory requirements and improve the response time. Patients benefit by having access to medications immediately with minimized medication errors. We offer specialized versions of the OmniRx medication control solution that is used by institutional pharmacies to provide their customers with secure medication management of narcotics, emergency medication, and first doses.
Sales and Distribution
We sell our Automation and Analytics and Medication Adherence solutions primarily in the United States. Approximately 86% of our revenue was generated in this market for the year ended December 31, 2017. No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015. Our sales force is organized by geographic region in the United States and Canada where our sales are primarily made direct to end-user customers with the exception of some distribution of Medication Adherence consumables. Outside the United States and Canada, we field a direct sales force in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and China, and for Medication Adherence products in Australia. For other geographies we generally sell through distributors and resellers. Our foreign operations are discussed in Note 14, Segment and Geographical Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this annual report. Our combined direct, corporate and international distribution sales teams consisted of approximately 276 staff members as of December 31, 2017. Nearly all of our direct sales team members have hospital capital equipment or clinical systems experience. Our sales representatives are generally organized to sell either the Automation and Analytics or Medication Adherence product lines. Our corporate sales team focuses on sales to large IDNs, the U.S. government, as well as partnering with group purchasing organizations ("GPOs").
The sales cycle for our automation systems, from the initial sales meeting to completion of installation, is long and can take in excess of 12 to 22 months. This is due in part to the relative cost of our systems and the number of people within each healthcare facility involved in the purchasing decision. To initiate the selling process, the sales representative generally targets the director of pharmacy, the director of nursing, the director of materials management or other decision makers and is responsible for educating each group within the healthcare facility about the economic safety and compliance benefits of our solutions relative to competing methods of managing medications or medical and surgical supplies.
We contract with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. Pursuant to the terms of GPO agreements, each member contracts directly with us and can purchase our product at pre-negotiated contract terms and pricing. These GPO contracts are typically for multiple years with options to renew or extend for up to two years and some of which can be terminated by either party at any time. Our significant current GPO contracts include Intalere (f.k.a. Amerinet, Inc.), Vizient Inc, Premier Inc., 
17

HealthTrust Purchasing Group, The Resource Group and Resource Optimization & Innovation, LLC. We have also contracted with the U.S. General Services Administration, allowing the Department of Veteran Affairs, the Department of Defense and other Federal Government customers to purchase or lease our products. The account receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 sales to members of the ten largest GPOs accounted for approximately 51% of total consolidated revenue. 
We offer multi-year, non-cancelable lease payment terms to assist healthcare organizations in purchasing our systems by reducing their cash flow requirements. We sell the majority of our multi-year lease receivables to third‑party leasing finance companies, but we also maintain a certain portion of our leases in-house.
Our field operations representatives support our sales force by providing operational and clinical expertise prior to the close of a sale and during installation of our automation systems. This group assists the customer with the technical implementation of our automation systems, including configuring our systems to address the specific needs of each individual customer. After the systems are installed, on-site support is provided by our field service team and technical support group.
We offer telephone technical support through our technical support centers in Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Our support centers are staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We have found that a majority of our customers' service issues can be addressed either over the phone or by our support center personnel using their on-hand remote diagnostics tools. In addition, we use remote dial-in software that monitors customer conditions on a daily basis. We offer a suite of remote monitoring features, which proactively monitors system status and alerts service personnel to potential problems before they lead to system failure.
In addition, our international team handles direct sales, installation and service to healthcare facilities in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, and to non-acute customers in Australia. Sales, installation and service to healthcare facilities is handled through distribution partners in other parts of Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, South Africa, and South America. Our products are available in a variety of languages including Mandarin, French, Swedish, Dutch, Spanish, Turkish and German.
We have not sold and have no future plans to sell our products either directly or indirectly to customers located in countries that are identified as state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. Department of State, or those subject to economic sanctions and export controls.
Centers of Excellence
In 2017, we created Centers of Excellence (“COE”) for product development, engineering and manufacturing with the Point of Use COE located at our facilities in California, the Robotics and Central Pharmacy COE located at our facilities near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and the Medication Adherence Consumables COE located at our facilities in St. Petersburg, Florida. As part of this initiative, we reduced our workforce by approximately 100 full-time employees, or about 4% of our total headcount. This reduction in force included the closure of our Nashville, Tennessee office and our manufacturing facility in Slovenia.
Manufacturing and Inventory
The manufacturing process for our Automation and Analytics products allows us to configure hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer needs. The Automation and Analytics product manufacturing process primarily consists of the final assembly of components and testing of the completed product. Many of the subassemblies and components we use are provided by third-party contract manufacturers or other suppliers. We and our partners test these subassemblies and perform inspections to assure the quality and reliability of our products. While many components of our systems are standardized and available from multiple sources, certain components or subsystems are fabricated by a sole supplier according to our specifications and schedule requirements. Our Medication Adherence product manufacturing process consists of fabrication and assembly of equipment and mechanized process manufacturing of consumables. 
Our arrangements with our contract manufacturers generally set forth quality, cost and delivery requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as continuity of supply, inventory management, capacity flexibility, quality and cost management, oversight of manufacturing and conditions for the use of our intellectual property.
Our manufacturing organization procures components and schedules production based on the backlog of customer orders. Installation of equipment and software typically occurs between two weeks and twelve months after the initial order is received, depending upon the customer's particular needs. We deploy a key operational strategy of operating with backlog levels that approximate the average installation cycle of our customers, which allows us to more efficiently manage our 
18

installation teams, improve production efficiencies, reduce inventory scrap and lower shipping costs. Shipment of consumables typically occurs between one and fourteen days after an order is received.
Competition 
The medication management and supply chain solutions market is intensely competitive. We compete directly with a number of companies and are affected by evolving and new technologies, changes in industry standards and dynamic customer requirements.

Employees 
We had approximately 2,350 employees as of December 31, 2017. We have rebalanced our staff as needed, at times eliminating some functional positions and at other times adding new functional-specific positions to meet the evolving needs of 
20

the business. To our knowledge, none of our domestic employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppage. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Business under Government Contracts
A number of our U.S. government‑owned or government-run hospital customers sign five-year leases, with payment terms that are subject to one-year government budget funding cycles. Failure of any of our U.S. government customers to receive their annual funding could impair our ability to sell to these customers, or to collect payments on our existing unsold leases. For additional information regarding these leases, see the section entitled "Risk Factors" under Part I, Item 1A below.
Financing Practices Relating to Working Capital
We assist healthcare facilities in financing their cash outlay requirements for the purchase of our systems by offering multi-year, non-cancelable sales contracts. For additional information regarding these financing activities, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report.
Product Backlog
Product backlog is the dollar amount of medication and supply dispensing systems for which we have purchase orders from our customers and for which we believe we generally will install, bill and gain customer acceptance within one year. Due to industry practice that allows customers to change order configurations with limited advance notice prior to shipment and occasional customer changes in installation schedules, we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of future sales. However, we do believe that backlog is an indication of a customer's willingness to install our solutions. Our product backlog was $345 million and $301 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.
