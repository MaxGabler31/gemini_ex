 We believe our brand, scale and global reach provide significant competitive advantages and will allow us to continue to capture a growing share of the expanding gaming and streaming market. We believe we can continue to grow by offering market-leading gear 
 2


to gamers, streamers and content creators, expanding the breadth of our product suite to meet the needs of our customers, growing our worldwide market share, continuing to invest in marketing, product innovation and sales, and selectively pursuing accretive acquisitions, such as the eight acquisitions we have completed since 2018.
 Our Industry
 
Since traditional arcade games of the 1970s, gaming has evolved into the mainstream and taken a central place in the global entertainment landscape. According to Activate Research, gaming today represents approximately 11% of all American consumer internet and media activity, surpassing activities such as social media and messaging. Further, based on external market data, in the fourth quarter of 2021, it was estimated that the worldwide gaming community consisted of approximately 1.4 billion casual PC gamers, 125 million regular PC gamers and 24 million PC gaming enthusiasts. We believe this indicates that the majority of the gaming hardware total addressable market is still consumed by a small percentage of gamers, and as a result, there is significant potential opportunity for gaming hardware sales.
 
There are a number of drivers we believe will continue to fuel the gaming market’s expansion. Technology continues to improve game quality. There is increasing availability and variety of high quality, interactive game content as game publishers use cutting-edge game development engines to rapidly create graphically sophisticated and engaging virtual worlds, many of which can support massive multiplayer experiences. Audiences are progressively engaging more with gaming content across platforms and finally, there are decreasing barriers to gaming, where more gamers using mobile devices, and the console and PC platforms represent a natural upgrade path for those seeking a more immersive or competitive gaming environment. 
 
In parallel, digital content creation today has democratized, with content sharing, video-first communication and voice-chat being the norm among creators, viewers and gamers. Gaming content creation and streaming is now ubiquitous, with many active gaming channels on YouTube and live streaming hours watched across Twitch, Mixer, YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming is growing. The proliferation of gaming content is attracting new gamers and increasing the performance focus of existing gamers. Beyond success in gaming, applications for streaming gear are proliferating across use cases including podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, among others. While emerging, these applications represent a promising avenue for continued expansion of the streaming gear market opportunity. 
 
We believe that the growth in gaming and streaming has enhanced demand for our gear by inspiring gamers and creators to reach for the next level of performance and content quality. Competitive gaming rewards speed, precision and reliability. As in other sports, specialized high-performance gear such as gaming mice, keyboards, headsets and performance controllers allow digital athletes to perform at their best. Modern games also require significant processing power to render high-resolution graphics, and reward the speed and precision of user inputs, driving demand for powerful gaming components and systems. Further, in a world where the ability to create content is democratized and competition for viewer engagement is greater than ever, content creators, particularly streamers, are increasingly seeking ways to maximize the quality of their video capture and broadcasting, which requires specialized high-performance gear.
 
Competitive gamer performance needs are being met with specialized gear, such as ultra-precise optical sensors in gaming mice, very low actuation distances in gaming keyboard switches, customizable rear paddles on performance controllers, liquid cooling solutions for high-performance processors and overclocked DRAM modules to process graphically complex games. Similarly, the broadcast quality expected of streamers has increased significantly and a traditional webcam does not produce the professional quality audiences expect of content. Dedicated capture cards are required to record and broadcast video at high resolution, high fidelity microphones are required to ensure clear sound quality, studio lighting and green screens improve production quality, high resolution USB cameras are required to capture smooth and clear images, and dedicated software is required to allow a single-person operation to optimize the streaming experience, preventing lag and fidelity loss. Further, gamers striving for peak performance have heightened requirements for ergonomics and durability, and gamers and streamers often wish to express their personal style or brand with their choice of gear, including a range of appealing design options and opportunities for customization. Finally, gear integration has become an important feature, where gamers and streamers need all of their gear to integrate harmoniously and need the ability to fine-tune that gear, which we believe is an experience best delivered with a software platform that seamlessly integrates and unifies control across devices. Our two proprietary software ecosystems cover the broadest range of gaming peripherals, components and streaming gear, which we believe are unmatched by anything else in the market.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We are a leading global provider and innovator of high-performance gaming gear. We believe that we have a strong position in our target markets, which consist of gamer and creator peripherals, and gaming components and systems markets, as a result of the following competitive strengths:

• | Differentiated software-driven ecosystem. Since our inception, we have concentrated our efforts on helping gamers succeed, which has led us to develop what we believe to be the most complete ecosystem of high-performance gaming gear in the market, which is connected through our iCUE software. We have applied the same ethos to our product development for streaming gear, including the development of streaming software, which helps streamers to optimize their products and maximize their content quality. This includes our Stream Deck software that allows fingertip control of hardware and software.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Global sales and distribution network. We have developed a comprehensive worldwide marketing and distribution network. In this global network, we have established a multichannel sales model and have long-standing relationships with distributors and retailers globally, as well as direct-to-consumer sales channels. We currently ship to more than 85 countries across six continents, with our gear being sold at leading retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, JD.com, MediaMarkt and Walmart. In 2021, sales to the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific represented 44.2%, 38.6% and 17.2%, respectively, of net revenue.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Management team of visionary leaders with deep industry experience and proven ability to execute. We have a strong management team of experienced and talented executives with a track record of execution and deep industry knowledge.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 We intend to grow our business by increasing value to our customers, expanding our market opportunity and further differentiating ourselves from competitors. Key components of our strategy include:

• | Advance as the global leader in high-performance gaming and streaming gear. The gaming and streaming gear category is benefiting from the growing popularity of competitive gaming and streaming, which are driving an increase in gaming and streaming participants as well as spend per participant on high-performance gear. We believe our brand name, high-performance gear and market position will allow us to capture a large share of this market growth and we intend to continue to make significant marketing investments in leading streamers, social media influencers and esports teams.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to develop innovative, market-leading gaming and streaming gear. We intend to prioritize investment in creating innovative gaming and streaming gear and related software to enhance the customer experience by delivering cutting-edge technology. We have an exceptional engineering team, with approximately 25% of employees and contractors working on software solutions. We believe this strong bench of engineering expertise has helped us introduce 141 different products to the market across our categories in 2021, 40 in 2020 and 36 in 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand into new gear and services that grow our market opportunity.

• | Strengthen relationships with end-users by increasing direct-to-consumer sales. Through our acquisitions of Origin and SCUF in 2019, we acquired two companies whose sales are primarily generated through direct-to-consumer channels. Our acquisitions of Gamer Sensei in 2020 and Visuals by Impulse in 2021, both of which have recurring service revenue streams, engage directly with our customer base across our brands. While sales from this channel are a relatively small contributor to our revenue today, we believe direct-to-consumer sales represent a significant avenue to drive growth by facilitating increased market penetration across our product categories. The mix of direct-to-consumer sales represented 10.7%, 8.6% and 2.7% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to grow market share globally. As a globally recognized brand, we have a footprint that reaches customers in more than 85 countries. We will continue to invest in enhancing our sales and distribution infrastructure to expand our leadership position in the Americas and Europe. We view the Asia Pacific region as a long-term growth opportunity and recently invested in our local sales force and regional management to build out distributor networks and retail partnerships.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our brand, software integration and superior product quality to support a pricing premium in the gaming PC components category. In the gaming PC components category, our revenue and margins have benefited from higher pricing versus the rest of the market, which we expect to continue as we invest in our brand and product portfolio. Compared to the average non-Corsair product, our computer cases, cooling solutions, PSUs and high-performance memory commanded price premiums of 24.7%, 20.7%, 29.2% and 43.7%, respectively, in the United States for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, according to recent NPD data.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively pursue complementary acquisitions. We plan to evaluate, and may pursue acquisitions, such as our acquisitions of Elgato, Origin and SCUF, which we believe strengthen our capabilities in existing segments as well as diversify our product offerings, broaden our end-user base or expand our geographic presence.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PC Gaming Software. Our product offering is enhanced by our two proprietary software platforms: iCUE for gamers and Elgato’s streaming suite for streamers and content creators. These software platforms provide unified, intuitive performance, and aesthetic control and customization across their respective product families.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our iCUE software platform powers the full range of our gear from a single intuitive interface, providing advanced performance tuning, user customization and system monitoring. By enabling our customers to fine tune the response of our gaming gear to maximize performance and match their personal preferences and styles of play, we believe that iCUE provides a distinct competitive advantage.
 Product Development
 5


Innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success. Our product development efforts focus on broadening our portfolio with innovative, value-added products that provide gamers with more immersive experiences. This process begins with the initial market analysis and product definition phase, where we use deep knowledge of consumer preferences and feedback to decide the exact specifications of new products desired by our end-users. We then leverage third-party manufacturers and, in some cases, engineering and design firms to help us design, prototype and fabricate our products. We select these third-party partners through a comprehensive selection process and subject them to rigorous quality controls. We perform extensive in-house testing of our products with the latest CPUs and GPUs to ensure optimal performance and compatibility of our products with the most advanced hardware. Our rigorous product development and testing is designed to give us the ability to meet the needs of our end-users consistently with well-designed, high-performance and reliable products. We intend to continue to significantly invest in product development to support the design and development of innovative, high-quality products and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive position.
Marketing
 Our marketing efforts are designed to enhance the Corsair, Elgato, Origin and SCUF brand names, to help us acquire new customers and to increase sales from our existing customers. We have structured our marketing organization to achieve both product- and geography-specific coverage. In addition, our marketing personnel regularly meets with other key industry suppliers such as Intel, AMD, NVIDIA and Asus, in order to ensure that our product development efforts appropriately address the needs of their new products and also to discuss trends and changes in the computer technology market.
 We build awareness of our products and brand through advertising campaigns, public relations efforts, marketing development funds and other financial incentives provided to retailers to promote our products, end-user rebates, online social media outreach, online and in-store promotions and merchandising, our website and other efforts. We believe that our products and brand have also benefited from social media influencers, customer referrals and positive product reviews. We also invest in sponsorships and partnerships with esports events, leagues teams and streaming influencers.
 We benefit from an active computer gaming community whose members communicate with each other through various online social media such as forums, blogs and social networks, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. In addition to forums hosted by third-party domains, we host Corsair-branded forums that are accessible via our website. We actively participate in this community, enabling us to communicate directly with our end customers. Finally, we regularly publish technical and editorial content through various online and print channels and participate in industry trade shows, gaming competitions and other consumer-facing events that provide us with the opportunity to demonstrate our products.
 Sales and Distribution
 Our gear is purchased by gaming enthusiasts worldwide through either our e-tail and retail channel or our direct-to-consumer channel. In our e-tail and retail channel, we distribute our gear either directly to our reseller or through key distributors. While we historically have sold our gear directly to consumers through our website, following our acquisitions of Origin and SCUF Gaming in 2019, the volume of direct-to-consumer sales has increased as both of these companies primarily generated sales through direct-to-consumer channels. We believe direct-to-consumer sales represent a significant avenue to drive growth by facilitating increased market penetration across our product categories.
 We have organized our sales organization into four major geographic regions—Europe (including the Middle East and North Africa), North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific (including South Africa)—and we have local language-speaking sales representatives in the countries that, in the aggregate, generate the majority of our net revenue. We ship our products directly to retailers and distributors and, through distributors, supply our products to thousands of smaller online and brick-and-mortar retailers and to specialist and gaming system integrators and value-added resellers. A small portion of our net revenue is from sales directly to original equipment manufacturers that manufacture gaming PCs.
 In 2021, 2020 and 2019, Amazon accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue, at 26.7%, 24.6% and 25.1%, respectively.
 Production and Operations
 We believe we have developed a global, scalable production and operations infrastructure that allows us to deliver our products cost-effectively and in a timely manner. We operate a facility in Taiwan where we assemble, test, package and ultimately supply nearly all of our DRAM modules and a significant portion of our customized gaming controllers, liquid cooling products and prebuilt gaming systems. We also assemble, test, package and ultimately supply our custom-built PCs in our U.S. facility, and our customized gaming controllers in our U.S. and U.K. facilities. All of the other gear we sell is produced at factories operated by third parties 
 6


located in Asia. In addition, we outsource storage and shipping to several third-party logistics providers around the world which allows us to reduce order fulfillment time, reduce shipping costs and improve inventory flexibility.
 Production of most of our high-speed DRAM modules involves testing and speed sorting of both DRAM ICs and modules and retail packing in our facility in Taoyuan, Taiwan. Our ability to test and sort DRAM modules efficiently enables us to grade them and offer high-performance DRAM modules at higher price points. For standard speed DRAM modules, we also procure assembled modules from approved subcontractors and then test and package them in our Taiwan facility.
 In addition to our production capabilities, our corporate planning process places particular emphasis on driving efficiencies in demand forecasting, supply chain planning, procurement cycle time, freight costs and inventory management. Given the products we sell and the global nature of our business, freight costs can have a significant impact on our expenses, because of this, we have developed a sophisticated forecasting and planning process designed to reduce the cost of transporting our products to our regional distribution hubs and finally, to our customers.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our supply chain consistent with its effect across many industries, including creating shipping and logistics challenges, increasing freight costs significantly, and placing significant limits on component supplies. While we anticipated industry-wide supply chain tightening we took proactive inventory buffering measures in order to position us well during the second half of 2021 and going forward. We will take additional inventory actions as appropriate to align with market demand, and will continue to leverage strong partnerships with our suppliers.
 Seasonality
 Since 2020, our revenue seasonality has been impacted positively and negatively, and thus has not followed historic patterns, by external events, such as shelter-in-place restrictions, global supply chain and logistics issues and availability of affordable GPUs, primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, prior to 2020, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in sales due to the buying patterns of our customers and the spending patterns of gamers. Our net revenue has generally been lower in the first and second calendar quarters due to lower consumer demand following the fourth quarter holiday season and because of the decline in sales that typically occurs in anticipation of the introduction of new or enhanced CPUs and GPUs, which usually take place in the second calendar quarter and which tend to drive sales in the following two quarters. Further, our net revenue tends to be higher in the third and fourth calendar quarter due to seasonal sales such as “Black Friday,” “Cyber Monday” and “Singles Day” in China, as retailers tend to make purchases in advance of these sales. Our sales also tend to be higher in the fourth quarter due to the introduction of new consoles and high-profile games in connection with the holiday season. As a consequence of seasonality, our net revenue for the second calendar quarter is generally the lowest of the year followed by the first calendar quarter. Historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and have been impacted, and may be further impacted in the future, by increasing supply constraints, GPU shortages, shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Competition
 We face intense competition in the markets for all of our products. We operate in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change, constant price pressure, rapid product obsolescence, evolving industry standards and new demands for features and performance. We experience aggressive price competition and other promotional activities by competitors, including in response to declines in consumer demand and excess product supply or as competitors seek to gain market share.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors that affect customer preferences include brand awareness, reputation, breadth and depth of product offering, product performance and quality, design and aesthetics, price, user experience, online product reviews and other value propositions. We believe we compete favorably based on these factors.
 In recent years, we have added new product categories and we intend to continue to introduce new product categories in the future. To the extent we are successful in adding new product categories, we will confront new competitors, many of which may have more experience, better known brands and greater distribution capabilities in the new product categories and markets than we do. In addition, because of the continuing convergence of the markets for computing devices and consumer electronics, we expect greater competition in the future from well-established consumer electronics companies. Many of our current and potential competitors, some of which are large, multi-national businesses, have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, personnel and other resources and greater brand recognition than we have. Our competitors may be in a strong position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market, and sell their products more effectively than we can. In addition, some of our competitors are small or mid-sized specialty companies, which may enable them to react to changes in industry trends or 
 7


consumer preferences or to introduce new or innovative products more quickly than we can. As a result, our product development efforts may not be successful or result in market acceptance of our products.
 Our ability to compete successfully is fundamental to our success in existing and new markets. If we do not compete effectively, demand for our products could decline, our net revenues and gross margin could decrease and we could lose market share, which could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. See the risk factor under the heading “Risks Related to our Business— We face intense competition, and if we do not compete effectively, we could lose market share, demand for our gear could decline and our business may be seriously harmed” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further details and a summary of our key competitors.
 Intellectual Property
 We consider the Corsair brand and its associated sub-brands to be among our most valuable assets. Our future success depends to a large degree upon our ability to defend the Corsair brand and its associated sub-brands from infringement and, to a limited extent, to protect our other intellectual property. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions such as non-disclosure terms to protect our intellectual property. 
 As of December 31, 2021, our worldwide intellectual property portfolio consisted of 291 patents issued and 104 patents pending applications, 431 trademarks issued and 36 trademarks pending applications. We believe that our patents and trademarks and their applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. The expansion of our business has required us to protect our trademarks, domain names, copyrights, and patents and, to the extent that we expand our business into new geographic areas, we may be required to protect our trademarks, domain names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and sometimes requires litigation.
 For a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our future success depends to a large degree upon our ability to defend the Corsair brand and product family brands such as SCUF, Vengeance, K70, Elgato and iCUE from infringement and, if we are unable to protect our brand and other intellectual property, our business may be seriously harmed” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—We are, have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages or royalties and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future” in item 1A.
 Environmental Matters
 Our operations, properties and products are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and waste and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. We believe, based on current information that we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to us. However, our failure to comply with present and future requirements under these laws and regulations, or environmental contamination or releases of hazardous materials on our leased premises, as well as through disposal of our products, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, personal injury and property damage claims, fines and penalties, costs to redesign our products or upgrade our facilities and legal costs, or require us to curtail our operations, any of which could seriously harm our business.
Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 2,490 employees, including temporary employees and dedicated sales and software developer contractors. None of our employees is currently represented by a labor union or is covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to his or her employment. To date we have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
