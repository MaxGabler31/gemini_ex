Item 1. | Business

Overview
Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing novel oncology therapies. We are seeking to translate our unique knowledge of the tumor microenvironment to create therapies that have the potential to improve cancer patient survival. Our research primarily focuses on human enzymes that alter the extracellular matrix and tumor microenvironment. The extracellular matrix is a complex matrix of proteins and carbohydrates surrounding the cell that provides structural support in tissues and orchestrates many important biological activities, including cell migration, signaling and survival. Over many years, we have developed unique technology and scientific expertise enabling us to pursue this target-rich environment for the development of therapies.
Our proprietary enzymes are used to facilitate the delivery of injected drugs and fluids, potentially enhancing the efficacy and the convenience of other drugs or can be used to alter tissue structures for potential clinical benefit. We exploit our technology and expertise using a two pillar strategy that we believe enables us to manage risk and cost by: (1) developing our own proprietary products in therapeutic areas with significant unmet medical needs, with a focus on oncology, and (2) licensing our technology to biopharmaceutical companies to collaboratively develop products that combine our technology with the collaborators’ proprietary compounds.
1

The majority of our approved product and product candidates are based on rHuPH20, our patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme. rHuPH20 is the active ingredient in our first commercially approved product, Hylenex® recombinant, and it works by temporarily breaking down hyaluronan (or HA), a naturally occurring complex carbohydrate that is a major component of the extracellular matrix in tissues throughout the body such as skin and cartilage. We believe this temporary degradation creates an opportunistic window for the improved subcutaneous delivery of injectable biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies and other large therapeutic molecules, as well as small molecules and fluids. We refer to the application of rHuPH20 to facilitate the delivery of other drugs or fluids as our ENHANZE® Technology. We license the ENHANZE Technology to form collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies that develop or market drugs requiring or benefiting from injection via the subcutaneous route of administration.
We currently have ENHANZE collaborations with F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (Roche), Baxalta US Inc. and Baxalta GmbH (Baxalta Incorporated was acquired by Shire plc in June 2016) (Baxalta), Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer), Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), AbbVie, Inc. (AbbVie), Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) and Alexion Pharma Holding (Alexion). We receive royalties from two of these collaborations, including royalties from sales of one product from the Baxalta collaboration and two products from the Roche collaboration. Future potential revenues from the sales and/or royalties of our approved products, product candidates, and ENHANZE collaborations will depend on the ability of Halozyme and our collaborators to develop, manufacture, secure and maintain regulatory approvals for approved products and product candidates and commercialize product candidates.
Our proprietary development pipeline consists primarily of pre-clinical and clinical stage product candidates in oncology. Our lead oncology program is pegvorhyaluronidase alfa (PEGPH20, PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase), a molecular entity we are developing in combination with currently approved cancer therapies as a candidate for the systemic treatment of tumors that accumulate HA. We have demonstrated that when HA accumulates in a tumor, it can cause higher pressure in the tumor, reducing blood flow into the tumor and with that, reduced access of cancer therapies to the tumor. PEGPH20 has been demonstrated in animal models to work by temporarily degrading HA surrounding cancer cells resulting in reduced pressure and increased blood flow to the tumor thereby enabling increased amounts of anticancer treatments administered concomitantly gaining access to the tumor. Through our efforts and efforts of our partners and collaborators, we are currently in Phase 3 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with ABRAXANE® (nab-paclitaxel) and gemcitabine in stage IV pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“PDA”) (HALO 109-301), in Phase 1b clinical testing for PEGPH20 with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer (HALO 107-101), in Phase 1b/2 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with HALAVEN® (eribulin) in patients treated with up to two lines of prior therapy for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, in Phase 1b/2 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in patients with previously treated metastatic PDA, in Phase 1b/2 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with Tecentriq in patients with gastric cancer and in Phase 1b/2 clinical testing for PEGPH20 with Tecentriq in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gall bladder cancer (HALO 110-101/MATRIX).

Technology
rHuPH20 can be applied as a drug delivery platform to increase dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs and fluids that are injected under the skin or in the muscle thereby potentially enhancing efficacy or convenience. For example, rHuPH20 has been used to convert drugs that must be delivered intravenously into subcutaneous injections or to reduce the number of subcutaneous injections needed for effective therapy. When ENHANZE Technology is applied subcutaneously, the rHuPH20 acts locally and has a tissue half-life of less than 15 minutes. HA at the local site reconstitutes its normal density within a few days and, therefore, we anticipate that any effect of rHuPH20 on the architecture of the subcutaneous space is temporary. 
2

Additionally, we are expanding our scientific work to develop other enzymes and agents that target the extracellular matrix’s unique aspects, giving rise to potentially new molecular entities with a particular focus on oncology. We are developing a PEGylated version of the rHuPH20 enzyme (PEGPH20), that lasts for an extended period in the bloodstream (half-life of one to two days), and may therefore better target solid tumors that accumulate HA by degrading the surrounding HA and reducing the interstitial fluid pressure within malignant tumors to allow better penetration by co-administered agents. 
Strategy
During 2017, we continued our strategy of focusing on developing our oncology pipeline and expanding our collaborations for ENHANZE Technology. This business model allows for revenue garnered from collaboration products to help fund our investment in PEGPH20 clinical development, with the goal of a future product approval that will support sustained growth.
Key aspects of our corporate strategy include the following:

• | Focus on our oncology pipeline. We are currently developing PEGPH20, our investigational new drug candidate, in multiple different tumors that accumulate high levels of HA. PEGPH20 is in Phase 3 development in stage IV PDA and multiple Phase 1b/2 studies for various tumor types. Over time, it is our goal to study additional types of cancer and to advance this program toward regulatory approval and commercial launch. In addition, we have a novel oncology preclinical asset.


• | Focus on our ENHANZE platform. We currently have eight collaborations with three current product approvals and additional product candidates in development. We intend to work with our existing collaborators to expand our collaborations to add new targets and develop targets and product candidates under the terms of the operative agreements. In addition, we will continue our efforts to enter into new collaborations to further derive additional value from our proprietary technology.

Product and Product Candidates
We have one marketed proprietary product, three partnered products, one proprietary product candidate targeting several indications in various stages of development, and one preclinical product candidate. The following table summarizes our proprietary product and product candidate as well as products and product candidates under development with our collaborators:

Proprietary Pipeline
Hylenex Recombinant (hyaluronidase human injection)
Hylenex recombinant is a formulation of rHuPH20 that has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to facilitate subcutaneous fluid administration for achieving hydration, to increase the dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs and, in subcutaneous urography, to improve resorption of radiopaque agents. Hylenex recombinant is currently the number one prescribed branded hyaluronidase. 
PEGPH20 
We are developing PEGPH20 in combination with currently approved cancer therapies as a candidate for the systemic treatment of tumors that accumulate HA. ‘PEG’ refers to the attachment of polyethylene glycol to rHuPH20, thereby creating PEGPH20. One of the novel properties of PEGPH20 is that it lasts for an extended duration in the bloodstream and, therefore, can be administered systemically to maintain its therapeutic effect to treat disease.
Cancer malignancies, including pancreatic, lung, breast, gastric, and biliary tract cancers can accumulate high levels of HA and therefore we believe that PEGPH20 has the potential to help patients with these types of cancer when used with certain currently approved cancer therapies. Among solid tumors, PDA has been reported to be associated with the highest frequency of HA accumulation. There are approximately 65,000 annual diagnoses of PDA in the United States and the European Union, and we estimate that 35-40% have high levels of HA. 
5

The pathologic accumulation of HA, along with other matrix components, creates a unique microenvironment for the growth of tumor cells compared to normal cells. We believe that degrading the HA component of the tumor microenvironment with PEGPH20 remodels the tumor microenvironment, resulting in tumor growth inhibition in animal models. Removal of HA from the tumor microenvironment results in expansion of previously constricted blood vessels allowing increased blood flow, potentially increasing the access of activated immune cells and factors in the blood into the tumor microenvironment. If PEGPH20 is administered in conjunction with other anti-cancer therapies, the increase in blood flow may allow anti-cancer therapies to have greater access to the tumor, which may enhance the treatment effect of therapeutic modalities like chemotherapies, monoclonal antibodies and other agents.
We are developing PEGPH20 as a targeted therapy, for patients who have tumors with high levels of HA. We have a collaboration with Ventana Medical Systems Inc. (Ventana), a member of the Roche Group, to develop, and for Ventana to ultimately commercialize, a companion diagnostic assay for use with PEGPH20. The companion diagnostic assay is being used to identify high levels of HA in tumor biopsies, and may be the first diagnostic to target tumor-associated HA and possibly the first companion diagnostic assay in pancreatic cancer. 
Pancreatic cancer indications:
HALO 109-201:
In January 2015, we presented the final results from HALO 109-201, a multi-center, international open label dose escalation Phase 1b clinical study of PEGPH20 in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with stage IV PDA at the 2015 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (also known as ASCO-GI meeting). This study enrolled 28 patients with previously untreated stage IV PDA. Patients were treated with one of three doses of PEGPH20 (1.0, 1.6 and 3.0 µg/kg twice weekly for four weeks, then weekly thereafter) in combination with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 administered intravenously. In this study, the confirmed overall response rate (complete response + partial response confirmed on a second scan as assessed by an independent radiology review) was 29 percent (7 of 24 patients) for those treated at therapeutic dose levels of PEGPH20 (1.6 and 3.0 µg/kg). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 154 days (95% CI, 50-166) in the efficacy-evaluable population (n = 24). Among efficacy-evaluable patients with baseline tumor HA staining (n = 17), the median PFS in patients with high baseline tumor HA staining (6/17 patients) was substantially longer, 219 days, than in the patients with low baseline tumor HA staining (11/17 patients), 108 days. Median overall survival (OS) was 200 days (95% CI, 123-370) in the efficacy-evaluable population (n = 24). Among efficacy-evaluable patients with baseline tumor HA staining (n = 17), the median OS in patients with high baseline tumor HA staining (6/17 patients) was substantially longer, 395 days, than in the patients with low baseline tumor HA staining (11/17 patients), 174 days. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (occurring in ≥ 15% of patients) were peripheral edema, muscle spasms, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, myalgia, anemia, and nausea. Thromboembolic (TE) events were reported in 8 patients (28.6%) and musculoskeletal events were reported in 21 patients (75%) which were generally grade 1/2 in severity.
HALO 109-202:
In the second quarter of 2013, we initiated HALO 109-202 (HALO-202), a Phase 2 multicenter randomized clinical trial evaluating PEGPH20 as a first-line therapy for patients with stage IV PDA. The study was designed to enroll patients who would receive gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (ABRAXANE®) either with or without PEGPH20. The primary endpoint is to measure the improvement in PFS in patients receiving PEGPH20 plus gemcitabine and ABRAXANE (PAG arm) compared to those who are receiving gemcitabine and ABRAXANE alone (AG arm). In April 2014, after 146 patients had been enrolled, the trial was put on clinical hold by Halozyme and the FDA to assess a question raised by the Data Monitoring Committee regarding a possible difference in the TE events rate between the group of patients treated in the PAG arm versus the group of patients treated in the AG arm. This portion of the study and patients in this portion are now referred to as Stage 1. At the time of the clinical hold all patients remaining in the study continued on gemcitabine and ABRAXANE. In July 2014, HALO-202 was reinitiated (Stage 2) under a revised protocol, which excludes patients that are expected to be at a greater risk for TE events. The revised protocol provides for thromboembolism prophylaxis of all patients in both arms of the study with low molecular weight heparin, and adds evaluation of the TE events rate in Stage 2 PEGPH20-treated patients as a co-primary end point. Stage 2 of HALO-202 enrolled an additional 133 patients, to add to the 146 patients already in the clinical trial, with a 2:1 randomization for the PAG arm compared to the AG arm.

In March 2016, our partner Ventana received approval for an investigational device exemption (IDE) application from the FDA for our companion diagnostic test to enable patient selection in our Phase 3 Study HALO-301 of PEGPH20 in HA-High patients. Based on the cutpoint for the Ventana diagnostic, we expect approximately 35 to 40 percent of stage IV PDA patients to have HA-High tumors, similar to the previously reported interim results from Stage 1 of Study HALO-202 using the Halozyme prototype assay.
In January 2017, we announced topline results from the combined analysis of Stage 1 and Stage 2, and Stage 2 alone, based on a December 2016 data cutoff. The combined analysis included 135 treated patients in Stage 1, of whom a total of 45 patients (24 in the PAG arm and 21 in the AG arm) were determined to have high HA, and 125 treated patients in Stage 2, of whom a total of 35 patients (24 in the PAG arm and 11 in the AG arm) were determined to have high HA. This analysis of secondary and exploratory endpoints was conducted using the Ventana companion diagnostic to prospectively identify high levels of HA. The key results showed in the combined Stage 1 and Stage 2 dataset:

• | The primary endpoint of PFS in the efficacy evaluable population (total of 231 patients) was met with statistical significance with a median PFS of 6.0 months in the PAG arm compared to 5.3 months in the AG arm, hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 (0.53, 1.00); p=0.048; 


• | The secondary endpoint of PFS in the HA-High intent to treat population (total of 84 HA-High patients) was met with statistical significance with a median PFS of 9.2 months in the PAG arm compared to 5.2 months in the AG arm, HR 0.51 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.00); p=0.048; 


• | The exploratory analysis of median OS was 11.5 months vs. 8.5 months in the PAG vs. AG arms, respectively. Factors potentially having an impact on these results include less aggressive disease among patients in the AG arm within the Stage 1 patient population, and 9 of the 24 patients in the PAG arm (approximately 40 percent) discontinued PEGPH20 treatment at the time of the clinical hold, resulting in many patients receiving AG alone in both arms.

In the Stage 2 cohort population, in a total of 35 HA-High patients, the key results showed:

• | Median PFS was 8.6 months in the PAG arm compared to 4.5 months in the AG arm, hazard ratio of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.21, 1.93); 


• | Median overall survival (OS) was 11.7 months in the PAG arm compared to 7.8 months in the AG arm, hazard ratio of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.22, 1.23); 


• | The primary safety endpoint of decreasing the rate of TE events in Stage 2 was also met with the rate of TE events reducing from 43 percent to 10 percent in the PAG arm and from 25 percent to 6 percent in the AG arm, following a protocol amendment that excluded patients at high risk of TE events and with the introduction of prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) in Stage 2 of the study with the current 1mg/kg/day dose of enoxaparin prophylaxis given in both treatment arms of the study.

In June 2017, results from Study HALO-202 were presented at the ESMO World Congress of Gastrointestinal Cancer and the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). HALO-202 is an ongoing study with an open database, and has completed enrollment. We continue to collect and receive data on both Stage 1 and Stage 2 patients. When the database is considered complete and locked, an updated analysis and Final Study Report will be generated.
HALO 109-301:
In March 2015, we met with the FDA to discuss both the interim efficacy and safety data from HALO-202, which included the potential risk profile including TE event rate. Based on the feedback from that meeting, we proceeded with HALO 109-301 (HALO-301), a Phase 3 clinical study of PEGPH20 in patients with stage IV PDA, using a design allowing for potential marketing application based on PFS (accelerated approval pathway) or OS. The study will enroll patients whose tumors accumulate high levels of HA measured using the Ventana companion diagnostic test. The FDA provided feedback on the current companion diagnostic approach and confirmed that an approved IDE is required for the Phase 3 study.

The use of PFS as the basis for marketing approval will be subject to the overall benefit and risk associated with PEGPH20 combined with gemcitabine and ABRAXANE therapy, including the:

• | Magnitude of the PFS treatment effect observed;


• | Toxicity profile; and


• | Interim OS data.

In June 2015, we received scientific advice/protocol assistance from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding our Phase 3 study. The EMA agreed to the patient population, and the use of both PFS and OS as co-primary endpoints stating that OS is the preferred endpoint and that ultimate approval would require an overall positive benefit:risk balance.
In March 2016, we dosed the first patient in HALO-301, a Phase 3 multicenter randomized clinical trial evaluating PEGPH20 as a first-line therapy for patients with stage IV PDA. The study will evaluate the effects on PFS and OS of PEGPH20 with gemcitabine and ABRAXANE compared with gemcitabine and ABRAXANE alone in stage IV PDA patients. In September 2017, our independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee met to review ongoing safety data from the trial and informed us the study should proceed as planned. Approximately 235 sites in 22 countries located in North America, Europe, South America and Asia have been initiated to participate in the HALO-301 study. An interim analysis will be conducted for our first primary endpoint when we achieve the target number of PFS events. We project that the target number of PFS events will be achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018. At that time we project we will have enrolled approximately 500 patients. 
SWOG Study S1313:
In October 2013, SWOG, a cancer research cooperative group of more than 4,000 researchers in over 500 institutions around the world, initiated a 144 patient Phase 1b/2 randomized clinical trial in some of their study centers, examining PEGPH20 in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy compared to modified FOLFIRINOX treatment alone in patients with stage IV PDA (funded by the National Cancer Institute). As announced in March 2017, SWOG stopped enrollment in the Phase 1b/2 trial. While PEGPH20 is a targeted investigational therapy for patients with high levels of HA, the SWOG study was enrolling patients irrespective of HA levels, referred to as an all-comer population. During a planned early futility analysis, SWOG’s independent Data Monitoring Committee found, based on preliminary data, that the addition of PEGPH20 given every two weeks to modified FOLFIRINOX in this all-comer population would be unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of overall survival. SWOG further reported that a higher rate of death was observed in the PEGPH20 arm versus modified FOLFIRINOX alone. SWOG has stopped the study and continues its ongoing effort to collect and clean outstanding data. In January 2018, SWOG presented final data of the all-comers population at the ASCO-GI conference. The median overall survival was 7.7 months for the PEGPH20 arm vs. 14.4 months in the modified FOLFIRINOX alone arm. Also, increased GI-toxicities and substantially shorter median treatment duration for modified FOLFIRINOX were reported for the PEGPH20 arm compared to the modified FOLFIRINOX alone arm. Collection of biopsy samples from participating sites, to the extent available, is ongoing to potentially enable an HA biomarker subgroup analysis. Our PEGPH20 studies and clinical collaborations in combination with agents other than modified FOLFIRINOX continue unchanged.
Clinical collaboration:
In October 2016, we announced that PEGPH20 will be included in a pancreatic cancer clinical trial initiative called Precision Promise, an initiative that aims to change the current treatment approach to pancreatic cancer by offering options to patients based on the molecular profile of their tumor. This is being accomplished through the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network leading a collaboration that brings together clinicians, researchers, and drug developers. Pancreatic Cancer Action Network continues to work to finalize the trial design and protocol which is expected to include a potential PEGPH20 trial arm or trial in 2019.
Other indications outside of pancreatic cancer:
HALO 107-101:
In November 2015, we initiated a Phase 1b study exploring the combination of PEGPH20 and KEYTRUDA®, an immuno-oncology agent in relapsed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and gastric cancer. In December 2016, we identified a dose of PEGPH20, namely 2.2 ug/kg, to move into the dose expansion phase of the study with KEYTRUDA in combination with PEGPH20. We are enrolling both NSCLC and gastric cancer patients prospectively based on a patient being determined to be HA-High using 
8

the Ventana companion diagnostic test. In September 2017, our standing Independent Data Monitoring Safety Committee met to review ongoing safety data from the trial and informed us that the study should proceed with study protocol modifications to exclude patients at risk and increase liver safety monitoring, after observing clinical and laboratory signs of hepato-biliary dysfunction.
Clinical collaborations:
In July 2015, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai) to evaluate Eisai's HALAVEN® (eribulin) with PEGPH20 in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. In July 2016, the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1b/2 study for patients treated with up to two lines of prior therapy for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. In January 2018, the Phase 1b portion of the study closed enrollment. As a result of an Eisai portfolio decision, no further clinical development is planned on the Phase 2 portion of this study. Data analysis is ongoing and a submission of the results of this study to a scientific forum is expected in the second half of 2018. Halozyme and Eisai jointly share the costs to conduct this global study.
In November 2016, we entered into an agreement with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, to collaborate on clinical studies to evaluate their cancer immunotherapy Tecentriq, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, in combination with PEGPH20, in up to eight different tumor types. Genentech initiated a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with previously treated metastatic PDA in July 2017 and a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with gastric cancer in October 2017, as part of its Morpheus master protocol. We will supply PEGPH20 for the Genentech-funded studies. In October 2017, we initiated a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to assess Tecentriq with PEGPH20 in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gall bladder cancer (HALO 110-101/MATRIX). Genentech will supply Tecentriq for the Halozyme sponsored study. 
Regulatory
The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for our program investigating PEGPH20 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with stage IV PDA to demonstrate an improvement in OS. The Fast Track designation process was developed by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and address unmet medical needs.
The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation for PEGPH20 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The FDA Office of Orphan Products Development’s mission is to advance the evaluation and development of products (drugs, biologics, devices, or medical foods) that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and/or treatment of rare diseases or conditions. Similarly, the European Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the EMA designated PEGPH20 an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
Other Pipeline Assets 
HTI-1511: HTI-1511 is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to treat solid tumors, including those with drug-resistant mutations. At this time, we have discontinued further development of this program. 
PEG-ADA2: PEGylated adenosine deaminase 2, or PEG-ADA2, is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets adenosine, which may accumulate to high levels in the tumor microenvironment and has been linked to immunosuppression. We are currently in preclinical development with PEG-ADA2 and are exploring potential collaboration or partnership interest in this program prior to making additional investments in the development of PEG-ADA2. 
ENHANZE Collaborations
Roche Collaboration
In December 2006, we and Roche entered into a collaboration and license agreement under which Roche obtained a worldwide license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rHuPH20 and up to thirteen Roche target compounds (the Roche Collaboration). Roche initially had the exclusive right to apply rHuPH20 to three pre-defined Roche biologic targets with the option to develop and commercialize rHuPH20 with ten additional targets. Roche had the right to exercise this option to identify additional targets for ten years. As of the ten year anniversary of the Roche Collaboration in December 2016, Roche had elected a total of eight targets, two of which are exclusive. 
9

In September 2013, Roche launched a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of Herceptin (trastuzumab) (Herceptin SC) in Europe for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. This formulation utilizes our patented ENHANZE Technology and is administered in two to five minutes, compared to 30 to 90 minutes with the standard intravenous form. Roche received European marketing approval for Herceptin SC in August 2013. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. HER2-positive cancer is reported to be a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer. Directed at the same target, Roche initiated a Phase 1 study of rHuPH20 with PERJETA® (pertuzumab) in patients with early breast cancer in March 2016. 
In June 2014, Roche launched MabThera SC in Europe for the treatment of patients with common forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). This formulation utilizes our patented ENHANZE Technology and is administered in approximately five minutes compared to the approximately 1.5 to 4 hour infusion time for intravenous MabThera. The European Commission approved MabThera SC in March 2014. In May 2016, Roche announced that the EMA approved Mabthera SC to treat patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In June 2017, the FDA approved Genentech’s (a member of the Roche Group) RITUXAN HYCELA™, a combination of rituximab and rHuPH20 (approved and marketed under the MabThera SC brand in countries outside the U.S.), for CLL and two types of NHL, follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
In September 2017, we and Roche entered into an agreement providing Roche the right to develop and commercialize one additional exclusive target using our ENHANZE Technology (the 2017 Roche Collaboration). The upfront license payment may be followed by event-based payments subject to Roche’s achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. In addition, Roche will pay royalties to us if products under the collaboration are commercialized.
In January 2018, Roche initiated a Phase 1 study of an undisclosed target with ENHANZE Technology. 
Baxalta Collaboration
In September 2007, we and Baxalta entered into a collaboration and license agreement under which Baxalta obtained a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rHuPH20 with GAMMAGARD LIQUID (HYQVIA) (the Baxalta Collaboration). HYQVIA is indicated for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency disorders associated with defects in the immune system.
In May 2013, the European Commission granted Baxalta marketing authorization in all EU Member States for the use of HYQVIA (solution for subcutaneous use) as replacement therapy for adult patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. Baxalta launched HYQVIA in the first EU country in July 2013 and has continued to launch in additional countries.
In September 2014, HYQVIA was approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with primary immunodeficiency in the U.S. HYQVIA is the first subcutaneous immune globulin (IG) treatment approved for adult primary immunodeficiency patients with a dosing regimen requiring only one infusion up to once per month (every three to four weeks) and one injection site per infusion in most patients, to deliver a full therapeutic dose of IG. Prior to the approval of HYQVIA, the majority of primary immunodeficiency patients received intravenous infusions in a doctor’s office or infusion center, and other subcutaneous IG treatments require weekly or bi-weekly treatment with multiple infusion sites per treatment. The FDA’s approval of HYQVIA was a significant milestone for us as it represented the first U.S. approved BLA which utilizes our rHuPH20 platform. 
In May 2016, Baxalta announced that HYQVIA received a marketing authorization from the European Commission for a pediatric indication, which is being launched in Europe to treat primary and certain secondary immunodeficiencies. 
Pfizer Collaboration
In December 2012, we and Pfizer entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Pfizer has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Pfizer proprietary biologics directed to up to six targets in primary care and specialty care indications. Targets may be selected on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. Pfizer has elected five targets on an exclusive basis and returned two targets. 
10

Janssen Collaboration
In December 2014, we and Janssen entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Janssen has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Janssen proprietary biologics directed to up to five targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis. Janssen has elected CD38 as the first target on an exclusive basis. In November 2015, Janssen initiated dosing in a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating subcutaneous delivery of DARZALEX (daratumumab), directed at CD38, using ENHANZE Technology, in multiple myeloma patients. In December 2016, Janssen announced results of the trial, which supported continued development of daratumumab with rHuPH20. In December 2017, Janssen announced data which demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of DARZALEX and rHuPH20 was well-tolerated, with rates of infusion reactions lower than those observed with IV administration of DARZALEX. Janssen has initiated four Phase 3 studies and one Phase 1 study of daratumumab combined with the ENHANZE Technology in patients with Amyloidosis, Smoldering Myeloma and Multiple Myeloma. A Phase 2 study of daratumumab combined with the ENHANZE Technology is planned in 2018 for patients with multiple myeloma. 
AbbVie Collaboration
In June 2015, we and AbbVie entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which AbbVie has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with AbbVie proprietary biologics directed to up to nine targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis. AbbVie elected one target on an exclusive basis, TNF alpha, for which it has discontinued development and returned the target.
Lilly Collaboration
In December 2015, we and Lilly entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Lilly has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Lilly proprietary biologics directed to up to five targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis. Lilly has elected two targets on an exclusive basis and one target on a semi-exclusive basis. In August 2017, Lilly initiated a Phase 1 study of an investigational new therapy in combination with rHuPH20.
BMS Collaboration
In September 2017, we and BMS entered into a collaboration and license agreement, which became effective in November 2017, under which BMS has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with BMS immuno-oncology targets directed at up to eleven targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis, with the exception of one co-exclusive target. BMS has designated multiple immuno-oncology targets including programmed death 1 (PD-1) and has an option to select additional targets within five years from the effective date.
Alexion Collaboration
In December 2017, we and Alexion entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Alexion has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Alexion’s portfolio of products directed at up to four targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis. Alexion elected two targets on an exclusive basis, including a C5 complement inhibitor and has an option to select two additional targets within five years from the effective date. Alexion plans to initiate a Phase 1 trial in 2018 to study a next-generation subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1210 (ALXN1210 SC) with ENHANZE.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our inventions, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Our strategy is to actively pursue patent protection in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions for technology that we believe to be proprietary to us and that offers us a potential competitive advantage. Our patent portfolio includes 33 issued patents in the U.S., more than 370 issued patents in Europe and other countries in the world and more than 170 pending patent applications. In general, patents have a term of 20 years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date. Our issued patents will expire between 2022 and 2032. We have multiple patents and patent applications throughout the world pertaining to our recombinant human hyaluronidase and methods of use and manufacture, including an issued U.S. patent which expires in 2027 and an issued European patent which expires in 2024, which we believe cover the products and product candidates under our existing collaborations, Hylenex recombinant, PEGPH20 and our endocrinology product candidates. In addition, we have, under prosecution throughout the world, multiple patent applications that relate specifically to individual product candidates under development, the expiration of which can only be definitely determined upon maturation into our issued patents. We believe our patent filings represent a barrier to entry for potential competitors looking to utilize these hyaluronidases.
In addition to patents, we rely on unpatented trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. Our policy is to require our employees, directors, consultants, advisors, collaborators, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, other advisors and other individuals and entities to execute confidentiality agreements upon the start of employment, consulting or other contractual relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the relationship is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and some other parties, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual will be our exclusive property. Despite the use of these agreements and our efforts to protect our intellectual property, there will always be a risk of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors.
We also file trademark applications to protect the names of our products and product candidates. These applications may not mature to registration and may be challenged by third parties. We are pursuing trademark protection in a number of different countries around the world. There can be no assurances that our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names will not infringe on rights of third parties or will be acceptable to regulatory agencies.

Research and Development Activities
Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the development and manufacturing of our product candidates, compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel, supplies and materials, costs for consultants and related contract research, clinical trials, facility costs and amortization and depreciation. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred. Our research and development activities are primarily focused on the development of our various product candidates.
Due to the uncertainty in obtaining the FDA and other regulatory approvals, our reliance on third parties and competitive pressures, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the additional costs we will incur in the continued development of our proprietary product candidates for commercialization. However, we expect our research and development expenses for PEGPH20 to increase as our program advances into additional tumors and later stages of clinical development.
Manufacturing
We do not have our own manufacturing facility for our product and product candidates, or the capability to package our products. We have engaged third parties to manufacture bulk rHuPH20, PEGPH20 and Hylenex recombinant.
We have existing supply agreements with contract manufacturing organizations Avid Bioservices, Inc. (Avid) and Catalent Indiana LLC (formerly Cook Pharmica LLC) (Catalent) to produce supplies of bulk rHuPH20. These manufacturers each produce bulk rHuPH20 under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) for clinical and commercial uses. Catalent currently produces bulk rHuPH20 for use in Hylenex recombinant, product candidates and collaboration product candidates. Avid currently produces bulk rHuPH20 for use in collaboration products. We rely on their ability to successfully manufacture these batches according to product specifications. In addition, we validated and qualified a new facility operated by Avid as a manufacturer of bulk rHuPH20 for use in the products and product candidates under the Roche Collaboration. It is important for our business for Catalent and Avid to (i) retain their status as cGMP-approved manufacturing facilities; (ii) successfully scale up bulk rHuPH20 production; and/or (iii) manufacture the bulk rHuPH20 required by us and our collaborators for use in our proprietary and collaboration products and product candidates. In addition to supply obligations, Avid and Catalent will also provide support for data and information used in the chemistry, manufacturing and controls sections for FDA and other regulatory filings.
We have a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Patheon Manufacturing Services, LLC (Patheon) under which Patheon will provide the final fill and finishing steps in the production process of Hylenex recombinant. Under our commercial services agreement with Patheon, Patheon has agreed to fill and finish Hylenex recombinant product for us until December 31, 2019, subject to further extensions in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In addition, we scaled up our manufacturing of PEGPH20 with third party suppliers to support additional clinical trials, including the Phase 3 trial, and ultimately, if approved, potential commercial supply.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Hylenex Recombinant
Our commercial activities currently focus on Hylenex recombinant. We have a team of sales specialists that provide hospital and surgery center customers with the information about Hylenex recombinant and information needed to obtain formulary approval for, and support utilization of, Hylenex recombinant. Our commercial activities also include marketing and related services and commercial support services such as commercial operations, managed markets and commercial analytics. We also employ third-party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support related services to assist with our commercial activities.
We sell Hylenex recombinant in the U.S. to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, who sell the product to hospitals and other end-user customers. We engage Integrated Commercialization Solutions (ICS), a division of AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen, to act as our exclusive distributor for commercial shipment and distribution of Hylenex recombinant to our customers in the United States. In addition to distribution services, ICS provides us with other key services related to logistics, warehousing, returns and inventory management, contract administration and chargebacks processing and accounts receivable management. In addition, we utilize third parties to perform various other services for us relating to regulatory 
13

monitoring, including call center management, adverse event reporting, safety database management and other product maintenance services.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our product or product candidates, including large pharmaceutical companies, smaller pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, drug development experience, sales and marketing capabilities, including larger, well established sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than us. We face competition not only in the commercialization of Hylenex recombinant, but also for the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates, and the out-licensing of our ENHANZE Technology. In addition, our collaborators face competition in the commercialization of the product candidates for which the collaborators seek marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities.
Hylenex Recombinant
Hylenex recombinant is currently the only FDA approved recombinant human hyaluronidase on the market. The competitors for Hylenex recombinant include, but are not limited to, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.’s product, Vitrase®, an ovine (ram) hyaluronidase, and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s product, Amphadase®, a bovine (bull) hyaluronidase. In addition, some commercial pharmacies compound hyaluronidase preparations for institutions and physicians even though compounded preparations are not FDA approved products.
Government Regulations
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries regulate the manufacture and sale of the pharmaceutical products that we have developed or currently are developing. The FDA has established guidelines and safety standards that are applicable to the laboratory and preclinical evaluation and clinical investigation of therapeutic products and stringent regulations that govern the manufacture and sale of these products. The process of obtaining regulatory approval for a new therapeutic product usually requires a significant amount of time and substantial resources. The steps typically required before a product can be introduced for human use include:

• | animal pharmacology studies to obtain preliminary information on the safety and efficacy of a drug; or


• | laboratory and preclinical evaluation in vitro and in vivo including extensive toxicology studies.

The results of these laboratory and preclinical studies may be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The sponsor of an IND application may commence human testing of the compound 30 days after submission of the IND, unless notified to the contrary by the FDA.
The clinical testing program for a new drug typically involves three phases:

• | Phase 1 investigations are generally conducted in healthy subjects (in certain instances, Phase 1 studies that determine the maximum tolerated dose and initial safety of the product candidate are performed in patients with the disease);


• | Phase 2 studies are conducted in limited numbers of subjects with the disease or condition to be treated and are aimed at determining the most effective dose and schedule of administration, evaluating both safety and whether the product demonstrates therapeutic effectiveness against the disease; and


• | Phase 3 studies involve large, well-controlled investigations in diseased subjects and are aimed at verifying the safety and effectiveness of the drug.

14

Data from all clinical studies, as well as all laboratory and preclinical studies and evidence of product quality, are typically submitted to the FDA in a new drug application (NDA). The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a biologic product candidate are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA, for evaluation to determine whether the product candidate may be approved for commercial sale. In responding to a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval or request additional information. If additional information is requested we may provide such information or withdraw our application. Although the FDA’s requirements for clinical trials are well established and we believe that we have planned and conducted our clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations and guidelines, these requirements may be subject to change. Accordingly, we could be required to conduct additional trials beyond what we had planned due to the FDA’s safety and/or efficacy concerns or due to differing interpretations of the meaning of our clinical data or a change in the therapeutic landscape. (See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.)
The FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research must approve an NDA and the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research must approve a BLA for a drug before it may be marketed in the United States. If we begin to market our proposed products for commercial sale in the U.S., any manufacturing operations that may be established in or outside the U.S. will also be subject to rigorous regulation, including compliance with cGMP. We also may be subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, the Export Control Act and other present and future laws of general application. In addition, the handling, care and use of laboratory animals are subject to the Guidelines for the Humane Use and Care of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health.
Regulatory obligations continue post-approval, and include the reporting of adverse events when a drug is utilized in the broader patient population. Promotion and marketing of drugs is also strictly regulated, with penalties imposed for violations of FDA regulations, the Lanham Act and other federal and state laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute.
We currently intend to continue to seek, directly or through our collaborators, approval to market our products and product candidates in foreign countries, which may have regulatory processes that differ materially from those of the FDA. We anticipate that we will rely upon independent consultants to seek and gain approvals to market our proposed products in foreign countries or may rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to license our proposed products. We cannot guarantee that approvals to market any of our proposed products can be obtained in any country. Approval to market a product in any one foreign country does not necessarily indicate that approval can be obtained in other countries.
From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of drug products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or reviewing courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and development of our product candidates and any products that we may commercialize. It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, or what the impact of any such changes may be.
Segment Information
We operate our business as one segment, which includes all activities related to the research, development and commercialization of human enzymes and other drug candidates. This segment also includes revenues and expenses related to (i) research and development activities conducted under our collaboration agreements with third parties and (ii) product sales of Hylenex recombinant. The chief operating decision-maker reviews the operating results on an aggregate basis and manages the operations as a single operating segment. Our long-lived assets located in foreign countries had minimal book value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.
