Item 1. Business
Company Overview and History
GMS Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “we,” “our,” “us,” “GMS” or the “Company”), through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, operates a network of nearly 300 distribution centers with extensive product offerings of wallboard, ceilings, steel framing and complementary construction products. We also operate nearly 100 tool sales, rental and service centers. Through these operations, we provide a comprehensive selection of building products and solutions for our residential and commercial contractor customer base across the United States and Canada. Our unique operating model combines the benefits of a national platform and strategy with a local go-to-market focus, enabling us to generate significant economies of scale while maintaining high levels of customer service.
Since our founding in 1971, we have grown our business from a single location to nearly 300 branches across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces through a combination of strategic acquisitions, opening new branches (“greenfields”) and organic growth. Underpinning that growth is our entrepreneurial culture, which both enables us to drive organic growth by delivering outstanding customer service and makes us an attractive acquirer for smaller distributors. 
During fiscal 2022, this growth included the acquisition of Westside Building Material (“Westside”), one of the largest independent distributors of interior building products in the U.S. with nine locations across California and one in Nevada, and the acquisition of Ames Taping Tools Holding LLC (“Ames”), the leading provider of automatic taping and finishing (“ATF”) tools and related products to the professional drywall finishing industry and the acquisition of three smaller specialty products distributors. We also opened 13 greenfield locations.
Business Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are as follows:
•Expand Core Products. Our business strategy includes an emphasis on expanding our market share in our core products (wallboard, ceilings and steel framing) both organically and through acquisitions. 
•Grow Complementary Products. We are focused on growing our complementary product lines (insulation, lumber, ready-mix joint compound, tools, fasteners and various other construction products) to better serve our customers, diversify and expand our product offerings while driving higher sales and margins.
•Platform Expansion. Our growth strategy includes the pursuit of both greenfield openings and strategic acquisitions to further broaden our geographic markets, enhance our service levels and expand our product offerings. 
◦Greenfield openings. Our strategy for opening new branches is to further penetrate markets that are adjacent to our existing operations. Typically, we have pre-existing customer relationships in these markets but need a new location to fully capitalize on those relationships. 
◦Acquisitions. We also have a proven history of consummating complementary acquisitions in new and contiguous markets and intend to continue to pursue acquisitions. Due to the large, highly fragmented nature of our markets and our reputation throughout the industry, we believe we will continue to have access to a robust acquisition pipeline to supplement our organic growth. We use a rigorous targeting process to identify acquisition candidates that we believe will fit our culture and business model and we have built an experienced team of professionals to manage the acquisition and integration processes. As a result of our scale, purchasing power and ability to improve operations through implementing best practices, we believe we can continue to achieve substantial synergies and drive earnings accretion from our acquisition strategy. 
•Drive Improved Productivity and Profitability. Our business strategy entails a focus on enhanced productivity and profitability across the organization, seeking to leverage our scale and employ both technology and other best practices to deliver further margin expansion and earnings growth. We expect to continue to capture profitable market share in our existing footprint by delivering industry-leading customer service. 
Products
We provide a comprehensive product offering of wallboard, ceilings, steel framing and complementary construction products. By carrying a full line of wallboard and ceilings along with steel framing and other complementary products, we serve as a one-stop-shop for our customers. For information on net sales of our products, see Note 17, “Segments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Wallboard
Wallboard is one of the most widely used building products for interior and exterior walls and ceilings in residential and commercial structures due to its low cost, ease of installation and superior performance in providing comfort, fire resistance, thermal insulation, sound insulation, mold and moisture resistance, impact resistance, aesthetics and design elements. Wallboard is sold in panels of various dimensions, suited to various applications. In commercial and institutional construction projects, architectural specifications and building codes provide requirements related to the thickness of the panels and, in some cases, other characteristics, including fire resistance. In addition, there are wallboard products that provide some additional value in use. These include lighter weight panels, panels with additional sound insulation, and panels coated to provide mold and moisture resistance. In addition to the interior wallboard products described above, exterior sheathing is a water-resistant wallboard product designed for attachment to exterior sidewall framing as an underlayment for various exterior siding materials.
While highly visible and essential, wallboard typically comprises only 3% to 5% of a new home’s total cost. Given its low price point relative to other materials, we believe that there is no economical substitute for wallboard in either residential or commercial applications. We believe wallboard demand is driven by a balanced mix of both residential and commercial new construction as well as repair and remodeling (“R&R”) activity.
Ceilings
Our ceilings product line consists of suspended mineral fiber, soft fiber and metal ceiling systems primarily used in offices, hotels, hospitals, retail facilities, schools and a variety of other commercial and institutional buildings. The principal components of our ceiling systems are typically square mineral fiber tiles and the metal grid that holds the tile in place, and architectural specialty ceilings. Architectural specialty ceiling products are a growing component of our product offering given their specified, often customized nature and our ability to service customer requirements through a dedicated and experienced sales force focused on such products.
Our ceilings product line is primarily sold into commercial and institutional applications. Because interior contractors frequently purchase ceilings and wallboard from the same distributor, the breadth of our offerings serves to increase sales of all of our product lines, which are often delivered together to the same worksite as part of a commercial package. In the ceilings market, brand is highly valued and often specified by the architect of a commercial building. Because of our strong market position, we have exclusive access to the leading ceilings brands in many of our local markets. In addition, because ceiling tile systems differ in size, shape and aesthetic appeal between manufacturers, they can be replaced with the same brand for R&R projects. As a result, the leading brands’ installed base of product generates built-in demand for replacement product over time, and we can benefit from these recurring sales.
Steel Framing
Our steel framing product line consists of steel track, studs and the various other steel products used to frame the interior walls of a commercial or institutional building. Typically, the contractor who installs the steel framing also installs the wallboard, and the two products, along with ceilings, insulation and complementary products are sold together as part of a commercial package. Most of our steel framing products are sold for use in commercial buildings.
Complementary Products
We offer our customers complementary products, including insulation, lumber and other wood products and ready-mix joint compound, as well as ancillary products they need to complete a construction project, including tools, fasteners and safety products. We partner with leading vendors for many of these products and merchandise them in showrooms that are adjacent to many of our warehouses or free-standing, in the case of our Ames tool sales, rental and service centers. In addition, certain products are provided on a regional basis to address local preferences. We believe our customers value our product breadth and geographic reach, as well as our on-site expertise and consultative services. While pricing is important to our customers, availability, convenience and expertise are also important factors in their purchase decisions. These complementary products 
allow us to provide a full suite of products across our entire business, enhancing our margins and creating value for our customers. In recent years, through specific initiatives and strategic acquisitions, we have expanded our complementary product lines to further solidify our position as a one-stop-shop for the interior contractor and gain a greater share of their overall purchases. During fiscal 2022, we acquired the leading provider of ATF tools and related products to the professional drywall finishing industry. ATF tools enable interior finishing contractors to finish drywall joints faster than less productive hand finishing methods. 
Distribution
We distribute our core products and most complimentary products through our distribution centers. We distribute ATF tools and related tools and products through our tool sales, rental and service centers and an independent network of wholesale dealers. We also distribute our products through e-commerce platforms. 
We serve as a critical link between our suppliers and our fragmented customer base. Our sales, dispatch and delivery teams coordinate an often complicated, customized delivery plan to ensure that our delivery schedule matches the customer’s job site schedule, that deliveries are made with regard to the specific challenges of a customer’s job site, that no damage occurs to the customer’s property and, most importantly, that proper safety procedures are followed at all times. Often this requires us to send an employee to a job site before the delivery to document the specific requirements and safety considerations of a particular location. Given the logistical intensity of this process and the premium contractors place on distributors delivering the right product, at the right time, in the right place, we can differentiate ourselves based on service. In addition to executing a logistics-intensive service, we facilitate purchasing relationships between suppliers and our customer base by transferring technical product knowledge, educating contractors on proper installation techniques for new products, ensuring local product availability and extending trade credit.
Additionally, based on certain unique product attributes and delivery requirements, for some of our products, the distribution of these items requires a higher degree of logistics and service expertise than most other building products. For example, wallboard has a high weight-to-value ratio, is easily damaged, cannot be left outside and often must be delivered to a job site before or after normal business hours. As a value-added service, we often deliver our products directly to the specific room where it is installed. For example, we can place the amount and type of wallboard necessary for a fifth story room of a new building through the fifth story window using a specialized truck with an articulating boom loader. To do this effectively, we need to load the truck at the branch so that the amount and type of wallboard for each room of the building can be off-loaded by the articulating boom loader in the right sequence. In this way, the service we provide delivers significant value to our customers.
Our Industry
As the construction market in North America evolved during the second half of the 20th century, contractors began to specialize in specific trades within the construction process, and specialty distributors emerged to supply them. We, along with other specialty distributors, tailored our product offerings and service capabilities to meet the unique needs of these trades. Today, specialty distributors comprise the preferred distribution channel for wallboard, ceilings and steel framing in both the commercial and residential construction markets. In addition to focusing on their core products, specialty distributors also offer additional and ancillary products, which are complementary to their main products in an effort to provide their customers with a full suite of relevant products and to drive additional sales and margin opportunities. These products include insulation, lumber and other wood products, ready-mix joint compound, tools, fasteners, safety products and various other construction products.
We believe the success of the specialty distribution model in wallboard, ceilings and steel framing is driven by the strong value proposition we provide to our customers. Given the logistical complexity of the distribution services we provide to safely deliver and stock the right products to the appropriate locations, the expertise needed to execute effectively, and the special equipment required, we believe specialty distributors focused on wallboard, ceilings and steel framing are best suited to meet contractors’ needs. The main drivers for our products are commercial new construction, commercial R&R, residential new construction and residential R&R.
Commercial
Our addressable commercial construction market is comprised of a variety of commercial and institutional sub-segments with varying demand drivers. Our commercial markets include offices, hotels, retail stores and other commercial buildings, while our institutional markets include educational facilities, healthcare facilities, government buildings and other institutional facilities. The principal demand drivers across these markets typically include the overall economic outlook, the general business cycle, government spending, vacancy rates, employment trends, interest rates, availability of credit and demographic trends.
We believe commercial R&R spending has historically been more stable than new commercial construction activity. Commercial R&R spending is typically driven by several factors, including commercial real estate prices and rental rates, office vacancy rates, government spending and interest rates. Commercial R&R spending is also driven by commercial lease expirations and renewals, as well as tenant turnover. Such events often result in repair, reconfiguration and/or upgrading of existing commercial space. Commercial R&R activity has been negatively impacted by COVID-19 and there is uncertainty regarding timing and method of recovery.
Residential
Residential construction activity is driven by several factors, including demographics, the overall economic outlook, employment, income growth, availability of housing, home prices, availability of mortgage financing and related government regulations, interest rates and consumer confidence, among others.
We believe residential R&R activity is typically more stable than new residential construction activity. The primary drivers of residential R&R spending include changes in existing home prices, existing home sales, the average age of the housing stock, consumer confidence and interest rates.
Customers
We have a diversified portfolio of customers across the United States and Canada that includes professional contractors and homebuilders. Our customers vary in size, ranging from small contractors to large contractors and builders that operate on a national scale. We maintain local relationships with our contractors through our network of branches and our extensive salesforce. We also serve our large homebuilder customers through our local branches, but often coordinate the relationships on a national basis through our corporate facility. Our ability to serve multi-regional homebuilders across their footprints provides value to them and differentiates us from most of our competitors. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, our single largest customer accounted for 2.5% and 2.3% of our net sales and our top ten customers accounted for 8.1% and 9.0% of our net sales, respectively.
Suppliers
We source the products we distribute from various suppliers. We also purchase components used in assembling ATF tools. Our leading market position, North American footprint and superior service capabilities have allowed us to develop strong relationships with our suppliers. We maintain strong, long-term relationships with the major North American wallboard, ceilings, steel and insulation manufacturers, as well as vendors of other complementary building products, where the supply base is widely fragmented. Because we account for a meaningful portion of their volumes and provide them with an extensive salesforce to market their products, we are viewed by our suppliers as a key channel partner and have exclusive relationships with these suppliers in certain markets. We believe this position often provides us with advantaged procurement. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing strategy is to provide a comprehensive suite of high-quality products and superior services to contractors and builders reliably, safely, accurately and on-time. We have an experienced sales force who manage our customer relationships and grow our customer base. We have strategies to increase our customer base at both the corporate and local branch levels, which focus on building and growing strong relationships with our customers, whether they serve a small local market, or a national footprint. We believe that the experience and expertise of our salesforce differentiates us from our competition particularly in the commercial market, which requires a highly technical and specialized product knowledge and a sophisticated delivery plan. We also employ various marketing strategies to reach our customers in the most efficient and effective manner. We market our products through our websites, social media, targeted advertisements and a range of industry trade shows. 
Competition
We compete against other specialty distributors as well as big box retailers and lumberyards. Among specialty distributors, we compete against a few large distributors and many small, local, privately-owned distributors. Our largest competitors are Foundation Building Materials and L&W Supply Co. Inc (a subsidiary of ABC Supply Company). However, we believe smaller, regional or local competitors still comprise a significant proportion of the industry along with big-box retailers. The principal competitive factors in our business are pricing of products; availability of materials and supplies; technical product knowledge and expertise; advisory or other service capabilities; our delivery capabilities; and availability of credit. Brand recognition with respect to our complementary products, including ATF tools, is also important.
Seasonality
In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, sales of our products have been slightly higher in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions during these periods. Seasonal variations in operating results may be impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay construction projects. We anticipate that we will continue to experience these seasonal fluctuations in the future.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous intellectual property rights that we use in our business, including trademarks, tradenames, domains and patents. We maintain registered trademarks for the trade names under which certain of our local branches operate, Ames® stores and TapeTech® products. We also hold patents that relate to the design of our ATF tools. Generally, registered trademarks have a perpetual life, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We intend to maintain these trademark registrations as long as they remain valuable to our business. While we do not believe our business is dependent on any one of our trademarks, we believe the retention helps maintain customer loyalty. We vigorously protect all our intellectual property rights.
Human Capital
Employees
As of April 30, 2022, we had 5,475 active team members. We do not have a significant number of employees affiliated with labor unions. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. Additionally, we believe that the training provided through our employee development programs and our entrepreneurial, performance-based culture provides significant benefits to our employees.
Health, Safety and Wellness 
Providing a safe work environment for our employees, vendors, and customers is a primary mission for our company. Our goal is to incur zero accidents and to ensure that everyone goes home safely at the end of every day. To achieve this goal, we abide by all safety requirements and regulations and endeavor to eliminate unsafe conditions and minimize related risks by identifying and supporting safe work practices, promoting safety awareness, furnishing protective equipment, and providing employee training and education. An example of our safety philosophy at work is the implementation of a comprehensive and uniform vehicle fall protection safety policy across our organization that mitigates the risk of falls from vehicles, a potentially serious safety hazard in our business. 
We continue to take actions to protect the health and well-being of our employees during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These actions include providing personal protective equipment, expanding healthcare benefits and re-configuring working spaces and arrangements.
Safety is a constant focus of our management team with regular reporting to, and oversight by, our Board of Directors. We work together to protect employees, contractors, and customers by promoting a culture of shared responsibility with collaborative program development, best practices, and the open exchange of suggestions, ideas and concerns. 
Inclusion and Diversity
Every person is important to us and as such, we have a responsibility to foster a workplace that values contributions and perspectives from a variety of backgrounds, skills and experiences regardless of race, color, age, sex, national origin, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, or veteran status. Our differences make us a stronger team and the diversity in our thoughts and ideas makes us better able to serve our customers and other stakeholders. Both our Board of Directors and Leadership Team are committed to fulfilling this responsibility and recognize our work here is never done.
We have a company-wide inclusion and diversity program designed to support an inclusive and diverse work environment. We are committed to our comprehensive inclusion and diversity strategy to do our part to drive change. Recognizing this is an ongoing journey, we have committed human and financial resources to execute this strategy and further the work we need to do to within our Company and our communities, with regular counsel from and oversight by our Board of Directors.
Compensation and Benefits
We are committed to providing our employees with a competitive compensation package that rewards performance and achievement of desired business results. Our total compensation package includes, depending on the position, cash compensation (wages or base salary and incentive or bonus payments), company contributions toward additional benefits (such as health and disability plans), retirement plans with a company match and paid time off. We also offer the opportunity to become a stockholder through equity grants for management and our employee stock purchase plan. We analyze our compensation and benefits programs annually to ensure we remain competitive and make changes, as necessary.
