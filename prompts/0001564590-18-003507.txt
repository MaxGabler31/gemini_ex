ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 In this report, unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires, (i) the term “Koppers”, “Koppers Holdings”, the “Company”, “we” or “us” refers to Koppers Holdings Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, (ii) the term “KH” refers to Koppers Holdings Inc. and not any of its subsidiaries and (iii) the term “KI” refers to Koppers Inc. and not any of its subsidiaries. Koppers Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Koppers Holdings Inc. Koppers Holdings Inc. has substantially no operations independent of Koppers Inc. and its subsidiaries. The use of these terms is not intended to imply that Koppers Holdings and Koppers Inc. are not separate and distinct legal entities from each other and from their respective subsidiaries.
 Koppers Holdings Inc. was incorporated in November 2004 as a holding company for Koppers Inc. We are a leading integrated global provider of treated wood products, wood treatment chemicals, and carbon compounds. Our products and services are used in a vari
ety of niche applications in a diverse range of end-markets, including the railroad, specialty chemical, utility, residential lumber, agriculture, aluminum, steel, rubber, and construction industries. We serve our customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network, with manufacturing facilities located in North America, South America, Australasia, China and Europe.
 Business Segments and Products
 We operate three principal business segments: Railroad and Utility Products and Services (“RUPS”), Performance Chemicals (“PC”), and Carbon Materials and Chemicals (“CMC”).
 We believe our three business segments command leading market positions. Through our RUPS business, we believe that we are the largest supplier of railroad crossties to the North American railroads. Through our CMC business, we believe we are the largest global supplier of creosote to the North American railroad industry. Through our PC business, we believe that we are the largest global manufacturer and supplier of water-based wood preservatives and wood specialty additives to treaters who supply the residential, agricultural and industrial pressure-treated wood markets.
 Our RUPS and CMC operations are, to a substantial extent, vertically integrated. Through our CMC business, we process coal tar into a variety of products, including creosote, which is an intermediate material necessary in the pressure treatment of wood crossties and other related railroad products. The majority of the creosote we produce in North America and Europe is sold internally to our RUPS business for treating railroad crossties.
 Railroad and Utility Products and Services
 Our RUPS business sells treated and untreated wood products, rail joint bars and services primarily to the railroad markets in the United States and Canada and the utility market in Australia. We also operate a railroad services business that conducts engineering, design, repair and inspection services for railroad bridges, serving the same customer base as our North American railroad business.
 Railroad products and services include procuring and treating items such as crossties, switch ties and various types of lumber used for railroad bridges and crossings. Railroad products also include manufacturing and selling rail joint bars, which are steel bars used to join rails together for railroads. Utility products, located in Australia, include the pressure treatment of transmission and distribution poles for electric and telephone utilities. The RUPS business operates 13 wood treating plants and one rail joint bar manufacturing facility located throughout the United States, Canada and Australia. Our network of plants is strategically located near timber supplies to enable us to access raw materials and service customers effectively. In addition, our crosstie treating plants are typically adjacent to our largest railroad customers’ rail lines. 
 Our RUPS business manufactures its primary products and sells them directly to our customers through long-term contracts and purchase orders negotiated by our regional sales personnel and coordinated through our marketing group at corporate headquarters.
 Hardwoods, such as oak and other species, are the major raw materials in wood crossties. Hardwood prices, which account for more than 50 percent of a finished crosstie’s cost, fluctuate with the demand from other hardwood lumber markets, such as oak flooring, pallets and other specialty lumber products. Weather conditions can be a factor in the supply of raw material, as unusually wet or inclement conditions may make it difficult to harvest timber.
 In the United States, hardwood lumber for crossties is procured by us from hundreds of small sawmills throughout the northeastern, midwestern and southern areas of the country. The crossties are shipped via rail car or trucked directly to one of our crosstie treating plants, all of which are on line with a major railroad. The crossties are either air-stacked for a period of six to nine months or artificially dried by a process called boultonizing. Once dried, the crossties are pressure treated with creosote, a product of our CMC business. A substantial portion of our crossties are treated with borate, which is purchased from PC, in combination with creosote.

Koppers Holdings Inc.     2017 Annual Report
 
We believe we are the largest supplier of railroad crossties in North America. We have one principal competitor, Stella-Jones Inc., and several smaller regional competitors in the North American market. Competitive factors in the railroad crosstie market include price, quality, location, service and security of supply. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to our ability to obtain internally-sourced creosote and borate and our national network of treating plants which have direct access to our major customers’ rail lines. These advantages provide for security of supply and logistics advantages for our customers. We believe our Australian utility pole business is the largest producer of utility poles for the electrical communications utilities in Australia.
 Our RUPS business’ largest customer base is the North American Class I railroad market, which buys approximately 74 percent of all crossties produced in the United States and Canada. Approximately 75 percent of our North American RUPS sales are under long-term contracts and we currently supply all North American Class I railroads. We also have relationships with many of the approximately 550 short-line and regional rail lines. This also forms the customer base for our rail joint bar products. The railroad crosstie market is a mature market with approximately 17 million replacement crossties (both wood and non-wood) purchased during 2017. 
 Demand for railroad crossties may decline during winter months due to inclement weather conditions which make it difficult to harvest lumber and to install railroad crossties. As a result, operating results may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the severity of weather conditions and other variables affecting our products.
 Utility poles are produced mainly from the eucalyptus species in Australia. Most of these poles are purchased from large timber owners and individual landowners and shipped to one of our pole-peeling facilities. In Australia, in addition to utility poles, we market smaller poles to the agricultural landscape and vineyard markets. We treat poles with a variety of preservatives, including copper chromated arsenates, which we produce internally, and pentachlorophenol.
 Performance Chemicals
 Our PC business maintains sales and manufacturing operations in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America, Australia and New Zealand. The primary products supplied by PC are copper-based wood preservatives, including micronized copper quaternary and micronized copper azole (“MicroPro®”), micronized pigments (MicroShades®), alkaline copper quaternary, amine copper azole and chromated copper arsenate. The primary applications for these products include decking, fencing, utility poles, construction lumber and timbers, and vineyard stakes. Because we are a global supplier of wood preservatives, we face various competitors in all the geographic regions in which we participate.  
 PC supplies nine of the ten largest lumber treating companies in the United States, the largest treated wood market in the world, in addition to the three largest lumber treating companies in Canada. In North America, our PC business is vertically integrated through the manufacturing of copper compounds for our copper-based wood preservatives. We purchase and process approximately 25 million pounds of scrap copper, our key raw material, to meet the annual demand of this major market. Once the scrap copper is purchased, it is shipped to our manufacturing plants in Hubbell, Michigan and Millington, Tennessee for further processing into other copper compounds. We utilize swap contracts to hedge our exposure to copper price risk.
 We believe that being vertically integrated in copper manufacturing provides PC with an important competitive advantage and also provides our customers with the security of a continuous supply of wood preservatives. Likewise, we believe that our marketing, engineering, and technical support services provide added value to our customer base, who supply pressure-treated wood products to large retailers and independent lumber dealers. We believe another competitive advantage is provided by our strategic sourcing group, which procures scrap copper and other raw materials, such as chromic acid, tebuconazole, arsenic trioxide, dispersants and various biocides and co-biocides through the global market. 
 Carbon Materials and Chemicals
 Our CMC business manufactures its primary products and sells them directly to our global customer base under long-term contracts or through purchase orders negotiated by our regional sales personnel and coordinated through our global marketing group in the United States. Our four coal tar distillation facilities and five carbon materials terminals give us the ability to offer customers multiple sourcing and a consistent supply of high quality products.
 In 2014, we embarked on a plan to restructure our CMC operating footprint that reduced our global number of coal tar distillation facilities from the 11 that existed as of January 1, 2014 to four in total as of December 31, 2017. Our CMC business has experienced challenges over the past few years due to the closure of aluminum smelters that has occurred in North America, Western Europe and Australia. The smelting of aluminum requires significant amounts of energy, which is a major cost component for the aluminum industry. As a result, new production facilities are being built in regions with low energy costs such as the Middle East, while regions with higher energy costs such as North America, Western Europe and Australia have seen significant amounts of smelting capacity idled or closed over the last several years.

Our CMC business manufactures the following principal products:
  
◾ | creosote, used in the treatment of wood or as a feedstock in the production of carbon black;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | carbon pitch, a critical raw material used in the production of aluminum and steel;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | naphthalene, used as a feedstock in the production of phthalic anhydride and as a surfactant in the production of concrete, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | phthalic anhydride, used in the production of plasticizers, polyester resins and alkyd paints, respectively.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Creosote, carbon pitch, naphthalene, and carbon black feedstock are produced through the distillation of coal tar, a by-product generated through the processing of coal into coke for use in steel and iron manufacturing. Coal tar distillation involves the conversion of coal tar into a variety of intermediate chemical products in processes beginning with distillation. During the distillation process, heat and vacuum are utilized to separate coal tar into three primary components: chemical oils (approximately 20 percent), distillate (approximately 30 percent), and carbon pitch (approximately 50 percent). 
 In the United States, our primary coal tar raw material supply contracts generally have terms ranging from three to ten years, and most provide options for renewal. Pricing under these contracts is either formula-based or negotiated on a quarterly or semi-annual basis. Our primary European tar supply contract has a remaining term of approximately eight years and thereafter extends indefinitely unless terminated by a one-year advance notice and contains formula-based tar pricing. Our primary Australian supply contracts have terms ranging from five to ten years and contain formula-based pricing which is adjusted on an annual or semi-annual basis. Finally, in China, we have a raw material contract in place with our joint venture partner. This contract is coterminous with the applicable joint venture arrangement and provides for formula-based pricing adjusted on a monthly or quarterly basis.
 Research and Development
 PC’s global research group is located in the United States, with supplemental resources in the United Kingdom. We believe our investment in research and development keeps us on the leading edge of new wood preservation technologies. The wood preserving intellectual property that the PC research group has developed and patented remains a very important part of our wood preservative portfolio. This intellectual property includes micronizing various chemical and additive formulations and the methods of treating wood with these formulations. In particular, one of our patented technologies, MicroPro® wood preservative, has been adopted since its commercialization by many of our wood treating customers and the industry’s retailers and lumber dealers. The earliest expiration date for patents relating to micronized wood preservative compositions is April 9, 2024.
 Research activities related to our CMC business are directed toward new product development regarding alternate uses for coal tar and technical service efforts to promote the use of creosote and vacuum-distilled carbon pitch.
 Expenditures for research and development were $9.0 million, $6.6 million and $5.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 Technology and Licensing
 In 1988, we acquired the “Koppers” trademark from Koppers Company, Inc. The association of the name with the chemical, building, wood preservation and coke industries is beneficial to our company, as it represents long-standing, high quality products. Trademarks relating to our PC business, such as “MicroPro®”, “Protim” and “Solignum” are important in this segment of our business, and as long as we continue to use the name “Koppers” and the trademarks associated with our wood preservation business and comply with applicable registration requirements, our right to use the name “Koppers” and the other trademarks should continue without expiration. The expiration of other trademark rights is not expected to materially affect our business.
Backlog
 Generally, Koppers does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders. Inventory and production levels are typically driven by expectations of future demand based on contractual obligations.
Seasonality
 Demand for residential, commercial, and agricultural treated lumber may decline during winter months due to weather conditions. In addition, inclement or winter weather may affect access to certain raw materials or impact operations at our facilities. As a result, operating results may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the severity of weather conditions and other variables affecting our products.  Historically, our operating results have been significantly lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters as compared to the second and third calendar quarters.
