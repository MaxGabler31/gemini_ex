ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
 
Loop Industries, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company” or “Loop”) is an innovative technology company focused on sustainability. Our mission is to accelerate the world’s shift toward sustainable plastic and away from its dependence on fossil fuels, essentially enabling a truly circular economy.
 
Loop’s patented technology decouples the production of PET/Polyester plastic from fossil fuels by depolymerizing waste PET plastic and polyester fiber into its base building blocks. The monomers are then re-polymerized into virgin-quality PET plastic that meets FDA requirements for use in food-grade plastic packaging such as water and soda bottles. Our monomers can also be re-polymerized to produce polyester fiber for textile applications. 
 
Our technology uses waste PET plastics such as water bottles, soda bottles, consumer packaging, carpets, polyester textiles and industrial waste as feedstock to process. These feedstocks are available through municipal triage centers, industrial recycling and landfill reclamation projects.
 
Loop’s technology allows for low value and no value waste PET plastics to be upcycled into high value PET packaging for consumer goods companies. Our low energy depolymerization technology specifically targets PET/Polyester plastic allowing for the removal of all impurities, such as colors/dyes, labels and all organic and inorganic waste.

Prospective Future Growth
 
During the last three years, we have positioned Loop to be a leader in sustainability and the circular economy. We built our pilot plant in Terrebonne, Canada to optimize and showcase our proprietary depolymerization technology. We have completed the expansion of our pilot plant to increase its capacity and demonstrate continuous operations as we begin our next phase of commercialization. 
 
We are developing plans to commercialize our technology in collaboration with multinational supply chain management companies and to manufacture Loop™ branded PET resin. 
 
Our goal is to negotiate contracts with global consumer goods companies for the sale of Loop™ branded resin, and enable them to achieve their timeline and stated goals for sustainability.
 
We are continuing to invest in further optimizing our technology and developing our organizational strength and depth. Our research and development innovation hub in Terrebonne, Canada will continue optimizing our current technology as well as innovating into new areas of sustainability.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our patents, brand names, product designs and marks. 
 
We have two patent groups with claims relating to our proprietary technology for depolymerization of PET.
