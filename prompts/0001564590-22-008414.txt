Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage genetic medicines company committed to delivering life-changing treatments for people battling devastating diseases. Using PRISM™, our proprietary discovery and drug development platform that enables the precise design, optimization and production of novel stereopure oligonucleotides, we aspire to develop best-in-class medicines that target the transcriptome to treat genetically defined diseases with a high degree of unmet need.
 We are developing oligonucleotides that target ribonucleic acid (“RNA”) and harness existing cellular machinery to reduce the expression of disease-promoting RNA or proteins, restore the production of functional proteins, or modulate protein expression. By intervening at the RNA level, we have the potential to address diseases that have historically been difficult to treat with small molecules or biologics, while retaining the ability to titrate dose, modulate duration of effect, and avoid risk of permanent off-target genetic changes and other challenges associated with DNA editing or gene therapy approaches. Oligonucleotides have additional advantages as a therapeutic class, including the ability to access multiple tissue types and the ability to modulate the frequency of dosing to ensure broad distribution within tissues over time. Oligonucleotides also have well-established manufacturing processes and validated test methods based on decades of improvements, as well as established regulatory, access and reimbursement pathways.
 Our approach is based on the scientific insight that the biological machinery necessary to address genetic diseases already exists in human cells and can be controlled with the right tools. We have built a genetic toolkit comprised of multiple therapeutic modalities, including RNase-H mediated silencing, RNAi, splicing, and RNA base editing, all of which leverage learnings and optimizations from our PRISM platform and allow us to design built-for-purpose molecules to optimally address disease biology.  
 Our A-to-I RNA base editing oligonucleotides (“AIMers”) represent our newest therapeutic modality. AIMers are designed to correct single base mutations on RNA transcript, thereby avoiding permanent changes to the genome that occur with DNA-targeting approaches. Rather than using an exogenous editing enzyme, AIMers recruit proteins that exist in the body, called ADAR (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) enzymes, which naturally possess the ability to change an adenine (A) to an inosine (I), which cells read as guanine (G). This approach enables simplified delivery and avoids the risk of irreversible off-target effects with DNA-targeting approaches. AIMers are short in length, fully chemically modified, and use novel chemistry, including proprietary PN backbone modifications and chiral control, which make them distinct from other ADAR-mediated editing approaches. 

Our PRISM platform is built on the recognition that a significant opportunity exists to tune the pharmacological properties of oligonucleotide therapeutics by leveraging three key features of these molecules: sequence, chemistry, and stereochemistry. Our unique ability to control stereochemistry, which is a reality of chemically modified oligonucleotides, provides the resolution necessary to optimize pharmacological profiles. PRISM therefore enables us to design stereopure oligonucleotides, which are comprised of molecules with atoms precisely and purposefully arranged in three-dimensional orientations at each linkage. These differ from the mixture-based oligonucleotides currently on the market or in development by others. Additionally, to mitigate pharmacological risks and potential manufacturing challenges, our approach focuses on designing short, chemically modified oligonucleotides without the need for complex delivery vehicles.
 Our work in developing stereopure oligonucleotides has enabled the continued evolution of PRISM and our drug discovery process of selecting genetically defined targets, identifying a sequence and applying the therapeutic modality we determine is best suited for the disease biology. We use our PRISM platform engine to screen candidates and optimize the pharmacologic profile based on predefined design principles, which reflect a deep understanding of how the interplay among oligonucleotide sequence, chemistry and backbone

stereochemistry impacts key pharmacological properties. Through continued exploration of these interactions using iterative analysis of in vitro and in vivo outcomes and machine learning-driven predictive modeling, we also continue to refine our design principles that we deploy across subsequent programs.
 In August 2020, we publicly introduced our novel PN backbone chemistry modifications, which have been shown preclinically to increase potency, distribution and durability of effect across various modalities. PN chemistry has been incorporated into all of our current clinical, preclinical and discovery-stage programs.
 We have a robust and diverse pipeline of PN-modified, stereopure oligonucleotides, including our clinical silencing and splicing programs, as well as our AIMers. Our lead clinical development programs are designed to treat genetic diseases within the central nervous system (“CNS”), including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”), frontotemporal dementia (“FTD”), Huntington’s disease (“HD”), and muscular dystrophies, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”). These programs include:
  
- | WVE-004 (silencing), our C9orf72 molecule for the treatment of C9orf72-associated ALS and FTD,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | WVE-003 (silencing), our mHTT SNP3 molecule for the treatment of HD, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | WVE-N531 (splicing), our exon 53 molecule for the treatment of DMD.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 With RNA base editing, our initial focus is on using GalNAc-conjugated AIMers to treat hepatic diseases and our lead program is designed to treat alpha-1antitrypsin deficiency (“AATD”). We expect to select an AATD AIMer development candidate and initiate IND-enabling toxicology studies in the third quarter of 2022.
 We continue to invest in PRISM to further evolve and apply the expanding capabilities and promise of our unique platform. We have also established and continue to enhance our internal current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) manufacturing capabilities to increase control and visibility of our drug substance supply chain, while continuing to innovate oligonucleotide manufacturing.
 Our Current Programs


Additional details regarding our lead therapeutic programs are set forth below.
 Neurology 
 WVE-004: In ALS and FTD, we are advancing WVE-004, which uses our novel PN chemistry and preferentially targets the transcripts containing the hexanucleotide G4C2 expansion in the C9orf72 gene. In C9 BAC transgenic mice, WVE-004 led to substantial reductions in repeat-containing C9orf72 transcripts and dipeptide repeat (“DPR”) proteins that are sustained for at least six months, without disrupting total C9orf72 protein expression. 
 The FOCUS-C9 trial is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of intrathecal doses of WVE-004 for patients with C9-ALS and/or C9-FTD. Additional objectives include measurement of polyGP proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (“CSF”), plasma and CSF pharmacokinetics and exploratory biomarker and clinical endpoints. The FOCUS-C9 trial is designed to be adaptive with dose level and dosing frequency being guided by an independent committee. Preclinical models that have established pharmacologic activity have informed the starting dose for this trial. 
 6

In July 2021, we announced the initiation of dosing in the FOCUS-C9 clinical trial. We expect to share clinical data in 2022 to provide insight into the clinical effects of PN chemistry and enable decision making for WVE-004.
 WVE-003: In HD, we are currently advancing WVE-003, a stereopure antisense oligonucleotide designed to selectively target an undisclosed single nucleotide polymorphism (“SNP”), “mHTT SNP3”, associated with the disease-causing mutant huntingtin (“mHTT”) mRNA transcript within the HTT gene. WVE-003 incorporates our novel PN chemistry, as well as learnings from our first-generation HD programs. Targeting mRNA with SNP3 allows us to lower expression of transcript from the mutant allele, while leaving the healthy transcript relatively intact, thereby preserving wild-type (healthy) huntingtin (“wtHTT”) protein, which is important for neuronal function. Our allele-selective approach may also enable us to address the pre-manifest, or asymptomatic, HD patient population in the future. In preclinical studies, WVE-003 showed dose-dependent and selective reduction of mHTT mRNA in vitro, potent and durable knockdown of mHTT mRNA and protein in vivo. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (“PK-PD”) model for WVE-003 based on preclinical data predicts that WVE-003 may attain sufficient concentrations to engage mHTT transcript in both the cortex and striatum and decrease expression of the mHTT protein. 
 The SELECT-HD trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of intrathecally administered WVE-003 for patients with early manifest HD. Additional objectives include measurement of mHTT and wtHTT protein and exploratory pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) endpoints. The SELECT-HD trial is designed to be adaptive, with dose level and dosing frequency being guided by an independent committee. Preclinical models that have established pharmacologic activity have informed the starting dose for this trial. In September 2021, we announced the initiation of dosing in the SELECT-HD trial. We expect to share clinical data in 2022 to provide insight into the clinical effects of PN chemistry and enable decision making for WVE-003.
 WVE-N531: In DMD, we are advancing WVE-N531, which is designed to target exon 53 within the dystrophin gene. WVE-N531 is designed to cause the cellular splicing machinery to skip over this exon during pre-mRNA processing, which restores the dystrophin mRNA reading frame and enables production of truncated, but functional dystrophin protein. Exon-skipping produces dystrophin from the endogenous dystrophin gene (not micro or mini dystrophin expressed from a vector), under the control of native gene-regulatory elements, resulting in normal temporospatial expression. WVE-N531 is both our first splicing candidate and our first systemically administered candidate incorporating PN chemistry to be assessed in the clinic. 
 In September 2021, we announced the initiation of dosing in an open-label clinical trial evaluating WVE-N531 as a treatment for boys with DMD who are amenable to exon 53 skipping. We expect to share clinical data, including muscle biopsies, in 2022 to provide insight into the clinical effects of PN chemistry and enable decision making for WVE-N531.
 Hepatic
 We are initially focused on developing AIMers to address genetic hepatic diseases. Our AIMers are relatively short and stable (fully chemically modified), which enables us to leverage clinically-proven N-acetyl galactosamine (“GalNAc”)-mediated delivery to hepatocytes with subcutaneous dosing. 
 
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (“AATD”): Our AATD program is the first to leverage our novel RNA editing capability that uses GalNAc-conjugated AIMers (RNA base editing oligonucleotides) and endogenous ADAR enzymes by correcting the single RNA base mutation, ADAR editing may provide an ideal approach for increasing circulating levels of wild-type AAT protein and reducing aggregation in the liver, thus simultaneously addressing both the lung and liver manifestations of the disease. We expect to select an AATD AIMer development candidate and initiate IND-enabling toxicology studies in the third quarter of 2022.
 Note on the COVID-19 Global Pandemic 
 The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, and variants thereof, continues to have widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets, and business practices. We are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic and related developments, and our focus remains on safeguarding employee and patient health, while minimizing the negative effects on our business and continuing to advance the research and development of our therapeutic candidates. For discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business and financial results, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Strategy 
 We are building a fully integrated genetic medicines company by leveraging PRISM to design, develop and commercialize optimized disease-modifying medicines for indications with a high degree of unmet medical need in genetically defined diseases. Our lead clinical programs are focused in neurology and are aimed at addressing ALS, FTD, HD, and DMD using silencing and splicing modalities. We are also using our RNA base editing modality to address hepatic indications using GalNAc-conjugated AIMers, with our lead program aimed at treating AATD. In addition to driving clinical and preclinical programs, we are continuously investing in PRISM to fully unlock the potential of our unique and expanding platform capabilities. 
 7

The key components of our strategy are as follows: 
  
• | Extend our leadership in oligonucleotides. We intend to establish a dominant position in the field of oligonucleotides, advancing basic research and pharmacology using stereochemistry and novel modifications across multiple therapeutic modalities and target classes. Our work has already led to the development of AIMers for RNA base editing, as well as the introduction of PN backbone chemistry modifications for potential therapeutic use. Through PRISM, our efforts continue to reveal structure-activity relationships among sequence, chemistry and backbone stereochemistry that may allow us to further tune the activity of our oligonucleotides in a previously unexplored, modality-specific manner.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly advance our differentiated neurology portfolio. We are committed to transforming the care of rare, neurological genetic diseases. We are currently advancing three clinical-stage candidates: WVE-003, WVE-004, and WVE-N531, which were all designed with novel PN backbone chemistry modifications developed from our PRISM platform. Clinical data from these candidates will inform individual program decisions as well as future portfolio prioritization.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our pipeline using our RNA base editing modality, led by hepatic diseases. In 2021, we rapidly advanced our RNA base editing modality (“AIMers”). With this therapeutic modality, we are positioned to potentially develop first-in-class RNA base editing therapeutics, starting with hepatic indications that leverage GalNAc-conjugated delivery. We will continue to invest in our RNA base editing modality through wholly-owned AIMer programs as well as through potential partnerships and collaborations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage manufacturing leadership in oligonucleotides. We have built a hybrid internal / external manufacturing model that gives us the capability to produce stereopure oligonucleotides at scales from one micromole to potential commercial scale. Through our internal manufacturing, based in our Lexington, Massachusetts facility, we have the capacity to support multiple discovery-, preclinical-, and early clinical-stage programs and have the established expertise to efficiently conduct manufacturing runs for oligonucleotides across a spectrum of modalities. We believe that leveraging our internal manufacturing capabilities along with expertise from contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) facilitates our growth and enhances our ability to secure drug substance for current and future development activities.

Oligonucleotides
 Nucleic acid therapeutics, including oligonucleotides, are an innovative class of drugs that can modulate the function of target RNAs to ultimately affect the production of disease-associated proteins or prevent the accumulation of pathogenic RNA species, which are emerging as important factors in human disease. Oligonucleotides can regulate protein and RNA via several different molecular mechanisms. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized as silencing, those that promote degradation of the target RNA, including antisense and RNAi; splicing, those that involve binding to the target RNA and modulating its function by promoting exon skipping; and ADAR-mediated RNA-editing. 
 The unique capability of oligonucleotides to address a wide range of genomic targets that impact multiple therapeutic areas creates potentially significant market opportunities for us to develop molecules to treat a broad spectrum of human diseases, including diseases where no medicines currently exist or for which existing treatments are not optimal. 
 The oligonucleotides we are currently developing employ the following molecular mechanisms: 
  
• | Antisense, which uses a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to bind to a specific sequence in a target RNA strand that encodes a disease-associated protein or pathogenic RNA. The resulting two-stranded molecule (“duplex”) is then recognized by a cellular enzyme called RNase H, which cleaves, or cuts, the target RNA in the duplex, thereby preventing the disease-associated protein from being made.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RNA interference (“RNAi”), which uses a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to recognize a specific sequence and engages RNAi machinery known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (“RISC”) to silence a target RNA that is either pathogenic itself or encodes a disease-associated protein, thereby preventing the accumulation of the pathogenic species (RNA or protein).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Splicing / exon-skipping, which is the processing of a nascent pre-mRNA transcript into messenger RNA (“mRNA”) by removing introns and joining exons together. Exon skipping uses a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to bind to a particular sequence within a target pre-mRNA and direct the cellular machinery to delete, or splice out, certain specific regions of that RNA. Often, the underlying mutation leads to non-productive mRNA, yielding no functional protein. Use of the exon-skipping modality permits the cellular machinery to bypass and assemble a partially functional protein, thereby mitigating or alleviating the disease that would otherwise result.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ADAR-mediated RNA base editing, which involves a therapeutic oligonucleotide that uses endogenous ADAR (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) to edit Adenosines in target RNAs. This technology can be used to correct missense and nonsense mutations to restore or modify protein activity. Other applications of this technology include the ability to target AUGs in the 5’-UTR for translational upregulation, target AG splice acceptor sites to modify exon splicing, and target amino acids (codons) to alter their function, examples of which include amino acids involved in post-translational modifications, to synthetically alter signaling pathways and/or protein stability, or post-translational protein processing, such as altering a protease cleavage sequence.

Stereochemistry of Oligonucleotide Backbone Modifications Impacts Pharmacology
 Oligonucleotides are comprised of a sequence of nucleotides—the building blocks of RNA and DNA—that are linked together by a backbone of chemical bonds. In nucleic acid molecules that have not been modified for therapeutic use, the nucleotides are linked by phosphodiester (“PO”) bonds. Such unmodified nucleic acid molecules are unsuitable for use as therapeutics because they are rapidly degraded, are rapidly cleared by the kidneys and are taken up poorly by targeted cells. 
 Backbone chemistry modifications such as the phosphorothioate (“PS”) modification, one of the most common backbone modifications used in oligonucleotides, can improve the stability, biodistribution and cellular uptake of oligonucleotides. 
 A consequence of introducing backbone modifications, such as PS modifications, into an oligonucleotide is that it also introduces a chiral center at each phosphorus, creating stereoisomers designated as either an “Sp” or “Rp” isomer. As shown below, these stereoisomers have identical chemical compositions but different three-dimensional arrangements of their atoms and consequently have different chemical and biological properties. 
 


During traditional oligonucleotide synthesis, the isomeric configuration at each chiral backbone modification is random (either Rp or Sp), resulting in a complex mixture containing many stereoisomers (known as diastereomers). Using PS modifications as an example, each PS linkage introduces a chiral center, thereby doubling the number of stereoisomers in the product, so that a traditional preparation of a PS-containing oligonucleotide contains 2N stereoisomers, where N represents the number of PS modifications.  
 
Stereoisomers can possess different chemical and pharmacological properties. For example, certain stereoisomers can drive the therapeutic effects of a drug while others can be less beneficial or can even contribute to undesirable side effects. The greater the variation among a drug’s constituent stereoisomers, the greater the potential to diminish the drug’s efficacy and safety when it is a complex mixture. 
 Prior to the development of our technology, it was not possible to create stereopure oligonucleotides, meaning molecules where the configuration of each chiral backbone linkage is precisely controlled during chemical synthesis. Moreover, because of the sheer number of stereoisomers present in a mixture, it would be impractical, if not impossible, to physically isolate the most therapeutically optimal stereoisomer from within a mixture. For these reasons, all chiral backbone-modified oligonucleotides currently on the market and in development by others are mixtures of many stereoisomers, which we believe are not optimized for stability, catalytic activity, efficacy or toxicity. 
 In small molecule therapeutics, U.S. regulators have long sought to eliminate the risks potentially posed by drug mixtures containing multiple stereoisomers. Since 1992, the FDA has recommended full molecular characterization of stereoisomers within small-molecule drug mixtures. Historically, it has not been possible to achieve such characterization for nucleic acid therapeutic drug mixtures, which can contain tens of thousands to millions of distinct pharmacological entities. Based on our published and ongoing preclinical studies, we believe that we can design and synthesize stereopure chemically modified oligonucleotides that demonstrate superior pharmacological properties compared with mixture-based oligonucleotides. We believe that PRISM has the potential to set a new industry standard for the molecular characterization of complex nucleic acid therapeutic drug mixtures. 
 We continue to develop new types of backbone modifications, other than PS modifications, that can be chirally controlled with our technology.
 PRISM: Our proprietary discovery and drug development platform
 Through PRISM, our proprietary discovery and drug development platform, we have discovered and expect to continuously elaborate on the relationships between the chemical makeup of an oligonucleotide, including the three-dimensional orientation or arrangement of its atoms, and its pharmacology (i.e., stability of the drug, activity against the target, specificity for the target and safety of the drug). For example, we realized the impact of our novel PN backbone chemistry in vivo in preclinical studies only because we evaluated its impact in the context of an otherwise stereopure backbone (Kandasamy et al., 2022; doi: 10.1093/nar/gkac037, 
 9

Kandasamy et al., 2022; doi: 10.1093/nar/gkac018). In addition, we have defined relationships between various 2’-sugar modifications to the nucleotide (such as methoxy, methoxyethyl, fluoro, locked), and the chemistry and stereochemistry of the backbone that enhances oligonucleotide pharmacology, providing an enhanced therapeutic profile. 
 Our rational process for designing stereopure oligonucleotides, which is based on the interplay among oligonucleotide sequence, chemistry and backbone stereochemistry, allows us to selectively optimize for the therapeutic modality in order to generate best-in-class oligonucleotides. With PRISM, we leverage the diversity created by backbone stereochemistry to expand the parameters that we explore to optimize oligonucleotides. We are using these ongoing discoveries to guide our drug development activities, which we believe will lead to medicines that are more specific, can be dosed at lower concentrations, less frequently, or some combination of these characteristics as well as with improved therapeutic profiles.
 Advantages of Our Approach 
 We believe that PRISM is a significant advancement in the development of oligonucleotides. The advantages of our approach include: 
  
• | Ability to rationally design product candidates with optimized pharmacological properties. Our platform combines our unique ability to construct stereopure oligonucleotides with a deep understanding of how the interplay among oligonucleotide sequence, chemistry and backbone stereochemistry impacts key pharmacological properties. By exploring these interactions through iterative analysis of in vitro and in vivo outcomes and machine learning-driven predictive modeling, we continue to define design principles that we deploy across programs to rapidly develop and manufacture clinical candidates that meet pre-defined product profiles. PRISM has also enabled us to further innovate our nucleic acid chemistry, including the application of novel PN chemistry backbone modifications to our pipeline programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad applicability. PRISM is applicable to oligonucleotides acting via multiple therapeutic modalties, including antisense, RNAi, exon skipping, splicing, ADAR-mediated RNA editing, microRNA and others, and is compatible with a broad range of chemical modifications and targeting moieties.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simplified delivery. We can take advantage of simplified delivery strategies, leveraging free-uptake and endogenous enzymes to avoid delivery vehicles such as lipid nanoparticles (“LNPs”) or AAV, and our oligonucleotides are GalNAc compatible for targeted delivery to hepatocytes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary production of stereopure oligonucleotides. Our scientists have developed expertise in the techniques required to produce adequate supplies of chemically modified stereopure oligonucleotide materials for our preclinical and clinical activities. In addition, we believe we have the intellectual property position and know-how necessary to protect, advance and scale these production processes to support our clinical trials and potential future commercial supply.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalability and Manufacturing. Our manufacturing process and technical expertise in designing stereopure oligonucleotides is unique. We believe that our scalable synthesis processes will allow us to meet demand for cGMP-qualified clinical trial supply, as well as the potential for commercial manufacturing at a cost of goods and potential cost-per-patient that are comparable to stereorandom oligonucleotides.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Proprietary Chemistry 
 Backbone Stereochemistry 
 In our foundational Nature Biotechnology paper (Iwamoto N, et al. Nature Biotechnol. 2017;35(9):845-851), we described our studies using our proprietary chemistry to design and synthesize stereopure oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide mixtures based on mipomersen. Mipomersen, an oligonucleotide containing 20 nucleotides and 19 PS modifications, is synthesized by traditional oligonucleotide chemistry; thus, it is a mixture of over 500,000 different stereoisomers (219 = 524,288). We rationally designed and synthesized individual stereoisomers of mipomersen, each having position-specific and distinct stereochemistry, and conducted studies comparing these defined stereoisomers with the mipomersen stereomixture. These and other preclinical studies have demonstrated that stereochemistry and pharmacology are directly related, and that by controlling stereochemistry, we can impact multiple aspects of pharmacology, including stability, catalytic activity, efficacy, specificity, and safety. 
 We have subsequently published multiple additional manuscripts since the start of 2021 that provide evidence that stereopure oligonucleotides can be developed to have superior pharmacology to stereorandom oligonucleotides; These manuscripts are listed below:

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PN Backbone Chemistry Modifications
 Our initial investigations into backbone chemistry and stereochemistry on oligonucleotide pharmacology focused on the widely used PO and PS backbones because they are amenable to all oligonucleotide modalities. In August 2020, we announced the introduction of novel PN backbone chemistry modifications (“PN”) to our repertoire of backbone modifications, which involve replacing a non-bridging oxygen atom with a nitrogen-containing moiety, as shown below. 




We have incorporated these PN modifications – specifically phosphoryl guanidine – into oligonucleotide compounds. As with PS modifications, PN modifications are chiral, and we have the capacity to control PN backbone stereochemistry. Unlike PS modifications, PN modifications are neutral, meaning that the negative charge of the oligonucleotide is reduced with every PN modification added to the backbone. In preclinical experiments, we have demonstrated that judicious use of PN backbone chemistry modifications in stereopure oligonucleotides have generally increased potency, tissue exposure and durability of effect across our silencing, splicing and editing modalities.
 
PRISM Therapeutic Modality Types
 Using PRISM, we have designed and optimized diverse sets of stereopure oligonucleotides, which allows us to characterize and compare the behavior of various stereoisomers. With each new target, we gain insight into how the interplay between sequence, chemistry, including 2’-modifications and backbone chemistry, and stereochemistry impacts activity, and we build these learnings into our future programs. 
 
In the next section, we describe different therapeutic modalities for which we have used PRISM to optimize stereopure oligonucleotides.
 Silencing – RNase H-mediated degradation and RNAi
 Using PRISM, we can produce stereopure PN-modified oligonucleotides that promote potent and specific RNA transcript silencing activity in preclinical experiments. 
 
11


RNase H-mediated degradation: In our Nucleic Acids Research paper (Kandasamy et al., 2022; doi: 10.1093/nar/gkac018), we illustrated the impact of PN backbone chemistry modifications for an RNase-H mediated silencing modality. In addition to the data reported in the paper, we have performed screens for identifying RNaseH-targeting sequences in iCell neurons in vitro using free uptake. This screen was initially performed with stereopure molecules with PS and PO backbone chemistry modifications, and the oligonucleotides are rank-ordered from left to right according to their potency. Next, we performed a head-to-head comparison with molecules that contained the same sequence and the same 2’-ribose chemistry, but with the addition of PN chemistry at select locations in the backbone. The introduction of a few PN linkages signficantly increases the potency of the vast majority of the stereopure PS / PO molecules, with ~80% of them yielding at least 75% knockdown. These results, shown below, suggest we are able to target sequence space that would otherwise be inaccessible. 
 

Moving in vivo, we have demonstrated potent silencing activity of multiple targets in the CNS of non-human primates with stereopure, PN-modified oligonucleotides. In the results shown below for an undisclosed target, non-human primates received a single 12 mg dose by intrathecal injection. This single dose led to substantial and widespread mRNA reduction one month after administration.  
 

aCSF: artificial cerebrospinal fluid; CTX: cortex; HP: hippocampus; CSC: cervical spinal cord; LSC: lumbar spinal cord; STR: striatum
 
12


RNAi: We have also applied our stereopure PS and PN modifications to the RNAi silencing modality using double-stranded siRNAs and demonstrated potent and durable silencing in vivo. The data, shown below, highlight that stereochemistry and PN chemistry can enhance the pharmacology of RNAi when applied to current state-of-art RNAi design. 
 
Splicing - exon skipping
 With PRISM, we have optimized stereopure oligonucleotides that promote efficient exon skipping in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo to restore protein production. In our exon-skipping programs, as with our other modalities, the sequence, chemistry and backbone stereochemistry of oligonucleotides impact their activity. 
 In our Nucleic Acids Research paper (Kandasamy et al., 2022; doi: 10.1093/nar/gkac018), we highlight the impact of PN chemistry on exon skipping. In one application from the paper, we plotted the in vitro skipping efficiency of compounds containing PS / PO backbone chemistry modifications, depicted in the graph below by the teal dots, which are rank-ordered from left-to-right based on their exon-skipping potency in human myoblasts. The more potent molecules are shifted upwards as they are restoring expression. The navy dots represent the impact of a few stereopure PN modifications in compounds with otherwise identical sequences and 2’-ribose chemical modifications. There is an overall shift upwards in activity among the PS / PO / PN compounds, representing a substantial potency gain in most cases. 
 

13


Moving in vivo, we demonstrated successful exon-skipping in mdx mice that correlated with dystrophin expression. PN-modified oligonucleotides led to more exon-skipping and more dystrophin production in all muscles after six weeks of treatment, as shown below, but especially in the heart and diaphragm. These results demonstrate the impact of a few PN linkages – with no delivery vehicle or conjugate – significantly improves the PK-PD profiles for stereopure compounds. 

Data adapted from Figure 5, Kandasamy et al., 2022; doi: 10.1093/nar/gkac018
 
Editing - ADAR-mediated RNA editing
Most recently, we have applied our PRISM platform to the generation of short, single-stranded, highly specific A-to-I (G) RNA-editing oligonucleotides – called “AIMers”. Because our AIMers are relatively short and stable (fully chemically modified), we can leverage clinically proven GalNAc-mediated delivery to hepatocytes to further increase tissue uptake with subcutaneous dosing. We are developing fully chemically modified AIMers with and without GalNAc conjugation. In preclinical studies, we have evaluated thousands of AIMers, assessing a variety of sugar and base modifications, backbone chemistry and stereochemistry, and other parameters such as AIMer length to produce insight into the relationship between an AIMer’s structure and its ability to elicit ADAR-editing activity. 
 With PRISM, we have generated stereopure AIMers, optimized for chemistry and stereochemistry, which promote RNA editing with endogenous adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes in cellular models. As shown in the figure below, we show the activity of beta-actin-editing stereopure AIMers, with and without PN linkages, compared to a matched stereorandom AIMer (shown in black) in primary human hepatocytes. These AIMers are GalNAc conjugated to increase uptake in hepatocytes. The addition of PN chemistry substantially improves both potency and editing efficiency.

We have achieved efficient RNA editing in vitro with our AIMers across a variety of cell lines, including non-human primate and human primary hepatocytes, as shown in the figures below. We observed potent, dose-dependent RNA editing with three chemically distinct stereopure AIMers (ACTB 1, ACTB 2, ACTB 3) via GalNAc-mediated uptake. 
 


We next evaluated these same ACTB-editing AIMers in vivo in non-human primates (“NHPs”), and the results are shown in the figures below. For this study, we dosed NHPs subcutaneously once a day for five days. We took liver biopsy samples at baseline at two days and 45 days after the last dose to evaluate editing. We detected up to 50% editing two days after the last dose as compared to a baseline of 0% editing, as shown in the figure below on the left. These editing results were durable: we continued to see significant editing 45 days after the last dose. The pharmacokinetic data, shown in the figure below in the center, confirmed that a significant amount of AIMer was still detectable in the liver at that time. To assess off-target editing for the whole transcriptome, a mutation-calling software was used to call edit sites. From this analysis, we observed nominal off-target editing across the transcriptome. Sites where potential off-target editing occurred mapped predominately to non-coding regions of the transcriptome, and had either low read coverage in the analysis or occurred at low percentages of less than 10%, indicating that these are relatively rare events, as shown in the figure below on the right.


15


We have also demonstrated efficient editing activity with unconjugated AIMers in vitro in both iCell neurons and iCell astrocytes, with EC50s for astrocytes reaching the 200 nM range in vitro.
 
We have also demonstrated potent (up to 65%) and durable (out to at least four months) editing of UGP2 mRNA in vivo in multiple regions of the CNS following a single AIMer dose in a mouse model with human ADAR, as shown in the figure below. 



We have also observed productive editing beyond liver and CNS with unconjugated AIMers in multiple tissue types including retina (below top right), kidney, liver, lung and heart of NHPs (below bottom left), and human PBMCs in vitro (below bottom right).





16


The application of PRISM to RNA editing opens the door to therapeutic applications extending beyond the restoration of protein function. We can use ADAR to upregulate protein expression, to modify protein function by altering post-translational modifications or protein-protein interactions, or to alter protein stability.  
 





To exemplify our ability to modulate protein-protein interactions using ADAR, we evaluated the well characterized KEAP1/NRF2 system. Through direct protein-protein interactions, KEAP1 negatively regulates the activity of NRF2 as an inducer of antioxidant gene expression. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we investigated if we could mimic the cellular stress response by using ADAR to edit individual amino acids at the protein-protein interaction interface between NRF2 and KEAP1 in vitro. If these edits work as designed, we would expect to see downstream activation of the NRF2-dependent gene expression program even in the absence of cellular stressors. As shown below, treatment with each AIMer resulted in increased expression of known downstream NRF2-dependent genes involved in the antioxidant response. Control treatment did not increase expression of any of the NRF2-dependent genes, indicating that AIMer treatment did not lead to NRF2-dependent gene expression changes through non-specific mechanisms such as increased cellular stress.

Therapeutic Programs 
 Our clinical-stage therapeutic programs include two silencing programs for indications in the CNS – WVE-004 for ALS / FTD and WVE-003 for HD – and a splicing program for protein restoration in muscle – WVE-N531 for DMD. In the third quarter of 2022, we expect to select a development candidate and initiate IND-enabling toxicology studies for our first ADAR editing program leveraging GalNAc-conjugated delivery for a hepatic indications – AATD.

 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia
 Hexanucleotide G4C2 expansions found in the C9orf72 gene are one of the most common genetic causes of the sporadic and inherited forms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Some patients exhibit characteristics of both ALS and FTD, indicating that these diseases form part of a continuum of neurological disease with some overlap in symptoms between them. 



ALS Background and Market Opportunity 
 ALS is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progression and degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Diagnosis may take up to 12 months and is made clinically by assessing the signs of upper and lower motor neuron degeneration in the same region of the body. Patients initially present with limb-onset disease (approximately 70% of patients), bulbar-onset disease (approximately 25% of patients) or with initial trunk or respiratory involvement (approximately 5% of patients). Age of onset is generally in the mid-to-late 50’s, and median survival is three years; however, up to 24% of patients survive for five to ten years. Survival in patients with C9orf72 ALS may be shorter than in patients with sporadic ALS. 
 In the United States and Europe combined, there are approximately three to five ALS patients per 100,000 people. This translates to approximately 13,000 diagnosed patients in the United States, although the total prevalence may be around 20,000 people in the United States. There are one or two newly diagnosed cases of ALS per year, per 100,000 people in the United States and Europe combined, resulting in approximately 5,000 newly diagnosed patients in the United States each year. While the majority of ALS cases are sporadic, approximately 10% of cases are found to be familial in nature. The C9orf72 gene mutation is currently the most common demonstrated mutation related to ALS and is present in approximately 40% of familial ALS and 8 – 10% of sporadic ALS patients. 
 ALS Current Treatments
 There is significant unmet need for the treatment of ALS. Two medicines are currently approved in the United States for the treatment of ALS. Rilutek (riluzole), an inhibitor of glutamate release, was approved in 1995 for the treatment of patients with ALS. It was demonstrated to extend survival by three to six months. Radicava (edaravone) was approved in 2017 for the treatment of ALS. Administration of edaravone resulted in a significantly smaller decline in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (“ALSFRS-R”) through six months of treatment as compared to placebo.
 FTD Background and Market Opportunity
 FTD is a neurodegenerative disorder of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes of the brain. It is characterized by changes in personality, cognition (e.g., language impairment and executive dysfunction), and behavior (e.g., disinhibition, apathy and compulsivity). Diagnostic criteria categorize FTD into either the behavioral variant (approximately 60% of patients) or speech/language variant (approximately 40% of patients) based on the primary symptom observed at presentation; however, FTD results in dementia in all patients. The majority of FTD associated with the G4C2 expansion in the C9orf72 gene is categorized as the behavioral variant. FTD frequently has an onset in mid-life, and death typically occurs within three to 14 years of onset. FTD is the second most common form of early-onset dementia in people under the age of 65, after AD.
 In FTD, the C9orf72 gene mutations appear in approximately 38% of familial cases and approximately 6% of sporadic cases. FTD affects approximately 55,000 people in the United States, of which 10 – 50% are familial cases and 50 – 90% are sporadic cases.
 18

FTD Current Treatments
 There are currently no disease-modifying therapies approved for the treatment of FTD. Treatment to date has involved use of medications for symptomatic management.
 Our Program
 WVE-004: In ALS and FTD, we are advancing WVE-004, which uses our novel PN chemistry and preferentially targets the transcripts containing the hexanucleotide G4C2 expansion in the C9orf72 gene. WVE-004 is designed to minimize the impact on normal C9orf72 protein in patients, thereby reducing potential on-target risk. In vitro, WVE-004 potently and selectively reduced V3 transcripts in iPSC-derived motor neurons, which were derived from a patient carrying a C9orf72-repeat expansion. In C9 BAC transgenic mice, WVE-004 led to substantial reductions in repeat-containing C9orf72 transcripts and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins that are sustained for at least six months, without disrupting total C9orf72 protein expression. 
 FOCUS-C9 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial: The FOCUS-C9 trial is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of intrathecal doses of WVE-004 for patients with C9-ALS and/or C9-FTD. Additional objectives include measurement of polyGP proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (“CSF”), plasma and CSF pharmacokinetics and exploratory biomarker and clinical endpoints. The FOCUS-C9 trial is designed to be adaptive with dose level and dosing frequency being guided by an independent committee. Preclinical models that have established pharmacologic activity have informed the starting dose for this trial. In July 2021, we announced the initiation of dosing in the FOCUS-C9 clinical trial. We expect to share clinical data in 2022 to provide insight into the clinical effects of PN chemistry and enable decision making for WVE-004.
 Expansion of the G4C2 repeat alters the normal expression of the C9orf72 gene and causes the production of repeat-containing RNAs. These RNAs accumulate in cellular nuclei in the form of RNA foci and can be translated into DPR proteins. Neuronal degeneration associated with the expression of the repeat expansion is hypothesized to arise either from a toxic loss-of-function mechanism due to a reduction in C9orf72 protein or a toxic RNA gain-of-function mechanism through the accumulation of RNA foci and/or DPRs in the brain and spinal cord.
 
In our Nature Communications paper (Liu, Y et al. Nat Comms. 2021), we report the discovery of a new targeting sequence that is common to all C9orf72 transcripts but enables preferential knockdown of repeat-containing transcripts in multiples models and C9BAC transgenic mice. Wild-type C9orf72 alleles produce three mRNA transcripts: variant 1 (V1), variant (V2), and variant (V3). We apply our platform to generate stereopure oligonucleotides that target a sequence at the exon 1b-intron 1 junction, termed Splice Site-1b (“SS1b”), that is common to all C9orf72 transcripts (shown below in “b”, pre-mRNAs corresponding to V1-V3 are illustrated; the coral star indicates SS1b). In multiple in vitro model systems, an unoptimized stereopure oligonucleotide yields preferential knockdown of exon1a-containing transcripts. The Nature Communications paper describes our work to identify and validate the targeting site to achieve variant-selective knockdown of expansion-containing C9orf72 transcripts. The publication highlights the foundational work that led to the development of our clinical candidate.



By targeting the V1 and V3 mRNA transcripts that contain the G4C2 expansion and sparing V2 transcripts and healthy C9orf72 protein, WVE-004 has the potential to reduce both RNA-based and protein-based toxicity, thereby impacting the disease course and slowing the progression of ALS or FTD. 
 
19


In vitro, WVE-004 potently and selectively reduced V3 transcripts in iPSC-derived motor neurons, which were derived from a patient carrying a C9orf72 repeat expansion.
 

WVE-004 led to dose-dependent knockdown of V3 transcripts and DPRs in mouse spinal cord tissue. In the transgenic model, mice express the human C9orf72 repeat-containing gene from a bacterial artificial chromosome (“BAC”) insertion. We observed qualitatively similar dose-dependent knockdown of V3 transcripts and the polyGP DPR protein in mouse cortex tissue (data not shown). 
 



20


In C9 BAC transgenic mice, WVE-004 led to substantial reductions in repeat-containing C9orf72 transcripts and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins that are sustained for at least six months, without disrupting total protein expression. 
 


Huntington’s Disease 
 Background and Market Opportunity 
 Huntington’s Disease (“HD”): HD is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disease that results in early death and for which there is no cure. In HD patients, there is a progressive loss of neurons in the brain leading to cognitive, psychiatric and motor disabilities. HD is caused by a defect (i.e., an expanded CAG triplet repeat) in the HTT gene, which results in production of mutant HTT (“mHTT”) protein. HD patients still possess some wild-type (healthy) HTT (“wtHTT”) protein, which is important for neuronal function and which may be neuroprotective in an adult brain. Studies suggest a dominant gain of function in mHTT protein and a concurrent loss of function of wtHTT protein may be important components of the pathophysiology of HD. Accordingly, therapeutic approaches for HD that involve suppression of wtHTT may have detrimental long-term consequences. There is growing evidence of the importance of wtHTT, including a 2020 Nature publication (Poplawski, G.H.D., et al. Injured adult neurons regress to an embryonic transcriptional growth state. Nature 581, 77–82 (2020)) which evaluated conditional knockout of huntingtin in 4-month old mice (post-neuronal development) and demonstrated that huntingtin is at the center of the regeneration transcriptome and plays an essential role in neural plasticity. In addition, at our Analyst and Investor Research Day in October 2019, key opinion leaders in HD research presented data suggesting that wtHTT is neuroprotective in an adult brain; transport of key neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (“BDNF”) is regulated by wtHTT levels; and HD may be caused by a dominant gain of function in mHTT and a loss of function of wtHTT protein. Further, the relative proportion of wtHTT to mHTT may be critical based on evidence that suggests increased amount of wtHTT relative to mHTT may result in slower disease progression (measured by age-at-onset). 
 21

Symptoms of HD typically appear between the ages of 30 and 50 and worsen over the next 10 to 20 years. Many describe the symptoms of HD as similar to having amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease simultaneously. Patients experience a reduction in motor function and psychological disturbances. Life expectancy after symptom onset is approximately 20 years. In the most symptomatic stages, often lasting over 10 years, affected persons become fully dependent upon others to manage all activities of daily living; they lose the ability to make decisions, feed themselves and walk, and often require premature placement in a long-term care facility. It is estimated that approximately 30,000 people in the United States have symptomatic HD. Our allele-selective approach may also enable us to address the pre-manifest, or asymptomatic, HD patient population in the future. More than 200,000 people in the United States are at-risk of developing HD.
Current Treatments 
 There are no approved treatments that can reverse or slow HD progression. Current pharmacological therapies only address HD symptoms. Antipsychotics are used to manage depression, irritability and chorea (involuntary movements). Xenazine (tetrabenazine) and Austedo (deutetrabenazine) are the only two therapies approved for the treatment of chorea associated with HD in the United States. 
Our Programs
 WVE-003: In HD, we are currently advancing WVE-003, a stereopure antisense oligonucleotide designed to selectively target an undisclosed single nucleotide polymorphism (“SNP”), “mHTT SNP3”, associated with the disease-causing mutant huntingtin (“mHTT”) mRNA transcript within the HTT gene. SNPs are naturally occurring variations within a given genetic sequence and in certain instances can be used to distinguish between two related copies of a gene where only one is associated with the expression of a disease-causing protein. Approximately 40% of the HD population carries SNP3 according to published literature (Carroll et al., Molecular Therapy, 2011). WVE-003 incorporates our novel PN chemistry, as well as learnings from our first-generation HD programs. Targeting mRNA with SNP3 allows us to lower expression of transcript from the mutant allele, while leaving the healthy transcript relatively intact. The healthy transcript is required to produce wtHTT protein which is important for neuronal function. We commonly refer to this method (or approach) as “allele-selective targeting.” Our allele-selective approach may also enable us to address the pre-manifest, or asymptomatic, HD patient population in the future. In preclinical studies, WVE-003 showed dose-dependent and selective reduction of mHTT mRNA in vitro, potent and durable knockdown of mHTT mRNA and protein in vivo. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model for WVE-003 based on preclinical data predicts that WVE-003 may attain sufficient concentrations to engage mHTT transcript in both the cortex and striatum and decrease expression of mHTT protein.
 


22


SNP Phasing Technology: To verify that HD patients have a SNP selectively available on the mutant allele, we investigated multiple technologies that could provide highly accurate results and rapid turnaround. We conducted a prospective observational study of the frequency of two SNPs in patients with HD, which confirmed the feasibility of rapidly and prospectively identifying SNPs in association with the mHTT allele in patients with HD (Claassen et al., Neurol Genet 2020; Svrzikapa et al., Molecular Therapy 2020). We have an agreement with Asuragen, Inc. (“Asuragen”), a molecular diagnostics company that was acquired by Bio-Techne Corporation on April 6, 2021, for the development and potential commercialization of companion diagnostics for our allele-selective therapeutic program in HD. This agreement includes the use of their scalable SNP phasing technology (AmplideX®  HTT SNP/Repeat Phasing Clinical Trial Assay) in our SELECT-HD trial for WVE-003. 
 SELECT-HD Phase 1b/2a clinical trial:  The SELECT-HD trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a trial to assess the safety and tolerability of intrathecally administered WVE-003 for patients with early manifest HD. Additional objectives include measurement of mHTT and wtHTT protein and exploratory pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, clinical and MRI endpoints. The SELECT-HD trial is designed to be adaptive, with dose level and dosing frequency being guided by an independent committee. Preclinical models that have established pharmacologic activity have informed the starting dose for this trial. In September 2021, we announced the initiation of dosing in the SELECT-HD clinical trial. We expect to share clinical data in 2022 to provide insight into the clinical effects of PN chemistry and enable decision making for WVE-003.
 Preclinical studies
 WVE-003 showed potent knockdown of HTT mRNA in a preclinical study using induced pluripotent stem cell (“iPSC”)-derived motor neurons homozygous for SNP3 (as shown below). 
 

WVE-003 promoted RNase H–mediated degradation of mHTT RNA while sparing wtHTT RNA in a biochemical assay. 
 

23


We further demonstrated selectivity of WVE-003 in assays performed in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons from patients with HD that are heterozygous for SNP3. These cells are amenable to the free-uptake delivery method that is an integral part of PRISM. WVE-003 selectively silences the mutant transcript while largely sparing the wild-type transcript. By comparison, the pan-silencing active comparator silences both mutant and wild-type HTT transcripts. 
 


We next tested our SNP3 compounds in vivo in a BACHD model for Huntington’s disease. This model expresses a mutant version of the human HTT gene. The model is homozygous for SNP3, so it is not suitable for assessing selectivity, but enables assessment of target engagement in vivo. Importantly, the model expresses multiple copies of the transgene; however, not all of the copies contain SNP3, so our SNP3 compounds cannot silence all the mHTT transcripts in these mice. After administration, WVE-003 showed significant mHTT mRNA knockdown compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at the highest concentration tested in the striatum and all but the lowest concentration tested in the cortex. WVE-003 showed comparable reduction of mHTT mRNA to that of the pan-silencing oligonucleotide, despite having fewer targets in these mice.
 


24


In the cortex of BACHD mice, WVE-003 showed significant mHTT knockdown compared PBS through week 4. In the striatum, WVE-003 led to significant and durable mHTT knockdown that was sustained for 12 weeks, compared with PBS. WVE-003 led to significantly more knockdown than the pan-silencing reference compound at week 12. Since most but not all of the transgenes in this model contain SNP3, our SNP3 compounds are handicapped slightly versus the pan-silencing active comparator.
 


In vivo allele-selectivity: Using an allele-selective mHTT SNP3 targeting oligonucleotide that represented a back-up candidate to our WVE-003 clinical candidate, we investigated allele-selectivity in vivo. After administration (3 x 100 ug ICV doses), the allele-selective molecule decreased mHTT and spared wtHTT in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus of Hu97/18 mice up to 12 weeks post-injection throughout the brain. By contrast a pan-silencing control decreased expression of both mHTT and wtHTT, and the silencing activity was both less potent and less durable than the allele-selective molecule, especially in the striatum.

Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 
 Background and Market Opportunity
 SCA3 is a rare, hereditary (autosomal dominant) progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in a lack of muscle control and coordination of the upper and lower extremities. Signs and symptoms of SCA3 may begin between childhood and late adulthood, and they vary greatly. Symptoms may include progressive clumsiness in the arms and legs, spasticity, difficulty with gait, and impaired speaking, swallowing and eye movements. Symptoms of the disease worsen over time, eventually leading to paralysis. Some patients 
 25

with SCA3 develop dystonia or symptoms similar to those of PD, including twitching of the face or tongue, and nerve damage (neuropathy). Life expectancy ranges from the mid-30s in the more severe forms, to a nearly normal life expectancy for those with milder forms of the disease. 
 SCA3 is caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene, resulting in an abnormally long polyglutamine stretch in the encoded ataxin-3 protein. Mutant ataxin-3 protein is thought to cause widespread neuronal loss in the brain and spinal cord, likely through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism. SCA3 is the most common dominantly inherited form of ataxia. The prevalence of SCA3 is believed to be one to two cases in 100,000 people with significant geographic and ethnic variations.
 Current Treatments
 There are currently no disease-modifying therapies approved for treatment of SCA3. Treatment to date has involved the use of medications for symptomatic management, as well as physical and occupational therapy.
Our Program
 In SCA3, we are continuing to advance our program targeting ATXN3.
 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
 Background and Market Opportunity
 DMD is a rare, genetic progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome that affects approximately one in 5,000 newborn boys around the world (approximately 20,000 new cases annually). The dystrophin protein is part of a protein complex called the dystrophin-associated protein complex that acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell’s structural framework with a lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell through the muscle cell membrane. The dystrophin-associated protein complex protects the muscle from injury during contraction and relaxation. Patients with DMD typically develop muscle weakness in the early years of life and become wheelchair-bound in their early teens. As the disease progresses, DMD patients typically develop respiratory, orthopedic and cardiac complications. Cardiomyopathy and breathing difficulties usually begin by the age of 20, and few individuals with DMD live beyond their thirties.
Current Treatments
 While there are approved therapies for DMD, there is no cure, and there continues to be significant unmet medical need. In most countries, corticosteroids are the standard drug therapy, which slows the progression of muscle weakness and delays loss of ambulation by two to three years. In February 2017, Emflaza (deflazacort) became the first corticosteroid in the United States approved by the FDA as a treatment for DMD patients older than five years of age.
 In 2016, Sarepta Therapeutics’ Exondys 51™ (eteplirsen) received accelerated approval in the United States for the treatment of patients with DMD, who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. Two drugs have received accelerated approval in the United States for DMD patients with a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 53 skipping: Sarepta Therapeutics’ Vyondys 53™ (golodirsen) in 2019 and NS Pharma’s Viltepso™ (viltolarsen) in 2020. NS Pharma has also received Marketing Authorization for Viltepso in Japan. In 2021, Sarepta’s Amondys 45™ (casimersen) received accelerated approval for DMD patients with a mutation amenable to exon 45 skipping. According to U.S. accelerated approval guidelines, approval is based on a surrogate endpoint that is likely to predict clinical benefit, but no clinical benefit needs to be established at the time of FDA approval. No clinical benefit has yet been established for eteplirsen, golodirsen, viltolarsen, or casimersen. Thus, in accordance with the U.S. accelerated approval regulations, the FDA is requiring Sarepta to conduct clinical trials to verify and describe the clinical benefit of eteplirsen, golodirsen, and casimersen.  Similarly, NS Pharma is required to conduct a clinical trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit of viltolarsen. If any of these confirmatory trials fail to verify clinical benefit, the FDA could initiate proceedings to withdraw approval of the respective drug(s). 
 In 2014, PTC Therapeutics’ Translarna™ (ataluren) was the first disease-modifying treatment to receive conditional approval by the EMA for the treatment of ambulatory DMD patients over 5 years of age who have a nonsense mutation (12% of DMD cases) in the dystrophin gene. In 2016, the EMA did not allow Translarna to convert to full marketing authorization; rather, it granted a renewal of the conditional approval. In 2018, EMA expanded the conditional approval for Translarna to include treatment of ambulatory DMD patients ≤2 years of age who have a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene. In June 2020, the EMA removed a statement from the summary of product characteristics (“SmPC”) for Translarna that “efficacy has not been demonstrated in non-ambulatory patients.” 
 26

Our Program
 WVE-N531: In DMD, we are advancing WVE-N531, which is designed to target exon 53 within the dystrophin gene. WVE-N531 is designed to cause the cellular splicing machinery to skip over this exon during pre-mRNA processing, which restores the dystrophin mRNA reading frame and enables production of truncated, but functional dystrophin protein. Exon-skipping produces dystrophin from the endogenous dystrophin gene (not micro or mini dystrophin expressed from a vector), under the control of native gene-regulatory elements, resulting in normal temporospatial expression. WVE-N531 is both our first splicing candidate and our first systemically administered candidate incorporating PN chemistry to be assessed in the clinic. 
 WVE-N531 clinical trial: In September 2021, we announced the initiation of dosing in an open-label clinical trial evaluating WVE-N531 as a treatment for boys with DMD who are amenable to exon 53 skipping. We expect to share clinical data, including muscle biopsies, in 2022 to provide insight into the clinical effects of PN chemistry and enable decision making for WVE-N531.
 
Preclinical data
 In vitro, WVE-N531 induced dose-dependent exon 53 skipping up to 49% and dystrophin protein restoration up to 71% in DMD patient-derived myoblasts carrying a deletion of exons 45-52. In these experiments, cells were exposed to WVE-N531 at 0.1 µM-10 µM under gymnotic conditions. After four days of oligonucleotide treatment, efficiency at skipping exon 53 was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. After six days of oligonucleotide treatment, protein lysate was analyzed by western blot for dystrophin protein expression.
 

27


To understand the effects of PN backbone chemistry modifications in vivo, we conducted a study in a double-knockout or “dKO” mouse model, which has a mutation in exon 23 leading to a lack of dystrophin, as well as a mutation leading to a lack of utrophin. We compared the effects of a PS/PO-containing molecule dosed at 150 mg/kg weekly to a PN-containing compound dosed at the same level, a PN-containing compound at 75 mg/kg every other week and a control group dosed with PBS. Other than the placement of the three PN backbone linkages, these molecules have the same sequence and chemistry. There is a significant increase in survival in those animals treated with PN containing compounds as compared with the other treatment groups. As shown in the figure below on the left, both cohorts of mice receiving the PN-containing molecules (shown in dark blue and light green) had 100% survival at the time of study termination, with a median age of approximately 40 weeks. By comparison, the median survival for the mice receiving the PS/PO-containing molecule dosed at 150 mg/kg weekly was approximately 12 weeks and the dKO control animals that received PBS had a median survival of approximately seven weeks.  These results were published in Nucleic Acids Research (Kandasamy et al., 2022; doi: 101.1093/nar/gkac018).
 

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
 Background and Market Opportunity
 
We are leveraging our ADAR editing platform capability to develop a potentially novel treatment for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (“AATD”). AATD is a rare, inherited genetic disorder that is commonly caused by a G-to-A point mutation in the SERPINA1 gene; this mutant allele is termed the Z allele. This mutation leads to misfolding and aggregation of alpha-1 antitrypsin (“AAT”) protein in hepatocytes and a lack of functional AAT in the lungs. People with AATD typically exhibit progressive lung damage, liver damage or both, leading to frequent hospitalizations and potentially terminal lung disease and/or liver disease. While the few approved therapies for AATD modestly increase circulating levels of AAT in those with the lung pathology, there are no approved therapies to address the liver pathology. Approximately 200,000 people in the United States and Europe are homozygous for the Z allele, which is the most common form of severe disease. 
Current Treatments
 There are five treatments currently approved in the United States for chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy in adults with emphysema due to congenital deficiency of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (Alpha1-PI). Per FDA labeling for each, the effect of augmentation therapy with any alpha1-proteinase inhibitor on pulmonary exacerbations and on the progression of emphysema in Alpha1-PI deficiency has not been demonstrated in randomized, controlled clinical trials. Patients with AATD can also be treated with therapies used in other lung diseases including bronchodilators to open airways and corticosteroids to reduce chronic inflammation common in the lungs of AATD patients.
 
There are currently no approved therapies to prevent the accumulation of the misfolded AAT protein in the liver. Treatments are available to help deal with intestinal bleeding, fluid in the abdomen, nutritional issues and other complications from scarring of the liver, but ultimately many patients will progress towards requiring a liver transplant. 
 28

Our Program
 
Our AATD program is the first to leverage our novel RNA editing capability that uses GalNAc-conjugated AIMers (RNA base editing oligonucleotides) and endogenous ADAR enzymes by correcting a single base in the mutant SERPINA1 mRNA. ADAR editing may provide an ideal approach for increasing circulating levels of wild-type AAT protein and reducing aggregation in the liver, thus simultaneously addressing both the lung and liver manifestations of the disease. We expect to select an AATD AIMer development candidate and initiate IND-enabling toxicology studies in the third quarter of 2022. 
 

Preclinical data
 In a primary hepatocyte SERPINA1 Z allele cell model, we demonstrated that editing the Z allele mRNA restored protein secretion from hepatocytes, as shown in the figure below. We observed upwards of 60% correction of the Z allele mRNA back to wild-type transcript (as shown below on the left), which prevented protein misfolding and increases secretion of editing AAT protein from hepatocytes (as shown below on the right). Edited, wild-type AAT protein was confirmed to be wild-type by mass spectrometry and the function of secreted, edited AAT protein was confirmed by neutrophil elastase inhibition assay. 



29


With a GalNAc-AIMer (specifically “SA1-4”) dosed at 3 x 10 mg/kg, we reported proof-of-concept preclinical in vivo data that demonstrated up to 40% editing of human SERPINA1 Z allele mRNA in liver at an initial time point, which resulted in a therapeutically meaningful increase in circulating, functional wild-type AAT protein (as shown in the two charts below). This initial in vivo study utilized our proprietary transgenic mouse model, which has both the human SERPINA1 Z-allele, as well as human ADAR that is expressed comparably to human cells.

To evaluate the specificity of our GalNAc-AIMer (specifically “SA1-4 AIMer”), we performed RNA-seq on liver biopsies from treated animals. The figure below on the left shows total sequence coverage across the entire SERPINA1 transcript for the AIMer-treated samples. The percentage of unedited “T” and edited “C” reads are indicated for each group. Editing is only detected at the intended, on-target sequence in the SERPINA1 transcript. Thus, the protein being produced using this approach is truly wild-type M-AAT protein. This also confirms there is no editing of bystander residues, as has been seen with DNA targeting approaches. To assess off-target editing for the whole transcriptome, we applied a mutation-calling software to search edit sites. From this analysis, we observed minimal off-target editing across the transcriptome. Sites where potential off-target editing occurred had either low read coverage in the analysis or occurred at low percentages of less than 10%, indicating that these are rare events, as shown below on the right. In both analyses, we find a high percentage of editing that is specific for the target site in the SERPINA1 transcript.

Using an optimized AIMer (specifically “SA1-5”), we demonstrated restoration of functional AAT protein in a transgenic mouse model with bi-weekly doses of 10 mg/kg following initial loading doses. At 19 weeks, AIMer treatment resulted in approximately 60% RNA editing of SERPINA1 transcript and circulating serum AAT levels (18.5 uM) in AIMer treated mice that were approximately 5-fold greater than PBS-treated control (as shown below). 
 


Ophthalmology
In ophthalmology, we have generated in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo data in preclinical studies that support the potential of our stereopure oligonucleotides for the treatment of rare, inherited eye diseases. Our preclinical data demonstrate that a single intravitreal injection of stereopure oligonucleotide in the eye of non-human primates (“NHPs”) resulted in greater than 95% knockdown of a target RNA in the retina for at least 4 months, which supports the potential to design candidates that could achieve a therapeutic effect with only two doses per year. We have also used AIMers to achieve up to 50% mRNA editing of UGP2 in the posterior of mouse eyes following a single intravitreal dose. Our pipeline includes two preclinical programs: Usher syndrome type 2A (“USH2A”) and retinitis pigmentosa due to a P23H mutation in the RHO gene (“RhoP23H”). 
 USH2A program: Usher syndrome type 2A is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by hearing loss at birth and progressive vision loss beginning in adolescence or adulthood. It is commonly caused by a mutation that introduces a stop codon and prevents translation of usherin protein, leading to progressive degeneration of photoreceptors. Antisense oligonucleotides that preferentially promote exon skipping may restore production of functional usherin protein and potentially confer therapeutic benefit in patients. 
 
Using a stereopure antisense oligonucleotide, we induced dose-dependent USH2A exon skipping that was 2-fold more potent than a stereorandom reference ASO under gymnotic conditions in Y79 cells. To bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo studies, we used a stereopure antisense oligonucleotide to induce dose-dependent USH2A exon skipping in a NHP retina ex vivo under gymnotic conditions 48 hours after treatment. Finally, we used a stereopure oligonucleotide to demonstrate dose-dependent exon-skipping in NHP retina in vivo. 
 Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) program: Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of rare, genetic eye disorders resulting in progressive photoreceptor cell death and gradual loss of function. Currently, there is no cure for this condition. Approximately 10% of U.S. autosomal dominant RP cases are caused by the P23H mutation in the rhodopsin gene (RHO). Mutant P23H rhodopsin protein is thought to misfold and co-aggregate with wild-type rhodopsin, resulting in a gain-of-function or dominant negative effect in rod photoreceptor cells. 
 We have presented preclinical data demonstrating dose-dependent reduction of the mutant RhoP23H transcript following treatment with our stereopure, allele-selective sequence, with preservation of wild-type Rhodopsin transcripts. 
 
At the 2021 Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Conference, we shared the first in vivo data, which was performed by our collaborator at University of Louisville, to show functional benefit after treatment with our RhoP23H candidate in a severe humanized pig model. PN-containing oligonucleotides preserve retinal cell morphology, prevent rod cell death and restore rod cell function in severe humanized pig model of adRP.

Licensing Arrangements and Research Collaborations 
 Our business strategy is to develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of novel nucleic acid therapies. As part of this strategy, we have entered into, and may enter into new partnership and collaboration agreements as a means of advancing our own nucleic acid therapeutic programs, investing in third-party technologies to further strengthen PRISM and leveraging external partnerships to extend the reach of PRISM into therapeutic areas where our platform demonstrates a competitive advantage. 
Our Partnerships 
 Takeda
 In February 2018, Wave Life Sciences USA, Inc. (“Wave USA”) and Wave Life Sciences UK Limited (“Wave UK”) entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the “Takeda Collaboration Agreement”) for a global strategic collaboration (the “Takeda Collaboration”) with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”), pursuant to which Wave USA, Wave UK and Takeda agreed to collaborate on the research, development and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics for disorders of the Central Nervous System (“CNS”). The Takeda Collaboration provided us with at least $230.0 million in committed cash and Takeda with the option to co-develop and co-commercialize our CNS development programs in (1) Huntington’s disease (“HD”); (2) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and frontotemporal dementia (“FTD”); and (3) our discovery-stage program targeting ATXN3 for the treatment of spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (“SCA3”) (collectively, “Category 1 Programs”), which we will have the right to co-commercialize in the United States. In addition, the Takeda Collaboration provided Takeda with the right to exclusively license multiple preclinical programs for CNS disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (collectively, “Category 2 Programs”). In April 2018, the Takeda Collaboration became effective and Takeda paid Wave $110.0 million as an upfront payment. Takeda also agreed to fund our research and preclinical activities in the amount of $60.0 million during the four-year research term and to reimburse Wave for any collaboration-budgeted research and preclinical expenses incurred by us that exceed that amount. 
 On October 15, 2021, we and Takeda entered into the Second Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, which amended the Category 2 component of the two-part collaboration (the “Category 2 Programs”). As discussed above, under Category 2 of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we had granted Takeda the right to exclusively license multiple preclinical programs for CNS disorders during a four-year research term. Pursuant to the terms of the Amendment, we and Takeda discontinued the Category 2 component of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement and Takeda paid us an additional $22.5 million for collaboration-related research and preclinical expenses. As a result of the Amendment, we are free to advance our CNS programs independently or enter partnerships in the CNS field outside of the three specified targets, C9orf72, HTT and ATXN3, including WVE-004 and WVE-003, that are part of the ongoing late-stage Category 1 Programs.  The Category 1 component of the original Takeda Collaboration Agreement remains in effect and is unchanged by the Amendment.
 Simultaneously with Wave USA and Wave UK’s entry into the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a share purchase agreement with Takeda (the “Takeda Equity Agreement,” and together with the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, the “Takeda Agreements”) pursuant to which it agreed to sell to Takeda 1,096,892 of our ordinary shares at a purchase price of $54.70 per share. In April 2018, we closed the Takeda Equity Agreement and received aggregate cash proceeds of $60.0 million. The parties also agreed for the shares purchased by Takeda to be subject to certain lock-up and standstill restrictions and carry certain registration rights, customary for transactions of this kind.
 With respect to Category 1 Programs, we will be responsible for researching and developing products and companion diagnostics for Category 1 Programs through completion of the first proof of mechanism study for such products. Takeda will have an exclusive option for each target and all associated products and companion diagnostics for such target, which it may exercise at any time through completion of the proof of mechanism study. If Takeda exercises this option, we will receive an opt-in payment and will lead manufacturing and joint clinical co-development activities and Takeda will lead joint co-commercial activities in the United States and all commercial activities outside of the United States. Global costs and potential profits will be shared 50:50 and we will be eligible to receive development and commercial milestone payments. In addition to its 50% profit share, we are eligible to receive option exercise fees and development and commercial milestone payments for each of the Category 1 Programs.
 Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, each party grants to the other party specific intellectual property licenses to enable the other party to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, including license grants to enable each party to conduct research, development and commercialization activities pursuant to the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.
 The term of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement commenced on April 2, 2018 and, unless terminated earlier, will continue until the date on which: (i) with respect to each Category 1 Program target for which Takeda does not exercise its option, the expiration or termination of the development program with respect to such target; or (ii) with respect to each Category 1 Program target for which Takeda exercises its option, the date on which neither party is researching, developing or manufacturing any products or companion diagnostics directed to such target.
 32

Takeda may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement for convenience on 180 days’ notice, in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis. Subject to certain exceptions, each party has the right to terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement on a target-by-target basis if the other party, or a third party related to such party, challenges the patentability, enforceability or validity of any patents within the licensed technology that cover any product or companion diagnostic that is subject to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. In the event of any material breach of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement by a party, subject to cure rights, the other party may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in its entirety if the breach relates to all targets or on a target-by-target basis if the breach relates to a specific target. In the event that Takeda and its affiliates cease development, manufacturing and commercialization activities with respect to compounds or products subject to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement and directed to a particular target, we may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with respect to such target. Either party may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement for the other party’s insolvency. In certain termination circumstances, we would receive a license from Takeda to continue researching, developing and manufacturing certain products, and companion diagnostics.
 Asuragen 
 
In November 2019, we entered into an agreement with Asuragen, Inc. (which was acquired by Bio-Techne Corporation on April 6, 2021) (“Asuragen”), a molecular diagnostics company, for the development and potential commercialization of companion diagnostics for our investigational allele-selective therapeutic programs targeting HD. This collaboration uses Asuragen’s market-leading repetitive sequence diagnostic expertise to provide scalable SNP phasing to support global development programs and future commercialization at a global level. Asuragen has leveraged its AmplideX® PCR technology to develop companion diagnostic tests designed to size and phase HTT CAG repeats with the SNPs targeted by our previous investigational therapeutic programs in HD, as well as WVE-003, our current HD program being investigated in the ongoing SELECT-HD clinical trial. These tests are designed to aid clinicians in selecting HD patients by identifying the SNPs that are in phase with the CAG-expanded allele.

Manufacturing 
 To provide internal cGMP manufacturing capabilities and increase control and visibility of our drug product supply chain, we entered into a lease in September 2016 for a multi-use facility of approximately 90,000 square feet in Lexington, Massachusetts and initiated the build out of manufacturing space and related capabilities. Through our internal manufacturing, we have the capacity to support multiple discovery-, preclinical-, and early clinical-stage programs and have the established expertise to efficiently conduct manufacturing runs for oligonucleotides across a spectrum of modalities. In addition to manufacturing space, the Lexington facility includes additional laboratory and office space. This facility supplements our existing Cambridge, Massachusetts laboratory and office space headquarters, enhances our ability to secure drug substance for current and future development activities and may provide commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities. In July 2017, we took occupancy of the Lexington facility and began manufacturing production in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 We believe that leveraging our internal manufacturing capabilities along with expertise from CMOs facilitates our growth and enhances our ability to secure drug substance for current and future research, clinical and early-stage commercial development activities. We believe that the addition of our internal cGMP manufacturing capabilities, together with the supply capacity we have established externally, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated manufacturing needs for the next several years. We monitor the availability of capacity for the manufacture of drug substance and drug product and believe that our supply agreements with our contract manufacturers and the lead times for new supply agreements would allow us to access additional capacity if needed. We believe that our product candidates can be manufactured at scale and with production and procurement efficiencies that will result in commercially competitive costs. 
 Intellectual Property
 We believe that we have a strong intellectual property position relating to the development and commercialization of our stereopure oligonucleotides. Our intellectual property portfolio includes filings designed to protect stereopure oligonucleotide compositions generally, as well as filings designed to protect stereopure compositions of oligonucleotides with particular stereochemical patterns (for example, that affect or confer biological activity). Our portfolio also includes filings for both proprietary methods and reagents, as well as various chemical methodologies that enable production of such stereopure oligonucleotide compositions. In addition, our portfolio includes filings designed to protect methods of using stereopure oligonucleotide compositions and filings designed to protect particular stereopure oligonucleotide products, such as those having a particular sequence, pattern of nucleoside and/or backbone modification, pattern of backbone linkages and/or pattern of backbone chiral centers. 
 We own or have rights to worldwide patent filings that protect our proprietary technologies for making stereopure oligonucleotide compositions, and that also protect the compositions themselves, as well as methods of using them, including in the treatment of diseases. Our portfolio includes multiple issued patents, including in major market jurisdictions such as the United States, Europe and Japan.  We also have applications pending in multiple jurisdictions around the world, including these major market jurisdictions. 
 Synthetic Methodologies 
 Our patent portfolio includes multiple families that protect synthetic methodologies and/or reagents for generating stereopure oligonucleotide compositions. Certain synthetic methodologies and/or reagents are covered by families which include two issued Japanese patents that have terms that extend to 2022-2025.  
 Additional synthetic methodologies and/or reagents are protected by other families in our patent portfolio. Certain such families have 20-year expiration dates that range from 2029 to at least 2041. Some of these families have issued patents in several jurisdictions, including in major market jurisdictions such as the United States, Europe, and/or Japan, have pending applications in multiple jurisdictions including in these major market jurisdictions, or are in the international stage. 
 We also co-own with the University of Tokyo certain filings that are directed to certain methods and/or reagents for synthesizing oligonucleotides; their 20-year expiration dates fall in 2031.
 Stereopure Oligonucleotide Compositions
 Certain of our patent filings protect stereopure compositions, particularly of therapeutically relevant oligonucleotides. Some such filings are directed to compositions whose oligonucleotides are characterized by particular patterns of chemical modification (including modifications of bases, sugars and/or internucleotidic linkages) and/or of internucleotidic linkage stereochemistry. Certain patent filings describe specific compositions designed for use in the treatment of particular diseases. Several of our patent filings directed to stereopure compositions have entered national stage prosecution in multiple jurisdictions and some have issued in one or more jurisdictions; others are in the international stage. Certain filings offer 20-year protection terms that range from 2033 to at least 2041. 
 34

We also co-own with Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd. various patent families, some of which include one or more issued patents, including in major market jurisdictions; these filings have 20-year terms extending to 2033-2035. 
 Future Filings 
 We maintain a thoughtful and ambitious program for developing and protecting additional intellectual property, including new synthetic methodologies and reagents. We also intend to prepare and submit patent filings specifically directed to protecting individual product candidates and their uses as we finalize leads and collect relevant data, which is expected to include comparison data confirming novel and/or beneficial attributes of our product candidates. 
Singapore Intellectual Property Law 
 Section 34 of the Patents Act 1994 of Singapore (the “Singapore Patents Act”) provides that a person residing in Singapore is required to obtain written authorization from the Singapore Registrar of Patents (the “Registrar”) before filing an application for a patent for an invention outside of Singapore, unless all of the following conditions have been satisfied: (a) the person has filed an application for a patent for the same invention in the Singapore Registry of Patents at least two months before the filing of the patent application outside Singapore, and (b) the Singapore Registrar of Patents has not, in respect of this patent application, given directions to prohibit or restrict the publication of information contained in the patent application or its communication to any persons or description of persons pursuant to Section 33 of the Singapore Patents Act, or if the Registrar has given any such directions, all such directions have been revoked. A violation of Section 34 is a criminal offense punishable by a fine not exceeding S$5,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both. There have been some instances where we have undertaken filings outside of Singapore, and there may be instances where we are required to make such filings in the future, without first obtaining written authorization from the Registrar. We have notified the Registrar of such filings and we have since implemented measures to address the requirements of Section 34 moving forward. To date, the Registrar has offered a compound of some of the offences considered against payment of a sum of S$50 to S$150 per considered case. Under Singapore law, the Registrar has discretion to offer a compound of such offences against payment of a sum of money of up to S$2,000, or to prosecute the offence subject to the other penalties noted above. Per requests in the Registrar’s most recent decision, we have submitted approximately 140 patent applications in multiple patent families, most of which are related to previously reported applications, to the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (“IPOS”). The IPOS may consider the filing of some or all of these applications to have breached Section 34 requirements per IPOS’ current interpretation of Section 34, and we are waiting for IPOS’ decision on these applications. We cannot assure you that the Registrar will offer to compound any such violations of Section 34, or that any offer to compound will be for an amount similar to previous compound offers.
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical marketplace is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our expertise in oligonucleotides, scientific knowledge and intellectual property estate provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on oligonucleotides, but any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Huntington’s Disease 
 There are no approved treatments available to slow the progression of HD. We believe, based on publicly available information, that Annexon Biosciences (Phase 2), Ionis Pharmaceuticals and Roche (Phase 2 planned), Mitochon Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2), Novartis (Phase 2), Prilenia Therapeutics (Phase 3), PTC Therapeutics (Phase 1), and uniQure (Phase 1/2) all have investigational drugs in clinical development. 
 Several companies have ongoing discovery or preclinical programs for HD, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, AskBio, Atalanta Therapeutics and Biogen, Avergen Pharmaceuticals, LocanaBio, Mitoconix Bio, NeuBase Therapeutics, Neurimmune, Ophidion, PTC Therapeutics, Sangamo Therapeutics and Takeda, Spark Therapeutics, Triplet Therapeutics, Vico, and Voyager Therapeutics, among others.
 35

A number of companies are developing molecules to treat symptoms associated with HD, including Azevan Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2), Neurocrine Biosciences (Phase 3), Sage Therapeutics (Phase 1), and SOM Biotech (Phase 2), among others. 
 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia
 There are two treatments approved in the United States for the treatment of ALS: riluzole, approved in 1995, and edaravone, approved in 2017. There are a number of companies with potential therapeutics for the treatment of ALS in clinical development, including AB Science (Phase 3), Alector (Phase 2), Amylyx Pharmaceuticals (Pre-registration), Biogen (Phase 1 completed), Biohaven Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2/3), BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics (Phase 3 completed), Prilenia (Phase 2/3), and UCB (Phase 2/3), among others. We believe that two companies, Biogen (Phase 1 completed) and Alector (Phase 2), are conducting clinical trials targeting ALS due to a C9orf72 mutation in the United States.
 Several companies have ongoing discovery or preclinical programs for ALS that may directly or indirectly target patients with the C9orf72 mutation, including AGTC, Apic Bio, Biogen and Neurimmune, Locana Bio, Passage Bio, Pfizer and Sangamo Therapeutics, and uniQure.  
 There are no approved treatments available to slow the progression of FTD. Multiple companies have investigational therapies in clinical development for FTD, including Alector (Phase 3), Anavex (Phase 1 completed), Eli Lilly (Phase 1/2), Passage Bio (Phase 1/2), and TauRx Pharmaceuticals (Phase 3 complete). Alector is studying its investigational therapy for FTD patients with a C9orf72 mutation in a Phase 2 study.
 There are several companies with ongoing discovery or preclinical programs for FTD that may directly or indirectly target patients with the C9orf72 mutation including Biogen and Neurimmune, Locana Bio, Pfizer and Sangamo Therapeutics, and uniQure.
 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
 There are two treatments approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 53 skipping: Sarepta Therapeutics’ Vyondys 53 (golodirsen), an exon skipping nucleic acid therapeutic, was approved by the FDA in 2019, and NS Pharma’s Viltepso (viltolarsen), an exon skipping nucleic acid therapeutic, was approved by the FDA in 2020. Both therapies received accelerated approval, as the FDA concluded that the data submitted by each company demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in some patients with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 53 skipping. No clinical benefit of golodirsen or viltolarsen has been established. Thus, in accordance with the U.S. accelerated approval regulations, the FDA is requiring Sarepta and NS Pharma to each conduct a clinical trial to verify and describe their drug’s clinical benefit. Sarepta’s study of golodirsen would need to assess whether golodirsen improves motor function of DMD patients with a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 53 skipping, and NS Pharma’s study of viltolarsen is designed to assess whether viltolarsen improves the time to stand for DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. If the trials fail to verify clinical benefit, the FDA could initiate proceedings to withdraw approval of the respective drug. 
 Several other companies have investigational drugs in clinical development targeting DMD more broadly, including patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. These include Astellas Pharma (Phase 1), Dystrogen Therapeutics (Phase 1), FibroGen (Phase 3), Pfizer (Phase 3), PTC Therapeutics (Phase 3), Santhera Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2), Sarepta Therapeutics (Phase 3), and Solid Biosciences (Phase 1/2), among others.  Based on available information, we do not believe there are other companies with ongoing clinical programs directly targeting DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. 
 Several companies also have ongoing preclinical programs for DMD that may directly or indirectly target patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. These companies include Astellas, Code Bio, CRISPR Therapeutics, Daiichi Sankyo, Fulcrum Therapeutics, PepGen, Precision BioSciences, REGENXBIO, Sarepta Therapeutics, and Ultragenyx, among others.
 Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (“AATD”)
 There are five treatments approved in the United States for AATD: Prolastin, Prolastin-C, Aralast NP, Zemaira, and Glassia. All five contain plasma-derived human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor and are indicated for chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy in adults with emphysema due to congenital deficiency of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (Alpha1-PI). The prescribing information for each notes that the effect of augmentation therapy with any alpha1-proteinase inhibitor on pulmonary exacerbations and on the progression of emphysema in Alpha1-PI deficiency has not been demonstrated in randomized, controlled clinical trials.
 There are also a number of companies with investigational drugs in clinical development: Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals and Takeda (Phase 2), Centessa (Phase 1), Dicerna Pharmaceuticals and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2), InhibRx (Phase 1), Kamada (Phase 3), Mereo BioPharma (Phase 2), and Santhera Pharmacauticals (Phase 1).
 36

There are also several companies with ongoing discovery or preclinical programs for AATD including Apic Bio, Beam Therapeutics, Biomarin, Intellia Therapeutics, KorroBio, Krystal Biotech, LogicBio Therapeutics, Shape Therapeutics, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, among others.
 ADAR-mediated RNA Editing (“ADAR editing”)
 There are several companies pursuing editing approaches that may compete with our ADAR editing modality. These companies are in various stages of development (discovery through the clinic) and are developing investigational drugs via viral and non-viral delivery for RNA editing (Shape Therapeutics and Korro Bio), DNA base-editing (Beam), and DNA editing (Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, and Sangamo Therapeutics), among others. These companies may leverage these approaches to target the same indications that we intend to target or indications where we do not currently plan to compete. 
 Government Regulation
 FDA Approval Process for Drug Products
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a pharmaceutical company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of drug products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of drug products from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 FDA approval is required before any new drug, such as a new molecular or chemical entity, or a new dosage form, new use or new route of administration of a previously approved product, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing in compliance with applicable FDA good laboratory practice regulations and other requirements (“GLP”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each site where a clinical trial will be performed before the trial may be initiated at that site;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) to establish safety and substantial evidence of effectiveness of the proposed product candidate for each intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | thorough characterization of the product candidate and establishment of acceptable standards to assure its purity, identity, strength, quality and stability in compliance with cGMP;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with cGMP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of one or more clinical trial site(s) or the sponsor’s site and/or contract research organization responsible for conduct of key clinical trials in accordance with GCP;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”), which must be accepted for filing by the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The manufacturing development, preclinical and clinical testing, and review process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Manufacturing development includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, development of manufacturing and control procedures, evaluation of stability, and the establishment of procedures to ensure continued product quality.
 Nonclinical tests include in vitro and in vivo animal studies to assess the toxicity and other safety characteristics of the product candidate, as well as other important aspects of drug pharmacology. The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. 
 37

Some long-term nonclinical testing to further establish the safety profile of the product candidate, as well as manufacturing processes development and drug quality evaluation, continues after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trial and places the IND on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve all outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, or if changes are made in trial design. Even if the IND becomes effective and the trial proceeds without initial FDA objection, the FDA may stop the trial at a later time if it has concerns, such as if unacceptable safety risks arise. 
 Further, an IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must perform an ongoing review of the research on an annual basis until the trial is completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trials are not being conducted in accordance with the clinical plan or in compliance with GCP. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products generally must register and disclose certain clinical trial information to a public registry maintained by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”). In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Although sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion, disclosure of the results can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Failure to timely register a covered clinical study or to submit study results as provided for in the law can give rise to civil monetary penalties and also prevent the non-compliant party from receiving future grant funds from the federal government. The NIH’s Final Rule on ClinicalTrials.gov registration and reporting requirements became effective in 2017, and the government has recently begun enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to obtain substantial, statistical evidence of clinical efficacy and safety, generally at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product and to provide adequate information for approval of the product.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing progress and safety data gathered from clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Safety reports are submitted more frequently if certain serious adverse effects (“SAEs”) occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted as part of NDA review. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of most clinical trials after completion, although in some cases disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years after the trial completion date. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including 
 38

studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. Under federal law, the fee for the submission of an NDA with clinical data is substantial (for example, for fiscal year 2022 this application fee exceeds $3.1 million), and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently more than $360,000 per program. These fees are typically adjusted annually, but exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances, including NDA fees for products with orphan designation.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. Any resubmitted application, following a refusal to file action, is also subject to 60-day review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), for original NDAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. For all new molecular entity (“NME”) NDAs, the ten and six-month time periods run from the filing date; for all other original applications, the ten and six-month time periods run from the submission date. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an NDA to extend beyond the goal date. 
 Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. As noted above, the FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date it is accepted for filing (i.e., 12 months), and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months from the date the application is accepted for filing (i.e., 8 months). The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP. The FDA may also inspect one or more of the clinical sites where pivotal trials were conducted and the contract research organization facilities with oversight of the trial, in order to ensure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the study data.
 Additionally, the FDA may refer any NDA, including applications for novel biologic candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making final decisions on approval. The FDA likely will re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the drug or biological product. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve an NDA without a REMS, if required.
 In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA may consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is an NME. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval, or at a later date should significant new risk information come to light. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use that the FDA deems necessary to assure the benefits of use of the drug outweigh its risks. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy, often at 18 months, 3 years, and 7 years after the strategy’s approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric population for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. PREA requires a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”) within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 clinical trial. The initial PSP must include an outline 
 39

of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs.

The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application will not be approved in its present form. CRLs outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may choose to either resubmit the NDA or NDA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. 
 The FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label and, even if the FDA approves a product, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms, such as a Boxed Warning, which highlights a serious safety concern that should be mitigated under a REMS program. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, a company is generally required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a supplemental NDA, which may require the company to develop additional data or conduct additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. In addition, fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the clinical trial process.
 In addition, in 2012 Congress created a new regulatory program for product candidates designated by FDA as “breakthrough therapies” upon a request made by the IND sponsors. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval of their respective marketing applications. The FDA must take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing advice to the product sponsor, which are intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug or biologic that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over existing therapy. The FDA determines at the time that the 
 40

marketing application is submitted, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months for an NME NDA from the date of filing.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process. 
 Accelerated Approval Pathway
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval from the FDA and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug or biologic when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”) and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA will require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures. Drugs and biologics granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate long-term clinical benefit of a drug.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to establish the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug. All promotional materials for product candidates being considered and approved under the accelerated approval program are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to safety surveillance and adverse event reporting, periodic reporting, continued cGMP compliance and quality oversight, compliance with post-marketing commitments, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, and reporting manufacturing and labeling changes, as applicable. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs (including third-party manufacturers) are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for assessment of compliance with cGMP. Changes to the 
 41

manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction, and sometimes notification of, any deviations from cGMP. These regulations impose reporting and documentation requirements on the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unlisted severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as noncompliance with cGMP or failure to correct previously identified inspection findings, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | issuance of field alerts, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, product recalls, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or holds on clinical trials using the product or other products manufactured at the same facility;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions, consent decrees, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. While physicians may generally prescribe a drug for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote the drug in accordance with the approved product label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have promoted false and misleading information about the product may be subject to significant liability, both at the federal and state levels. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”) which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription drug product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Most recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”) was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10‑year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined as one affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more than 200,000 individuals where there is no reasonable expectation that the product development cost will be recovered from product sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether a drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 Under PREA, submission of a pediatric assessment is not required for pediatric investigation of a product that has been granted orphan drug designation. However, under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (“FDASIA”), the scope of the PREA was extended to require pediatric studies for products intended for the treatment of an adult cancer that are directed at a molecular target that are determined to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. In addition, the FDA finalized guidance in 2018 indicating that it does not expect to grant any additional orphan drug designation to products for pediatric subpopulations of common diseases. Nevertheless, the FDA intends to still grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic that otherwise meets all other criteria for 
 42

designation when it prevents, diagnoses or treats either (i) a rare disease that includes a rare pediatric subpopulation, (ii) a pediatric subpopulation that constitutes a valid orphan subset, or (iii) a rare disease that is in fact a different disease in the pediatric population as compared to the adult population.
 If an orphan drug-designated product subsequently receives FDA approval for the disease for which it was designed, the product will be entitled to seven years of product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances (such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues), for seven years. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug or biologic for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug or biologic for different conditions. If a competitor obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, or if our product candidate is determined to be the same drug as a competitor’s product for the same indication or disease, the competitor’s exclusivity could block the approval of our product candidate in the designated orphan indication for seven years, unless our product is demonstrated to be clinically superior to the competitor’s drug. 
 European Union Orphan Drug Designation 
 In the European Union (the “EU”), orphan drug designation by the European Commission (the “EC”) provides regulatory and financial incentives for companies to develop and market therapies that meet the following requirements: (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. To be considered for orphan drug designation in the EU, companies must provide data that demonstrate the plausibility for use of the investigational therapy in the treatment of the disease and establish that the drug has the potential to provide relevant advantages or a major contribution to patient care over existing therapies.
 Among the incentives available to medicines designated as orphan drugs by the EC are ten-year market exclusivity in the EU after product approval, eligibility for conditional marketing authorization, protocol assistance from the European Medicines Agency at reduced fees during the product development phase and direct access to centralized marketing authorization in the EU. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In addition, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the product. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is deemed safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation does not, in itself, convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and authorization process.
 Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides NDA holders a six-month period of non-patent marketing exclusivity attached to any other exclusivity listed with FDA—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for pediatric exclusivity include a determination by the FDA that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population; a written request by the FDA for pediatric studies; and agreement by the applicant to perform the requested studies and the submission to the FDA, completion of the studies in accordance with the written request, and the acceptance by the FDA, of the reports of the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications.
The Hatch-Waxman Act and Marketing Exclusivity
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute and also enacted Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug (“RLD”). Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be 
 43

approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug.
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity. During the exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for review any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed on an NCE patent and any time after approval if the application is filed based on a new indication or a new formulation.
 The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving follow-on applications for drugs containing the original active agent. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Five-year and three-year exclusivity also will not delay the submission or approval of a traditional NDA filed under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. However, an applicant submitting a traditional NDA would be required to either conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Patent Term Restoration 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our therapeutic candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for any patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 
In Vitro Diagnostic Tests for Biomarkers
 For some of our product candidates, we plan to work with collaborators to develop or obtain access to in vitro companion diagnostic tests to identify appropriate patients for these targeted therapies. If a sponsor or the FDA believes that a diagnostic test is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product, a sponsor will typically work with a collaborator to develop an in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”). IVDs are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, and since 2014 the agency has issued final and draft guidance documents that are intended to assist companies developing in vitro companion diagnostic devices and companies developing therapeutic products that depend on the use of a specific in vitro companion diagnostic for the safe and effective use of the product. 
 The three types of marketing pathways for medical devices are clearance of a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA (“510(k)”), approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”) and a de novo classification request, or de novo. If a company is required to perform clinical trials to support the safety and effectiveness of an IVD, and the IVD is viewed as a significant risk device, the sponsor will have to submit an investigational device exemption application (“IDE”) to the FDA, which is similar in format and function to an IND. If the diagnostic test and the therapeutic drug are studied together to support their respective approvals, any clinical trials involving both product candidates must meet both the IDE and IND requirements. 
 The FDA expects that the therapeutic sponsor will address the need for an IVD companion diagnostic device in its therapeutic product development plan and that, in most cases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding IVD companion diagnostic device will be developed contemporaneously. If the companion diagnostic test will be used to make critical treatment decisions such as patient selection, treatment assignment, or treatment arm, it will likely be considered a significant risk device for which a clinical trial will be required. After approval, the use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product will be stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product. In addition, a diagnostic 
 44

test that was approved through the PMA process, or one that was cleared through the 510(k) process or reclassified through the de novo process, and placed on the market will be subject to many of the same regulatory requirements that apply to approved drugs.
 However, the FDA may decide that it is appropriate to approve such a therapeutic product without an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device when the drug or therapeutic biologic is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition for which no satisfactory alternative treatment exists and the FDA determines that the benefits from the use of a product with an unapproved or uncleared in vitro companion diagnostic device are so pronounced as to outweigh the risks from the lack of an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device. The FDA encourages sponsors considering developing a therapeutic product that requires a companion diagnostic to request a meeting with both relevant device and therapeutic product review divisions to ensure that the product development plan will produce sufficient data to establish the safety and effectiveness of both the therapeutic product and the companion diagnostic. Because the FDA’s policies on companion diagnostics is set forth only in guidance, this policy is subject to change and is not legally binding.
 European Union Regulation of Drug Products
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials, the privacy of personal data and commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application (“CTA”), must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company plans to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trials may proceed in that country. Under the EU Clinical Trials Regulation, a harmonized assessment and supervision processes was implemented as of January 31, 2022 for clinical trials throughout the EU, via a Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”). The CTIS will contain the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials conducted in the EU and will allow for a centralized review process.  This harmonized submission process became mandatory for new CTA submissions to be filed beginning on February 1, 2023.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country, even though there is already some degree of legal harmonization in the EU member states resulting from the national implementation of underlying EU legislation. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.
 To obtain a marketing license for a new drug or medicinal product in the European Union, the sponsor must obtain approval of a marketing authorization application (“MAA”). The way in which a medicinal product can be approved in the European Union depends on the nature of the medicinal product. As of January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“UK”) is no longer a member state of the EU, and therefore a separate MAA and approval will be required to market a medicinal product in the UK. The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has issued guidance regarding the requirements for licensing and marketing therapeutic drugs and biologics post-Brexit.
 The centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the European Union, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated “orphan drugs” (drugs used for rare human diseases) and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used for human drugs which do not fall within the above mentioned categories if the human drug (a) contains a new active substance which was not authorized in the European Community; or (b) the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization in the centralized procedure is in the interests of patients or animal health at the European Community level.
 Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”)), with adoption of the actual marketing authorization by the European Commission thereafter. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point of view of therapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated; the absence of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach, and anticipation of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days and the opinion issued thereafter.
 45

The mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”) for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the European Union. Basically, the MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products, and is based on the principle of recognition of an already existing national marketing authorization by one or more member states. In the MRP, a marketing authorization for a drug already exists in one or more member states of the European Union and subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other European Union member states by referring to the initial marketing authorization. The member state in which the marketing authorization was first granted will then act as the reference member state. The member states where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for act as concerned member states. After a product assessment is completed by the reference member state, copies of the report are sent to all member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then have 90 days to recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations within individual member states shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement
 Should any member state refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the issue will be referred to a coordination group. Within a timeframe of 60 days, member states shall, within the coordination group, make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA committee is then forwarded to the Commission, for the start of the decision-making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products or Veterinary Medicinal Products, as appropriate.
 Rest of World Government Regulation
 For countries outside of the United States and the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, if our product candidates are approved in the United States, we will have to comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws, rules and regulations. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These laws include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 46

 
• | the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners and physician ownership and investment interests; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical or medical device companies to comply with the relevant industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures.
 In November 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) finalized significant changes to the regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute, as well as the civil monetary penalty rules regarding beneficiary inducements, with the goal of offering the healthcare industry more flexibility and reducing the regulatory burden associated with those fraud and abuse laws, particularly with respect to value-based arrangements among industry participants. 
 State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. We also are subject to, or may in the future become subject to, U.S. federal and state, and foreign laws and regulations imposing obligations on how we collect, use, disclose, store and process personal information. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could result in liability or reputational harm and could harm our business.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing in the United States, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. In addition, these third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. Furthermore, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Limited third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In Europe and other countries outside of the United States, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed to. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. In some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product and therapeutic candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product and therapeutic candidates that obtain marketing approval. The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product and therapeutic candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. 
 47

For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), was enacted in March 2010 and has had a significant impact on the health care industry in the United States. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. Additionally, on December 20, 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 was signed into law (P.L. 116-94) and includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 or the “CREATES Act.” The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic product developers need samples to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on “commercially reasonable, market-based terms.” Whether and how generic product developments will use this new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on any of our future commercial products are unknown.
 Since the enactment of the ACA, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or have been effectively repealed through Executive Orders and/or executive agency actions. However, following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the ACA’s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although the Biden Administration has signaled that it plans to build on the ACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for health insurance subsidies under it. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect the biopharmaceutical industry as a whole or our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices, and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry in the United States. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA that affect health care expenditures. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 cancellation. The suspension was subsequently extended through March 31, 2022, with a reduction of the suspension to 1% sequester through June 30, 2022. 
 Moreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. DHHS has solicited feedback on some of the various measures intended to lower drug prices and reduce the out of pocket costs of drugs and implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, DHHS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified a DHHS policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. 
 Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers (“PBMs”) and other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area.
 We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, including any future drug products for which we secure marketing approval.

Manufacturing Requirements 
 We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable cGMP requirements. The cGMP requirements include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture commercial products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic announced or for-cause unannounced inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our commercial products, if any, to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning or other enforcement letters, voluntary corrective action, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, disgorgement of profits, and other civil and criminal penalties. 
Other Regulatory Requirements 
 We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement authority, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and generate revenues. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 
Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed 238 employees, of which 235 were full-time employees. A significant number of our management and professional employees have had prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers relations with our employees to be good. 
 Our approach to how we recruit, develop, retain and manage our talent is driven by our values statement: Making an impact through innovation, inclusion, and inspiration. Our values are at the core of who we are as an organization, and what drive us to envision a brighter future for the patients and families we serve. Critical to achieving our strategic imperatives is our ability to build a world-class organization and retain an exceptional team in which each member plays a unique and important role. We value diversity, inclusion, and social responsibility where our employees have a strong sense of belonging and contributing, while being empowered to make a real difference.  In 2021, we updated our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter to reflect the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s oversight of our strategies and policies related to our people and diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”), in addition to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s oversight of our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) strategy, initiatives and policies. 
 We recognize that maintaining an engaged and high-performing workforce who share a connection with the communities we serve is critical to our success. Comradery and cohesion are at the core of who we are as a company, and are integral facets of our human capital strategy. Whether it is coming together throughout the year to connect at our town halls or participating in a global fitness challenge to support the health and well-being of our employees, we take a team approach to our work. We are inspired by each other and the possibilities of what we can achieve together. 
 We understand that in order to drive innovation, we must continuously improve our people strategies and find ways to foster engagement and growth within our organization. To this end, below are some of our initiatives:
 Employee Engagement: We embrace the idea that our employees do their best work when they have equity ownership in the business.  Having an engaged and dedicated workforce is essential for us to achieve our goals. Employee engagement ensures that our employees feel passionate about the work they are doing, and with this commitment, we recognize that this is when results happen. It is more apparent than ever that we are all in this together, and as a company, we need to set up our employees for success and continue to cultivate their engagement with our company. We regularly conduct surveys as a means of engaging with employees and gaining their insights. We use the data and input as a tool for improving our human resources management going forward. Engagement is also directly correlated to the interactions our employees have with each other and their teams. Our Wave Activities Committee is a cross-functional team dedicated to organizing activities, such as themed social gatherings, charity and volunteer opportunities, and health and wellness events, which enrich our culture and bring employees together. We also work to ensure that we are deeply aligned with our corporate goals as a company, that functional goals are clear and transparent, and that employees understand how their work contributes to the company’s success.
 49

Employee Health and Safety:  Compliance with environmental, health and safety (“EH&S”) laws and regulations forms the basis of the EH&S policy and programs we have in place, which include occupational health and safety measures that apply to all of our employees, contractors and visitors. These programs detail the proactive, risk-based approach that we take to prevent workplace injuries and protect the health and safety of our employees and the communities around us. We have implemented an EH&S management system to monitor and track the effectiveness of our programs, ensure EH&S compliance, respond to incidents and manage corrective actions to reinforce safeguards. Our training programs provide training to our employees that is commensurate with their level of risk exposure and are designed to ensure that employees have the knowledge and equipment available to mitigate risk. Our cross-functional Safety Committee meets monthly to discuss any concerns and ways to improve our EH&S programs. Employees are also required to report any incidents, no matter how small, and are encouraged to voice any health or safety concerns to management or a member of our EH&S team. As we continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation, we have implemented and will continue to implement measures designed to safeguard the health and safety of our employees and our patients, including COVID-19 testing. We formed a COVID-19 response team, a business continuity planning team and a “future of work” team that is continuously evaluating the guidance from federal and local authorities and has created polices and guidelines that continue to ensure our employees’ health and safety comes first. In October 2021, we implemented a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy.
 Professional Development Programs and Opportunities: Employees are our most valuable resource, and we aspire to provide them with opportunities so that they can continue to grow and excel in their functions and our company. Professional growth of our employees leads to engagement and development, and allows us to leverage opportunities to hire and promote key talent from within our organization. We have also implemented a personal development plan program, and leadership and management development programs. Through development planning, we strive for employees at all levels to focus on strengthening the skills required in their current role and potentially their next role. We conduct annual performance reviews for all employees, but, as importantly, we are focused on building a culture of continuous coaching, feedback and open communication between managers and their direct reports throughout the entire year. We provide managers and employees with training on how to conduct effective forward-looking performance conversations and to set effective goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timebound (SMART). We provide our employees with unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning, to advance their professional development, interests and goals. Another example where we provide company-wide leadership and development opportunities is through the Wave Learning Series, which was developed to build awareness of all functional areas, special areas of interest or importance, timely subject matters and to expand knowledge of industry trends and other matters of interest and relevance within the biopharmaceutical industry. The Wave Learning Series is conducted through company-wide presentations by employees at various levels, providing opportunities for development and cross-functional exposure for our employees. To further assist our employees, we also offer all full-time employees the option to participate in our Education Assistance Program, where we reimburse employees for tuition and eligible expenses.
 Health and Well-Being: We believe that the overall well-being of our employees and ensuring that their basic health and wellness needs are met, is fundamental for us to achieve success as a company. In our ongoing efforts to prioritize wellness initiatives, we understand that a key part of this includes providing our employees with access to mental health, behavioral health, and/or substance abuse services through our medical plans. We provide an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”), as a cost-free benefit, which is available to help employees and their household members confidentially manage everyday life, work challenges, stress, and other personal issues, by providing consultation, referrals and resources, along with ongoing webinars on various work-life, mental health and wellness topics for employees.  In addition, we understand that workplace flexibility is an important component to our employees’ well-being. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, safeguarding employee and patient health has been our top priority, as we advance our business through the research and development of our therapeutic candidates. During the height of the pandemic, we implemented procedures to protect our workforce in manufacturing and laboratory operations, which included mandating a work-from-home policy for most employees. Prioritizing employee safety while achieving our goals has provided us with a greater appreciation for workplace flexibility, which keeps our employees engaged and motivated, while also creating a sense of trust throughout our organization.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”): Our commitment to maintaining a top-performing company means investing in and creating ongoing opportunities for employee development in a diverse and inclusive workplace. We provide equal employment opportunities without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics. In 2021, we formalized our DEI efforts through various initiatives, including the formation of a DEI Steering Group to be more intentional about creating and maintaining a diverse, inclusive, equitable, culturally competent and supportive environment for all of our employees and stakeholders. Some of our preliminary DEI initiatives include creating opportunities for our employees to be engaged with our DEI initiatives through participation in a cultural assessment survey and implementing a DEI strategy with short-, medium- and long-term goals. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce positively impacts our performance, fosters innovation and inspires us to achieve greater results.  In addition to this, our intentional focus on DEI continues to strengthen our culture and helps ensure that we continue to cultivate an effective next generation of experienced leaders and managers necessary to execute on our mission and plans for ambitious growth. Hiring for diversity of thought, background and experience, and diversity of personal characteristics such as gender, race and ethnicity, among many others, is intentional, and continues to be an area of focus for us as we build and grow our workforce. Despite the historical lack of institutional emphasis on the importance of girls and women focusing on education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (“STEM”) and the resulting disproportionate occupation by men in the STEM-educated talent pool, we have prioritized and hired a gender diverse workforce. As of December 31, 2021, women made up approximately 52% of our global workforce and constitute approximately 49% of management (defined as director level and above). We are also committed to building a racially and ethnically diverse workforce. As of December 31, 2021, racially diverse employees (those self-
 50

identifying as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, or being of two or more races) make up approximately 36% of our global workforce and approximately 30% of management (22% of our employees did not provide us with this information).  In addition, we continue to partner with Project Onramp, which is an organization that is working to bridge the opportunity gap for Massachusetts college students in underserved and minority communities. Through this partnership, we provide students with summer internships.
 Community Outreach and Engagement: Our community engagement activities are focused on seeking to better understand the lives of people living with rare disease and identifying opportunities to support the rare disease community. We believe that partnering with, and understanding the lives of patients and their families and caregivers, differentiates us and enhances our ability to discover and develop potential therapies. Through collaboration with patients, families and advocacy organizations, face-to-face meetings, and participation in patient-focused conferences and community events, we aim to broaden our understanding of the needs of patients and families and incorporate those critical learnings into every aspect of our company. These insights inform the design and execution of our clinical trials, the enrichment of our corporate culture, and the development of programs and services that make a positive impact on people’s lives. Employee volunteerism is another important component of our community engagement initiatives. We partner with advocacy and service organizations to provide opportunities for employees to contribute directly to our local communities, including through our Wave Service Day. By participating in a broad range of volunteer activities, our employees donate time and resources to support patients and families in the rare disease community and beyond.
 Rewards and Recognition: We have a multi-tiered awards program, including peer-to-peer recognition, which our employees use to recognize and reward one another for their contributions and achievements, taking into consideration the combination of employees who best exemplify our values and the achievement of results. We believe that providing a rewards program not only increases engagement and performance, but meaningfully recognizes those employees who go above and beyond to positively impact our company and culture.  In 2021, we developed a team rewards and recognition program to provide another opportunity to recognize and reward collaborative teamwork.
 Compensation, Equity and Benefits (Total Rewards): Compensation programs are one of the most powerful tools available to companies to attract, retain and motivate employees, as well as align their interests with those of shareholders.  We have designed a broad-based compensation program that is designed to attract, retain and motivate our employees, while driving sustainable long-term value creation. We seek to deliver performance-driven, market competitive reward opportunities commensurate with company and individual performance.  All of our employees receive competitive base salaries, cash bonuses, new hire equity grants and annual long-term incentive grants, in addition to our generous benefits package. We believe that providing employees with an ownership interest in our company through grants of equity awards, further strengthens the level of employee engagement. Furthermore, equity awards help align the interests of our employees with the long-term interests of our shareholders.  In addition, we have an Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which provides our employees with an opportunity to purchase shares of our Company at a 15% discount to the market price. 
 Offering a highly competitive, industry-leading, benefits package is another integral piece of our total rewards package and differentiated employee value proposition. Notably, we provide our employees with access to choice and offer employees a very progressive health insurance package, with no premiums. We also offer a 401(k) plan with matching contributions for all eligible employees. We were named a best-in-class employer, scoring in the top quartile of large and midsize employers who participated in Gallagher’s 2021 Benefits Strategy & Benchmarking Survey. We were recognized for providing innovative solutions that are key to attracting, engaging and motivating employees, including (i) our excellent benefits and compensation programs and strategies; (ii) our employee well-being approach and strategy; (iii) our health plan and how we have managed this over time; and (iv) internal communications and education around our total rewards strategy.
 We will continue to evolve and strengthen our strategies relating to talent, while furthering our investment in our employees, culture, community partnerships and outreach, and other human capital measures.
