Our Markets
 
In the United States, which is our primary market, we sell and distribute interactive educational products for K-12 to both public and private schools, the K-12 education sector represents one of the largest industry segments. In addition to its size, the U.S. K-12 education market is highly decentralized and is characterized by complex content adoption processes. The sector is comprised of approximately 15,600 public school districts across the 50 states and 132,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools. We believe this market structure underscores the importance of scale and industry relationships and the need for broad, diverse coverage across states, districts and schools. Even while we believe certain initiatives in the education sector, such as the Common Core State Standards, a set of shared math and literacy standards benchmarked to international standards, have increased standardization in K-12 education content, we believe significant state standard specific customization still exists, and we believe the need to address customization provides an ongoing need for companies in the sector to maintain relationships with individual state and district policymakers and expertise in state-varying academic standards.
 
U.S. K-12 education has come under significant political scrutiny in recent years, due to the recognition of its importance to U.S. society at large and concern over the perceived decline in U.S. student competitiveness relative to international peers. An independent task force report published in March 2012 by the Council on Foreign Relations, a non-partisan membership organization and think tank, observed that American students rank far behind global leaders in international tests of literacy, math and science, concluding that the current state of U.S. education severely impairs the United States’ economic, military and diplomatic security as well as broader components of America’s global leadership. Also, the Executive Office of the President Council of Economic Advisors, in a report titled Unleashing the Potential of Educational Technology, stated that “many observers are concerned about declines in the relative quality of U.S. primary and secondary education, and improving performance of our schools has become a national priority.” We believe that the customization of learning programs could enhance innovative and growth strategies geared towards student performance in our nation’s schools.


The global education industry is undergoing a significant transition, as primary and secondary school districts, colleges and universities, as well as governments, corporations and individuals around the world are increasingly recognizing the importance of using technology to more effectively provide information to educate students and other users.


According to “All Global Market Education & Learning”, an industry publication, the market for hardware products is growing due to increases in the use of interactive whiteboards and simulation-based learning hardware. Educational institutions have become more receptive to the implementation of hi-tech learning tools. The advent of technology in the classroom has enabled multi-modal training and varying curricula. In general, technology based tools help develop student performance when integrated with the curriculum. The constant progression of technology in education has helped educators to create classroom experiences that are interactive, developed and collaborative.
 
According to market research report “Markets and Markets Interactive Projector Market” 2016 research report, the interactive projector market was valued at $670 million in 2015 and is expected to reach $2,602 million by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 21.5% between 2016 and 2022. The increasing adoption of interactive projectors in the education segment, the low cost of interactive projectors compared to interactive whiteboards, and significant advantages of interactive projectors over conventional projectors are some of the factors that are driving the growth of the interactive market. Low awareness of the consumers regarding interactive projectors in developing countries restrains the growth of the market in those areas. The major players in the interactive projector market include Seiko Epson Corp. (Japan), BenQ Corp. (Taiwan), Boxlight (U.S.), Dell Technologies Inc. (U.S.), Panasonic Corp. (Japan), CASIO COMPUTER Co., Ltd. (Japan), NEC Display Solutions, Ltd. (Japan), Optoma Technology Inc. (U.S.), Touchjet Inc. (Singapore), and Delta Electronics Inc. (Taiwan).

Our Opportunity
 
We believe that our patented product portfolios and the software and products we intend to develop either alone or in collaboration with other technology companies positions us to be a leading manufacturer and provider of interactive educational products in the global educational and learning market. We believe that increased consumer spending driven by the close connection between levels of educational attainment, evolving standards in curriculum, personal career prospects and economic growth will increase the demand for our interactive educational products. Some of the factors that we believe will impact our opportunity include:
 
Growth in U.S. K-12 Market Expenditures
 
Significant resources are being devoted to primary and secondary education, both in the United States and abroad. As set forth in the Executive Office of the President, Council of Economic Advisers report, U.S. education expenditure has been estimated at approximately $1.3 trillion, with K-12 education accounting for close to half ($625 billion) of this spending. Global spending is roughly triple U.S. spending for K-12 education.
 
While the market has historically grown above the pace of inflation, averaging 7.2% growth annually since 1969, as expenditures by school districts and educational institutions are largely dependent upon state and local funding, the world-wide economic recession caused many states and school districts to defer spending on educational materials, which materially and adversely affected our historical revenues as well as those of many of our competitors. However, expenditures and growth in the U.S. K-12 market for educational content and services now appears to be rebounding in the wake of the U.S. economic recovery. Although, the economic recovery has been slower than anticipated, and there is no assurance that any further improvement will be significant, nonetheless, states such as Florida, California and Texas were all scheduled to adopt interactive educational materials for certain subjects, including reading and math, by 2016.


International Catalysts Driving Adoption of Learning Technology
 
According to Ambient Insights 2012 Snapshot of the Worldwide and US Academic Digital Learning Market, substantial growth in revenues for e-learning products in the academic market segment are anticipated throughout the world due to several convergent catalysts, including population demographics such as significant growth in numbers of 15-17 year old students and women in education in emerging markets; government-funded education policies mandating country-wide deployment of digital learning infrastructures; large scale digitization efforts in government and academic markets; significant increases in the amount of digital learning content; migration to digital formats by major educational publishers and content providers; mass purchases of personal learning devices and strong demand for learning platforms, content and technology services; and rapid growth of part-time and fulltime online student enrollments.
Rising Global Demand
 
We expect to profit from the rising global demand for technology based learning products by offering our interactive product hardware and software in the United States and expanding into foreign countries. In recent years, the global education sector has seen movement towards the adoption of interactive learning devices. As examples:

-


● | In 2010, the Peruvian government spent $3.0 billion for an education technology rollout to provide all teachers and students with individual tablet computers and network infrastructure and classroom displays; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In August 2011, the Russian government announced a plan to deploy tablets, “on a massive scale” in the Russian educational system, to replace printed textbooks; 
● | In October 2011, the Indian government launched its heavily subsidized school-designed tablet called Aakash; and 
● | In July 2011, the Thailand government announced that it intends to give every child in grades 1-6 a tablet starting with first grade students in the 2012 school year. The multi-year program is expected to equip over 5.0 million primary students with handheld devices. 

 
Growth in the E-learning Market
 
According to the “E-learning Market – Global Outlook and Forecast 2018-2023”
 
The introduction of technology-enabled learning that helps organizations train human resource is driving the growth of the global e-learning market. These training modules offer continuous and effective learning at an optimal cost and provide customized course content that meets the specific requirements of end-users. The advent of cloud infrastructure, peer-to-peer problem solving, and open content creation will help to expand business opportunities for service providers in the global e-learning market.
  
Vendors are also focusing on offering choices on the course content at competitive prices to gain the share in the global e-learning market. The exponential growth in the number of smartphone users and internet connectivity across emerging markets is driving the e-learning market in these regions. The introduction of cloud-based learning and AR/VR mobile-based learning is likely to revolutionize the e-learning market during the forecast period.
  
Major vendors are introducing technology-enabled tools that can facilitate the user engagement, motivate learners, and help in collaborations, thereby increasing the market share and attracting new consumers to the market. The growing popularity of blended learning that enhances the efficiency of learners will drive the growth of the e-learning market. The e-learning market is expected to generate revenue of $65.41 billion by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 7.07% during the forecast period.
 
Trends in Tech-Savvy Education
 
While industries from manufacturing to health care have adopted technology to improve their results, according to Stanford Business School, in its Trends in Tech-Savvy Education, the education field remains heavily reliant on “chalk and talk” instruction conducted in traditional settings; however, that is changing as schools and colleges adopt virtual classrooms, data analysis, online games, highly customized coursework, and other cutting-edge tools to help students learn.
 
Demand for Interactive Projectors is on the Rise
 
The interactive projector market was valued at $670.3 million in 2015 and is expected to reach $2.602M by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 21.5% between 2016 and 2022. The factors which are driving the growth of market include significant advantages of interactive projectors over conventional projectors, increased adoption of interactive projectors in the education segment, and the low cost of projectors compared to interactive whiteboards.
 
Additional Technologies
 
The delivery of digital education content is also driving a substantial shift in the education market. In addition to whiteboards, interactive projectors and interactive flat panels, other technologies are being adapted for educational uses on the Internet, mobile devices and through cloud-computing, which permits the sharing of digital files and programs among multiple computers or other devices at the same time through a virtual network. We intend to be a leader in the development and implementation of these additional technologies to create effective digital learning environments.
Handheld Device Adoption
 
Handheld devices, including smartphones, tablets, e-readers and digital video technologies, are now fundamental to the way students communicate. A 2010 FCC survey provides evidence that the rates of handheld use will increase dramatically. It reported that while 50% of respondents currently use handhelds for administrative purposes, 14% of schools and 24% of districts use such devices for academic or educational purposes. Furthermore, 45% of respondents plan to start using such devices for academic and educational purposes within the next 2 to 3 years. The survey stated that, “The use of digital video technologies to support curriculum is becoming increasingly popular as a way to improve student engagement.”
Natural User Interfaces (NUIs)
 
Tablets and the new class of “smart TVs” are part of a growing list of other devices built with natural user interfaces that accept input in the form of taps, swipes, and other ways of touching; hand and arm motions; body movement; and increasingly, natural language. Natural user interfaces allow users to engage in virtual activities with movements similar to what they would use in the real world, manipulating content intuitively. The idea of being able to have a completely natural interaction with a device is not new, but neither has its full potential been realized. For example, medical students increasingly rely on simulators employing natural user interfaces to practice precise manipulations, such as catheter insertions, that would be far less productive if they had to try to simulate sensitive movements with a mouse and keyboard. NUIs make devices seem easier to use and more accessible, and interactions are far more intuitive, which promotes exploration and engagement.

In training centers, we believe that our solutions help to enhance achievement levels with multi-modality (visual, auditory and kinesthetic) learning capabilities, improved interactivity and engagement and real-time assessment and feedback. Our solutions may also help improve an enterprise’s return on investment by providing better trained employees reducing training time and getting employees back to their jobs, reduced travel expenses, improved customers service from well-trained employees and reduced employee turnover.
 
Federal and State Funding According to “State of the K-12 Market Reports 2016” 
 
New Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grant (SSAEG) dollars will likely begin to expand the market somewhat in the 2017-2018 school year. SSAEG is a new funding mechanism that provides flexible funding focused on efforts to promote a well-rounded education, create safe and healthy learning environments for students, and support the effective use of technology. Congress initially authorized SSAEG at $1.6 billion.
 
Despite the attention paid to the federal education budget, school funding continues to come primarily from state and local sources. For the 2014-2015 school year, state funding provided nearly half (46%) of total funding for K-12 schools, with local funding providing 44% of K-12 funding. The federal contribution was an average of 10%. Overall funding for all public and private K-12 education in the United States is currently about $665 billion.
 
States spend a significant amount of their overall budgets to support education. According to the National Association of State Budget Officers, states devote 20% of their overall spending to K-12 education. In FY2016, 41 states enacted spending increases for K-12 education resulting in a net increase of $14.7 billion, up from an $11.1 billion increase in FY2015. Thirty-five states also enacted spending increases for higher education. Only four states—Alaska, Hawaii, West Virginia, and Wisconsin—cut K-12 spending in FY2016.
 
Governors in 43 states called for higher spending in their FY2017 budget recommendations. As has been true for several years, governors’ proposed budgets direct most additional dollars to K-12 funding and Medicaid, the two largest areas of state general fund expenditures.
 
The Fiscal Survey of States, Spring 2016 confirms that state budgets continue to show moderate growth and stability. FY2016 (July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016) marked the first time that aggregate spending levels surpassed the pre-recession peak level of FY2008, adjusted for inflation. For the most part, states have been able to close budget gaps and minimize mid-year budget cuts. Unemployment rates are going down, rainy day funds are growing, and states are focused on resolving issues around unfunded pension programs, ongoing health care and education costs, and pent-up infrastructure demand. Enacted 2016 budgets showed state revenues reaching $798 billion, an increase of 4%, compared with the 3% gain in fiscal 2015, when revenues stood at $748 billion. Revenue growth was widespread: 43 states enacted spending increases in FY2016, compared with 2015 levels. A small number of states face revenue shortfalls brought on by the decline in oil and natural gas prices.


Technology Budget Outlook Per “State of the K-12 Market Reports 2016”
 
The outlook for district technology budgets in the 2016-2017 school year continues the improvement seen last year, confirming schools’ emergence from the long shadow of the recession. Tech directors generally have quite positive expectations about their 2016-2017 budget. Compared with the prior two years, the 2016-2017 outlook is generally strong. Clearly technology directors are making some trade-offs from year to year, increasing spending in one category and balancing that increase by holding steady or slightly decreasing other categories.
 
Even in the schools’ worst recession years of 2010-2011 through 2012-2013, hardware and teacher training were most likely to see the largest percentage of districts planning to increase spending. The implementation of Common Core assessments likely drove some of this investment in hardware and teacher training in the past; however, the desire to increase overall student access to technology also plays a role. Districts may not be saying that one-to-one is their goal, but they continue to move in that direction. Their budget plans also reflect a clear awareness that teacher training is an essential element of any expansion of technology use.
 
District characteristics (size, metropolitan status, and region) are sometimes associated with differences in plans for technology spending. While no significant differences are seen by metropolitan status of region, looking at projected increases by district size reveals a difference in budget plans for hardware purchases. Medium-size districts are significantly more likely than their smaller counterparts to be planning increases in hardware budgets.

Our Current Products
 
We currently offer the following products:
 
MimioStudio Interactive Instructional Software
 
MimioStudio Interactive Instructional Software enables the creation, editing, and presentation of interactive instructional lessons and activities. These lessons and activities can be presented and managed from the front of the classroom using any of Boxlight’s front of classroom display systems including MimioTeach + our non-interactive projectors, ProColor Interactive LED panels, MimioBoard Touch + our non-interactive projectors, MimioFrame + our non-interactive projectors or ProjectoWrite “P” Series interactive projectors in either pen or touch controlled versions. MimioStudio can also be operated using MimioPad as a full-featured remote control or a mobile device such as an iPad or tablet which includes a display screen that fully replicates the front-of-classroom display generated by MimioStudio. Operation with a mobile device is enabled via the three-user license for MimioMobile, see next, provided with the MimioStudio license that accompanies all front-of-classroom devices from Mimio.
 
MimioMobile Collaboration and Assessment Application
 
The introduction of MimioMobile, a software accessory for MimioStudio, in 2014 introduced a new era of fully interactive student activities that are able to be directly and immediately displayed on the front-of-classroom interactive displays through MimioStudio.
 
MimioMobile allows fully interactive activities to be pushed to student classroom devices. The students can manipulate objects within the activities, annotate “on top” of them, and even create completely new content on their own handheld devices. MimioMobile also enables assessment using the mobile devices. The teacher can create multiple choice, true\false, yes\no, and text entry assessment questions. The students can respond at their own speed and their answers are stored within MimioStudio from which the teacher can display graphs showing student results. This “continuous assessment” allows formative assessment that can help guide the teacher as to whether to re-teach the material if understanding is low or move forward in the lesson. We believe that this interactive and student dependent instructional model can dramatically enhance student outcomes.
 
Boxlight Front-of-Classroom Interactive Displays
 
Boxlight offers the broadest line of interactive displays, each of which provides large image size and interactive technology that complements the capabilities of MimioStudio and MimioMobile.

We offer SoundLite audio solutions as an affordable and easy-to-install amplified speaker system for use with all of our projectors. The 30 watt SoundLite product is available with a wireless RF microphone. This device produces quality stereo sound in any room.
 
Features in future SoundLite models will have a security-enabled system and IP addressable audio classroom solution allowing point-to-point address as well as a network wide area address. A panic switch on the wireless transmitters will enable live broadcast of classroom audio and simultaneously trigger predetermined alerts. This feature is designed to work over a school’s existing network infrastructure.
 
Non-Interactive projectors
 
We distribute a full line of standard, non-interactive projectors. The Cambridge Series features embedded wireless display functions and is available in short and standard throw options. Offering brightness from 2,700 to 4,000 lumens, we furnish projectors for small classrooms to large classrooms with the Cambridge platform. This series is available in both XGA and WXGA resolutions to replace projectors on existing interactive whiteboards in classrooms operating on limited budgets. The Boxlight Group has designed this platform to provide easy user maintenance with side-changing lamps and filters and developed HEPA filtration systems for harsh environments.
 
Over the past several years, we have together with strategic allies, provided customized products that fit specific needs of customers, such as the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Working with Nextel Systems, the Boxlight Group delivered approximately 4,000 projectors, with special kitting performance, asset tagging, custom start up screens, operating defaults appropriate for harsh environments, and other unique product specifications. the Boxlight Group also met requirements that each projector contain at least 51% U.S. content and be assembled in the United States. A service center was appointed in Israel to provide warranty service and support. The US Army in connection with the Israeli Defense Forces found the Boxlight Group to be the only manufacturer able to meet the stringent requirements, leading not only to the original multi-year contract, but to extensions for favorable execution and performance.

Integration Strategy
 
We have centralized our business management for all acquisitions through an enterprise resource planning system. We have streamlined the process to drive front-line sales forecasting to factory production. Through the enterprise resource planning system, we have synchronized five separate accounting and customer relationship management systems through a cloud-based interface to improve inter-company information sharing and allow management at the Company to have immediate access to snapshots of the performance of each of our subsidiaries. As we grow, organically or through acquisition, we plan to move to a multi-currency model of our enterprise resource planning system.

Competition
 
In the interactive education industry, we face substantial competition from developers, manufacturers and distributers of interactive learning products and solutions. The industry is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of interactive projectors and interactive whiteboards. We face increased competition from companies with strong positions in certain markets we serve, and in new markets and regions we may enter. These companies manufacture and/or distribute new, disruptive or substitute products that compete for the pool of available funds that previously could have been spent on interactive displays and associated products. Our ability to integrate our technologies and remain innovative and develop new technologies desired by our current and potential new contract manufacturing customers will determine our ability to grow our contract manufacturing divisions.
 
The Company competes with other developers, manufacturers and distributors of interactive projectors and personal computer technologies, tablets, television screens, smart phones. Interactive whiteboards, since first introduced, have evolved from a high-cost technology that involves multiple components, requiring professional installers, to a one-piece technology that is available at increasingly reduced price points and affords simple installations. With lowered technology entry barriers, we face heated competition from other interactive whiteboard developers, manufacturers and distributors. However, the market presents new opportunities in responding to demands to replace outdated and failing interactive whiteboards with more affordable and simpler solution interactive whiteboards. In addition, the Company has begun to see expansion in the market to sales of complementary products that work in conjunction with the interactive technology, including software, audio solutions, data capture, and tablets.
