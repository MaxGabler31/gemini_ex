Corporate History
 
Arista Financial Corp. (the “Company”), a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on December 15, 2009 as Hunt for Travel, Inc. to design and market travel excursions featuring entertainment, adventure, intellectual stimulation and access to experts on topics related to the destinations they visit. Subsequently, the Company ceased to operate in the travel industry sector and became a “shell company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, as amended, as it had no operations. On February 16, 2012, the Company changed its name to Praco Corporation and announced its intention to sell the Company to another operational entity.
 
On April 19, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Arista Capital Ltd. (“Arista”) and the shareholders of Arista (“Arista Shareholders”) pursuant to which the Company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, to exchange newly issued shares of the Company for shares of Arista held by the Arista Shareholders, with Arista becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Transaction”). The closing of the Transaction (the “Closing”) occurred as of December 14, 2017 and the Company ceased to be a “shell company” as defined in Rule 12b-2. See “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Share Exchange”.
 
Current Business
 
Substantially all of the Company’s current business operations are conducted through Arista. Arista was formed on June 10, 2014 as a Nevada corporation. Arista is a finance company that provides financing to other small finance companies that do not have significant access to the capital markets. Typically, Arista does this by acquiring lease portfolios from such lenders at a purchase price that yields Arista an annual return and these lenders continue to service the portfolios purchased by us. We are currently focused on leases for trucks and construction equipment.
 
Arista was founded by a team of experienced finance professionals who saw significant opportunity to participate in this market after the financial crisis of 2009, as traditional funding sources for this segment of the financial market have disappeared or have severely limited their financing activities in this area. Arista intends to participate in this market through a variety of funding arrangements including debt financings, equity infusions and direct loan participations. Management believes that although small asset-based lenders (“Lenders”) have limited access to capital necessary to enable growth, these lenders have well-managed and maintained origination, underwriting and administrative infrastructure as well as expertise and experience in their specific area of lending. Arista has accessed this experience and infrastructure by participating with these lenders in their lending opportunities.
 
Currently, Arista relies on one Lender to acquire financing leases and to service such leases, however, Arista believes that other Lenders are available if Arista is unable to acquire leases from its current Lender. Lenders primarily finance tractor trailers or other transportation equipment and construction equipment to companies that ordinarily would not be able to obtain dealer or commercial bank financing. These Lenders offer both finance leases and operating leases, with terms up to 60 months and transaction sizes from $10,000 to $150,000 and target advance rates that are not more than 80% loan-to-value. Generally the leases have effective interest rates of around 30%. These Lenders have developed their own credit approval processes based upon their experience with entering into leases with small transportation and construction companies. The Lenders generally require significant down payments to be made in cash by the borrower. Accordingly, since the collateral usually has significant value relative to the value of the loans made by them, Arista believes that the risk of loss of principal is not significant. Arista’s current arrangements provide that it will purchase portfolios of leases from a Lender and such Lender will service the portfolios. Arista believes that its lending activities can achieve attractive net returns of capital. Arista has raised approximately $960,000 as of December 31, 2018, and has purchased approximately $368,000 of leases in the aggregate since inception. At December 31, 2018, Arista’s leasing portfolio consisted of seven leases valued at $96,505.
 
Arista reviews each lease portfolio in depth to determine which loans to purchase. Arista also performs a collateral valuation to determine if the purchase price of the loan will be covered if the collateral is repossessed. To this end, Arista utilizes a third-party service provider with experience in the transportation and construction equipment industries to assist in the valuation of the underlying collateral. All leases purchased to date have gone through this collateral valuation process.

Our strategy is to identify specialty Lenders who have operated successfully for a significant period of time and are in need of capital to grow their loan portfolio. We believe our management team has the experience necessary to identify these Lenders and our investment approach involves, among other things:
 

● | an assessment of the markets and overall macroeconomic environment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | substantial Lender-specific research and analysis; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | with respect to each individual Lender, an emphasis on capital preservation, low volatility and management of downside risk.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   
We seek to identify those Lenders exhibiting superior fundamental risk-reward profiles and a strong business history, while focusing on the absolute and relative value of each individual lending investment. Arista intends to diversify its list of Lenders and make purchases of their portfolios of leases on a regular basis when such risk-reward profile is attractive.
 
Employees
 
We employ 3 people and utilize independent contractors as needed. 
 
Competition
 
We compete for investments with a number of other lenders and investment funds (including private equity funds and venture capital funds), special purpose acquisition company sponsors, investment banks with underwriting activities, hedge funds that invest in private investments in public equities, traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks, and other sources of financing. Many of these entities have significantly greater financial and managerial resources than we do.
Regulatory Matters
 
Although most states do not directly regulate the commercial equipment lease financing business, certain states require lenders and finance companies to be licensed, impose limitations on certain contract terms and on interest rates and other charges, mandate disclosure of certain contract terms and constrain collection practices and remedies. Arista does not operate in any states that would require Arista to be licensed. Pursuant to agreements under which we purchase leases and other loan obligations, we are typically indemnified against losses resulting from the failure of the originator to have complied with applicable laws relating to obligations prior to our purchase of such obligations.
