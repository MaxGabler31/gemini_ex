We were incorporated in Nevada and our headquarters are located at 8925 West Post Road, Suite 102, Las Vegas NV, 89148.  We are a smart solutions technology provider focused on providing smart solutions advisory services, developing and acquiring early stage wireless 5G/6G and beyond technologies that meet certain core application requirements that deliver potential enterprise smart city solutions. Types of Products include IPTV technologies, digital displays technologies, VR, AI, data analytics software and wireless security tools for Stadiums, Airports, Universities and Smart City Projects. Our Mission: create shareholder value by creating a family of wireless technology companies specializing in vertical markets that support subsidiary business units with necessary skill sets to deliver value added smart Solutions to partners and customers.
 
A wireless Internet of Things (IoT) technology company and its subsidiaries and divisions, GZ6G Technologies Corp (GZ6G) is focused on acquiring, developing and overseeing innovative wireless IoT technology companies for the emerging 5G and Wi-Fi6 marketplaces, including target markets such as stadiums, airports, universities, racetracks, casinos, and smart city projects.
 
Our controlled subsidiary, Green Zebra Media Corp (GZMC) is one such innovative provider of wireless hardware gateways, communications, marketing and sponsorship, data analytics platforms and Customer Relationship Management “CRM” technology. Our products are used for stadiums, cities, airports, universities and hospitality markets.
 
The focus of our operations in fiscal 2021, were contracts which can most efficiently, and cost effectively, bring revenue generating operations through partnerships with venues and industries that must adapt to the new 5G and WiFi6 environment. Beyond that, GZ6G and controlled entities are establishing a global command center to offer our customer base scale and agility, speed the launch of wireless, digital services and data analytics services, and seamlessly connect customers to world class experiences.   It is our intent that wireless IT network managed services and data center initiative for clients and partners will monitor cutting edge Wireless IT networks with the ability to dispatch technicians as necessary to ensure continuous functionality of our Wi-Fi networks.
 
The use of Wi-Fi networks in high-density areas is the most efficient manner to ensure consistent wireless connectivity. Two trends are converging today to propel upgrades and new deployments of Wi-Fi networks, including 5G and WiFi6. First, consumer demand for wireless connectivity continues to grow, overwhelming many wireless and Wi-Fi networks. Secondly, many large entities are seeking new digital media avenues to obtain exposure to target markets through online ‘impressions’, particularly when they have access to a captive audience. GZ6G is uniquely positioned to facilitate the convergence of these two trends.  Additionally, GZ6G is developing future Wi-Fi networks that can integrate the Internet of Things (IoT) and significantly enhance network utility and user experiences.

The greater use of wireless devices (smartphones, tablets) and the emergence of IoT places has increased demand even further on wireless networks. Large network companies promote the 5G network deployment, but there are limitations to its effectiveness, particularly in high-density areas. Wi-Fi networks remain the best network deployment plan for airports, businesses, universities, transport hubs and city locations where there are high-density network demands.
 
Existing Wi-Fi technology can significantly improve wireless performance at airports, transport hubs, convention centers, resorts, and stadiums. The future of Wi-Fi is even more exciting. New developments by GZ6G will significantly enhance network throughput and allow for apps to reside on a venue’s network rather than the cloud. The result is much faster response and the ability to customize apps to serve local businesses, communities and users of the network.
 
The GZ6G total solution turns the Wi-Fi cost center into a revenue center by (a) deploying a state-of-the-art Wi-Fi broadcast network with customized software for enhanced user experience and (b) obtaining sponsors who desire exposure to consumers and businesses in high-density areas. This combination can easily justify Wi-Fi network deployment today.
 
Additionally, GZ6G plans to vertically integrate its operational model, providing both software and hardware as well as full support services to its customer base.
 
GZ6G is installing Wi-Fi networks in high-density use areas and is partnering with other technology companies and host entities (stadiums, universities, airports, resorts) for the GZ6G total solution. GZ6G has established strategic relationships with (a) network companies that are pitching the GZ6G solution; (b) established Wi-Fi networks that need upgrading; and (c) a range of potential sponsors in a variety of industries.
 
The Company has generated limited revenue and we have not yet finished executing contracts; however, we are in negotiations with two different large venues and one small Enterprise client that we hope to finalize in the first quarter of 2022; revenues will not be generated from these projects until the installation of our products are complete; mid 2022.
 
The Company currently has four divisions that will implement actions to correspond with the above services.

Industry Overview
 
Wi-Fi technology enables wireless users to use internet and telecom services in a high-density environment. Without Wi-Fi in areas where there is a high concentration of wireless users, response time degrades, phone calls get ‘dropped,’ internet connectivity may be intermittent and user experience suffers. For this reason, Wi-Fi deployment is critical for internet and telecom networks in many geographical footprints.
 
The market for Wi-Fi equipment worldwide is expected to grow to $15.6 billion by 2022, according to industry research by MarketsandMarkets, Inc. This describes a compound annual growth of 21.2% through 2022. Such growth is driven by the use of wireless devices including smart phones, tablets and development of the IoT market. Approximately 67% of the worldwide wireless equipment market is in the US.  MarketWatch reports the Global Wireless Connectivity market, including chips and devices will reach $31.8 billion by 2022.
 
The primary drivers for the deployment of Wi-Fi networks are increasing bandwidth demand from businesses, universities, smart city projects, and consumers. With the integration of more images and videos for internet users, demand for greater network bandwidth increases. The weakest link in broadband networks is the wireless connection to the end user. The latest Wi-Fi network technologies address this weak link in a cost-effective manner.
 
The primary constraints to deploying Wi-Fi networks has been poor-user experiences in high-density areas, security and privacy concerns. Users with multiple applications on smart phones, or with multiple devices (smart phone and tablet or laptop) place high demands on wireless networks. Bandwidth intensive applications that include video and GPS create greater demands on wireless networks.

How does the host/network manager (airport, smart city, business, university) of Wi-Fi decide to improve network capabilities? Wi-Fi networks provide critical connectivity services to users, and bandwidth demand from users creates the need to upgrade the networks. Security on Wi-Fi networks is improving, but bandwidth is lacking. Wi-Fi network users are demanding more bandwidth while traveling, when at sporting events, when spending time ‘downtown’ or in commercial districts, and when at resorts, or on university campuses.
 
GZ6G Technologies Target Markets
 
GZ6G is focusing on high-density use venues where (1) internet connectivity demand is high and likely to grow, (2) the host venue recognizes the benefit of providing Wi-Fi broadcasting service, and (3) venues where sponsors are interested in consumer exposure. The target venues include universities, professional sports stadiums and racetracks, airports, resorts and smart-city projects.
Hardware and Software Solutions Today
 
GZ6G Technologies installs state-of-the-art Wi-Fi equipment designed to meet the projected high-density use demands for the location. Equipment manufacturers may include Cisco, Cradle Point, D-Link, Juniper, Linksys. Software may include products that are customizable from Brick & Mobile, Cloud4Wi, Purple Wifi, Panasonic, Socifi, Tanaza.
 
Wi-Fi network installation is customized to ensure the correct internet connectivity and speed is available throughout the venue. GZ6G has developed the software tools that are customized for the host/network manager to easily manage the network through the use of dashboards, which may include integrating additional components such as a security system. The software tools (broadcasting system) allow for the host to create pop up notices to remind users of important items regarding safety, first aid, ancillary services and special offers. The network manager gathers data to understand characteristics of user demands on the network. The host/network venue manager may also design features which provide information to users to enhance their time while in the area, such as discounts to affiliated stores or restaurants, notices of services at the facility such as food outlets, retail items, special benefits to repeat customers, or notice of where emergency healthcare is available. The host venue can customize the user interface on the network and as new supplementary services become available, such as a new food venue or new emergency management procedures, the customer interface can be changed.
 
Company Offerings
 
GZ6G Technologies focus on leading wireless marketing & CRM technology smart solutions provider, offering closed loop security gateways, wireless marketing and sponsorship CRM platform solutions, and deep data analytic solutions for the hospitality, stadiums, airports, universities, and cities. This customized approach to marketing will allow clients to elevate the interaction between the venue and the consumers on their platform. The second division will work with sponsors for unique marketing opportunities within the venue and for the venue.
 
The future vision for the Company is the inclusion of four main divisions.

We are in the process of developing a global command center that will allow us to monitor all of our venues in one central place.  We will have technical engineers available in case any of the networks go down in any of the venues at any time.  We will be able to remotely navigate any issues arising at the venues so that service will be virtually uninterrupted.
 
10

 

Practice areas can either function independently to address a client’s specific functional IoT needs, or be combined to provide brands with a holistic service offering that will handle all of their needs.
 
From banner and social media advertisements and advertorials to website and shopping portal purchase engagements, and product procurement, we will support venues in all of their touch points and engagement opportunities with their end audience.
 
We will offer the following core services:
 
We define venue as our target client, it can be a point of interest within a city, or it could be the city itself. Venues are a specific geographical location, such as a city, airport, university, stadium, racetrack, casino, or hospitality location (trade center, hotel etc.). When a venue connects to the network it is called a closed loop communication solution.
 
Qualify – Our infrastructure team goes into a new venue to ensure that they have the right infrastructure or bandwidth in place. This also means the team will be looking at whether the venue has the appropriate Wi-Fi capabilities in place, so the equipment will sync. Qualify also means that an evaluation has been completed to ensure that the venue has the correct Wi-Fi speed so marketing materials such as videos, graphics and content will present itself correctly.
 
The new GZ6G Wi-Fi broadcast network facilitates the Internet of Things to function in a way that it was projected to do years ago. Several possibilities with Wi-Fi apps are as follows:
 

● | Instantly receive best location for emergency first aid with a selected route, walking or driving. Information on where closest drinking fountain, first aid station, among other things, is located. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Police can receive optimal path to particular location and control any security cameras in different locations. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumers receive information on where street parking is available in real time and which parking structures have spaces available. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Travelers can be notified of flight changes, allowing more restaurant time. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Real time information on shortest food lines at a stadium. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | 3-D images of museum, real-time information on lines at any venue. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cameras showing crowd at outdoor restaurant or parks. Control of access can change. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Security system cameras only available to certain parties such as police or other security personnel. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Short term restaurant or store specials when customer traffic is low. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
All of this and more is possible with apps that do not require downloads from the cloud. It’s all available instantly because it is on the venue network. Each venue network can control which apps are available to which group of users, such that security cameras can be available to a select group. The possible apps are endless, and each venue network can customize its network page as it sees fit.
 
Our team will possess core capabilities and skill sets that help our clients execute on targeted growth plans that tap into the trillion-dollar tech market. We will serve clients across a wide range of industries and geographies.
 
Our growth will be through a multi-prong plan: (1) growing an in-house sales team; (2) leveraging strategic partners who are advisors to decision makers and owners of companies and will be conduits for introductions; and (3) client referrals.
 
We will build a core team of product developers, creative designers, sales professionals and account managers under each practice area to service existing and new clients.  Our philosophy is to develop “repeatable” software platforms around common business needs that can be productized to allow for us to scale development of new projects and grow revenues without relying on building large development teams.
 
Our expertise is IoT; we will help companies become relevant, agile and competitive in a global consumer commerce environment.  We will offer the ability for worldwide marketing and advertising through our developed software and available Wi-Fi at our venues.  Consumers want to be able to shop, among other things, anytime and anywhere, and on any device; our expertise allows for us to put our brands right in front of this consumer activity.
 
The global information technology industry is experiencing global growth and US companies have to be prepared to be competitive on a global marketplace.

Key Relationships
 
GZ6G has several strong relationships that are mutually beneficial to both partners; partners that will leverage the GZ6G capabilities to maintain and/or grow revenue streams for both entities.
Current Partnerships
 
Lumen Technologies/CenturyLink
 
Lumen Technologies: Lumen Technologies, previously CenturyLink, is one of the largest telecommunications organizations in the country focused on using their networks at cities, stadiums and universities. As a trusted third-party solutions partner, GZ6G Technologies offers the smart solution tools and expertise required for Lumen Technology to develop long term user engagement solutions.
 
Brand LTD – Brand LTD is our advertising and marketing partner/creative agency.
 
ViTech – ViTech is one of our IPTV Solutions providers for large venues and smart cities.
 
Aruba Wireless – Aruba is one of the partners for which we utilize their hardware for smart venues and smart cities.
 
Internetsoft – Internetsoft is our software development strategic partner that works with our internal development team to scale our software development projects for smart venues and smart cities.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
We plan to market directly to sports arenas, concert venues, universities, racetracks, casinos, and to smart cities using our existing relationships as well as deploying a number of popular online marketing tactics.  Additionally, we will be leveraging strategic partners who are advisors to decision makers, and owners of companies, and who will be conduits for introductions and client referrals.
 
GZ6G has relationships with national and regional Fortune 500 entities that are seeking targeted methods to reach existing and potential customers. These sponsors include commercial enterprises that desire to advertise or collect analytic data on users in high-density locations. National sponsors include the major network carriers, auto manufacturers, airlines, casinos, grocery stores, online retail, consumer discretionary goods and restaurant chains. Many of these seek exposure to consumers in specific areas.
 
With selective Wi-Fi markets, a sponsor can more effectively deploy advertising budgets. Local restaurants can advertise specials at football games. Casinos or restaurants can advertise to airport customers or smart-city users. Host entities can identify food specials at certain times when lines are low. Airports could provide flight updates in real time with notices to fliers that log in on their flight.
 
As the GZ6G network installation base grows, the Company will have the ability to offer sponsors a variety of venues for exposure.
