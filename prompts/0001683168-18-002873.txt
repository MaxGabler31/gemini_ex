ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We have been developing and manufacturing advanced optical instruments since 1982. Today, the majority of our business is the design and manufacture of high-quality medical devices and approximately 17% of our revenue in fiscal year 2018 is from the design and manufacture of military and industrial products. Our medical instrumentation line includes traditional endoscopes and endocouplers as well as other custom imaging and illumination products for use in minimally invasive surgical procedures. Much of our recent development efforts have been targeted at the development of next generation endoscopes. Over the last ten years, we have funded internal research and development programs to develop next generation capabilities for designing and manufacturing 3D endoscopes and very small Microprecision™ lenses, anticipating future requirements as the surgical community continues to demand smaller and more enhanced imaging systems for minimally invasive surgery. Our unique proprietary technology in these areas, combined with recent developments in the areas of 3D displays and millimeter sized CMOS image sensors, has allowed us to begin commercialization of these technologies. Thus, over 30% of our revenues in each of the fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018 were derived from engineering and design services we performed for our customers to incorporate our technologies and capabilities into their medical device products. We believe that new products based on these technologies provide enhanced imaging for existing surgical procedures which help to enable development of many new medical device products and related medical procedures. Over 50% of our total revenues in fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018 were derived from the assembly and manufacture of endoscopic medical devises, sub-assemblies and optical components ordered by our customers and usually developed from the engineering and design services we perform for them. We expect sales revenue increases to come from the orders from our customers to manufacture the products we help them engineer and design.
History
 
We incorporated in Massachusetts in December 1982 and have been publicly-owned since November 1990. References to our Company contained herein include our two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Precise Medical, Inc. and Wood’s Precision Optics Corporation, Limited, except where the context otherwise requires. Our website is www.poci.com. Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this report.
Principal Products and Services
 
Our Current Core Business: Since 1982, we have manufactured medical products such as endoscopes and endocouplers. We have developed and sold endoscopes incorporating various optical technologies including our proprietary Lenslock™ technology, for use in a variety of minimally invasive surgical and diagnostic procedures. Today, we produce endoscopes for various applications, which are CE marked and therefore certified for sale throughout the European Economic Area. Since 1985, we have developed, manufactured and sold a proprietary product line of endocouplers. We also design and manufacture custom optical medical devices to satisfy our customers’ specific requirements. In addition to medical devices, we also manufacture and sell components and assemblies specially designed for industrial and military use.

Microprecision™ Lenses and Micro Medical Cameras: While the size of endoscopes has gradually decreased over time, the widespread use of very small endoscopes, with diameters of one millimeter or smaller, has been limited, in part, we believe, by the inability of traditional lens fabrication methods to support these smaller sizes with good image quality and acceptable manufacturing costs. We believe our Microprecision™ optics technology provides a solution to this problem. Combined with recent advances by other companies in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor, or CMOS, image sensor fabrication techniques, our Microprecision™ lenses and proprietary manufacturing techniques enable the manufacture of micro medical cameras at low prices and with sizes on the order of one millimeter or less, characteristics that make them well suited to medical applications.
 
In June 2015, we announced a partnership with OmniVision Technologies, Inc., and Fujikura, Ltd., in which we jointly developed a CMOS based camera module with a diameter of 1.6 mm and 400 x 400 pixel resolution, representing superior image quality for camera modules of its size. In June 2017 OmniVision Technologies, Inc. announced our collaboration with them in the development of an even smaller, high-quality optical solution based on a newly developed OmniVision image sensor integrated with our Microprecsion™ lenses. This solution enables even smaller diameter endoscopes for use in medical procedures.
 
We are currently engaged in development projects with numerous customers to design and produce even smaller CMOS based camera modules together with customized illumination using various technologies to match the needs of the medical device endoscopes. We are also currently designing disposable versions of our camera modules and assemblies designed for single-use and reduced risk of contamination from repeated use. We believe these on-going improvements are significant to the continued evolution and acceptance of our Microprecision™ technology platform. 
 
We have been engaged by various customers for an increasing amount of development work relating to the design of endoscopes and camera assemblies that utilize our Microprecision™ technology. We have now received two production orders exceeding $1 each from two customers for their custom designed products, and we believe in the future we will receive follow-on orders from these customers as well as production orders from other customers currently in our engineering and design pipeline.
 
3D Endoscopes: Our 3D endoscopes provide next generation optical imaging for minimally invasive surgical procedures that utilize hand-held rigid endoscopes by using the brain’s natural ability to perceive depth, which is the third dimension, by viewing one’s environment through two eyes. Utilizing our proprietary technology to provide independent images to right and left eyes, surgeons can view the operative field with 3D perception.
Competition and Markets
 
We sell our products in a highly competitive market and we compete for business with both foreign and domestic manufacturers. Many of our current competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater resources than we do. In addition, there is an ongoing risk that other domestic or foreign companies who do not currently service or manufacture products for our target markets, some with greater experience in the optics industry and greater financial resources than we have, may seek to produce products or services that compete directly with ours.
 
While our resources are substantially more limited than those of some of our competitors, we believe that we can compete successfully in this market on the basis of product quality, price, delivery and innovation. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain a technological advantage over our competitors. To this end, we intend to continue to aggressively support and augment our internal engineering, research and development resources and to aggressively pursue patent protection for existing and new technology. We believe that our unique technical capabilities in the areas of Microprecision™ optics, micro medical cameras and illumination, as well as 3D endoscopes currently represent competitive advantages for us in the minimally invasive surgical device market.

Market Opportunities
 
Microprecision™ Lenses and Micro Medical Cameras: While other approaches exist for the manufacture of camera lenses, we design custom camera module assemblies with the combined objectives of low cost, small size, range of optical specifications and high image quality desired by our customer’s device specifications. By enabling the production of millimeter sized and smaller cameras with low manufacturing costs, we believe our Microprecision™ technology opens the possibility to replace existing re-sterilizable endoscopes with a single-use alternative. Also, the small size of our Microprecision™ lenses and micro medical cameras combined with our proprietary illumination techniques can provide visualization for existing procedures that are currently performed blind or with sub-optimal imaging, and we believe can facilitate the development of new surgical procedures that are currently impractical without sub-millimeter visualization instrumentation.
3D Endoscopes and Robotic Surgery Systems: 3D endoscopes have been used for many years as part of robotic surgery systems partly because the market price of robotic surgery systems is high enough to support the cost of a high quality custom 3D display. Competition amongst medical device companies, many of which are our customers for other products, in the area of 3D robotic surgery systems is increasing, and various companies are now pursuing less expensive, procedure specific robotic systems. We believe our experience and expertise in 3D endoscopes for medical applications could be a benefit to various companies in this area that could provide us with new product development and manufacturing opportunities.
Sales and Marketing
 
We market our engineering design and manufacturing services relating to 3D endoscopes, Microprecision™ optical components and micro medical cameras by leveraging our existing relationships with major medical device companies – many of whom are current customers. We intend to make our existing and future technologies available to our customers for use in their current and newly developed minimally invasive surgical products and to eventually develop and market our own proprietary products, which incorporate these new technologies. In addition to direct sales channels through our existing customer relationships and referrals, we also develop new sales opportunities through our website, email mailings and attendance at market specific tradeshows.
International Business
 
We have had negligible direct export sales to date. However, our medical products have received the CE mark certification, which permits sales into the European Economic Area and which benefits our customers as they market their products manufactured by us or containing our sub-assemblies into markets outside the United States. In the future, we may establish or use additional production facilities overseas to produce key components for our business, such as lenses. From the 1990s through approximately 2014, we maintained a physical presence in Asia to support business and quality control activities throughout the region as needed. We continue to acquire various optical components from overseas to meet the needs of custom device designs. We believe that the availability of specialized components and cost savings from various overseas production resources is essential to our ability to deliver complex and unique device designs and to compete on a price basis in the medical products area particularly and to our profitability generally.
Research and Development
 
We believe that our future success depends, to a large degree, on our ability to continue to conceive and develop new optical products and technologies to enhance the performance characteristics and methods of manufacture of existing and new products. Although development work on behalf of customers is almost entirely performed under revenue generating contracts and customer purchase orders, research and development expenses are incurred on our own proprietary products and technology, such as Microprecision™ optics, micro medical cameras and 3D endoscopes. Accordingly, we treat engineering expenses not consumed in customer contracted development and our investment of funds and resources in internal product and intellectual property development as research and development expense in the accompanying statement of operations. For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, research and development expenses were $456,377 and $464,162, respectively.

Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers
 
A key raw material component for our products is precision grade optical glass, which we obtain from a few suppliers, principally SCHOTT North America, Inc. and Ohara Corporation.
 
We obtain CMOS sensors used in our development of endoscope products for our customers from various suppliers including OmniVision Technologies, Inc., and AWAIBA Lda. We believe that while the number of sources of supply is limited for the CMOS sensors with the specifications used in medical device endoscopes we develop, the manufacturing capacities of those suppliers is adequate to meet our demand in the next twelve months. Likewise, a limited number of suppliers provide CMOS electronic cabling services for the smallest sensors, such as FujiKura, Ltd. and NET USA, Inc., and High Speed Interconnects. However, we believe our demand for these services is relatively small compared to these companies’ and others’ capacities for CMOS sensor electronic cabling services.
 
Patents and Trademarks 
 
We rely, in part, upon patents, trade secrets and proprietary knowledge as well as personnel policies and employee confidentiality agreements concerning inventions and other creative efforts to develop and maintain our competitive position. We plan to file for patents, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and in other appropriate countries to protect our intellectual property rights to the greatest extent practicable. We currently hold rights to various United States patents, and have patent applications pending, including applications for our new generation of micro medical cameras and 3D endoscopes. Our current patent portfolio includes patents, rights to patents and patent applications that cover various aspects of our technology in the following areas:

— | Medical devices; 
--+--------------------------------------------------
— | 3-D endoscopes; 
— | Microprecision™ lenses and micro medical cameras;
— | Military products. 

 
The patents contained in our current patent portfolio have various expiration dates through May 2036. We are not aware of any infringements of these patents. While we believe that our pending applications relate to patentable devices or concepts, these patents may not ultimately be issued and we may not be able to successfully defend these patents or effectively limit the development of competitive products and services.
 
In July 2011, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc., in which we received $2.5 million in connection with the sale of certain intellectual property. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to assign to Intuitive Surgical all of the issued and non-expired patents and pending patent applications that we held on the date of the agreement, and in return, Intuitive Surgical agreed to grant to us a royalty-free, worldwide license to these patents in fields outside of medical robotics.
 
We intend to continue to innovate and extend our technological capabilities in the areas of 3-D endoscopy Microprecision™ optics, micro medical cameras, and related illumination techniques, and to aggressively pursue patent protection for such developments.
 
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2018, we had 30 employees, 26 of which were full-time employees. There were 20 employees in manufacturing, 6 in engineering/research and development and 4 in finance and administration. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relations with our employees are very good.

No other accounts accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at June 30, 2018 or 2017.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relative to the protection of the environment. From time to time, we use a small amount of hazardous materials in our operations. We believe that we currently comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and intend to do our best efforts to remain in compliance.
Government Regulations
 
Domestic Regulation. We currently develop, manufacture and sell several medical products, the marketing of which is subject to governmental regulation in the United States. Medical devices are regulated in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and, in some cases, by certain state agencies. The FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, promotion and distribution of medical devices in the United States. Generally, medical devices require clearance or approval prior to commercial distribution. Additionally, certain material changes to, and changes in, intended uses of, medical devices are also subject to FDA review and clearance or approval. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in failure of the FDA to grant pre-market clearance or approval, withdrawal or suspension of approval, suspension of production, or the imposition of various other penalties.
 
We previously notified the FDA of our intent to market our endoscopes, image couplers, beamsplitters, adapters and video ophthalmoscopes, and the FDA has determined that we may market such devices, subject to the general control provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. We obtained this FDA permission without the need to undergo a lengthy and expensive approval process due to the FDA’s determination that such devices met the regulatory standard of being substantially equivalent to existing FDA-approved devices.
 
In the future, we plan to market additional medical devices that may require the FDA’s permission to market such products. We may also develop additional products or seek to sell some of our current or future medical products in a manner that requires us to obtain the permission of the FDA to market such products, as well as the regulatory approval or license of other federal, state and local agencies or similar agencies in other countries. The FDA has authority to conduct detailed inspections of manufacturing plants in order to assure that “good manufacturing practices” are being followed in the manufacture of medical devices, to require periodic reporting of product defects to the FDA and to prohibit the sale of devices, which do not comply with law.

Foreign Requirements. Sales of medical device products outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that may vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements would jeopardize our ability to market and sell our products in foreign jurisdictions. The regulatory environment in the European Union member countries of the European Economic Area for medical device products differs from that in the United States. Medical devices sold in the European Economic Area must bear the Conformité Européenne, or CE mark. Devices are classified by manufacturers according to the risks they represent, with a classification of Class III representing the highest risk devices and Class I representing the lowest risk devices. Once a device has been classified, the manufacturer can follow one of a series of conformity assessment routes, typically through a registered quality system, and demonstrate compliance to a “European Notified Body.” The CE mark may then be applied to the device. Maintenance of the system is ensured through annual on-site audits by the notified body and a post-market surveillance system requiring the manufacturer to submit serious complaints to the appropriate governmental authority. All of our medical products are manufactured in conformity with the CE mark requirements.
