Item 1. | Description of Business. 
------------+-----------------------------

Our Company
 
Empire Post Media, Inc. a Nevada corporation (“Empire”, the “Company, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a publicly quoted shell company seeking to create value for its shareholders by merging with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock.
 
No potential merger candidate has been identified at this time.
 
We do not propose to restrict our search for a business opportunity to any particular industry or geographical area and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business in any industry. We have unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.
 
The selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and risky. Additionally, we have only limited resources and may find it difficult to locate good opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to us and our shareholders. We will select any potential business opportunity based on our management’s best business judgment.
 
Our activities are subject to several significant risks, which arise primarily as a result of the fact that we have no specific business, and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management, which potentially could act without the consent, vote, or approval of our shareholders. The risks faced by us are further increased as a result of its lack of resources and our inability to provide a prospective business opportunity with significant capital.
 
Our History
 
Empire was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 13, 2009. The Company was a development stage company engaged in the business of providing post production services to the movie and television industry and the production of reality shows. The post production services included both two-dimensional and three-dimensional formats and were offered on a collateralized-deferred basis to producers and owners of feature films; television movies, specials and series; short subjects and documentaries. The Company also produced a Reality TV pilot.

Revenue
 
We had no revenue for the year ended November 30, 2018 and no revenues for the year ended November 30, 2017.
 
General Business Plan
 
Our business plan to seek a merger has many uncertainties which pose risks to investors.
 
We intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons or firms which desire to seek the advantages of an issuer who has complied with the Securities Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”). We will not restrict our search to any specific business, industry or geographical location, and we may participate in business ventures of virtually any nature. This discussion of our proposed business is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities. We anticipate that we may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because of our lack of financial resources. We may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations, or that desire to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. All of these activities have risk to investors including dilution and management.
 
We expect that the selection of a business opportunity will be complex. Due to general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, we believe that there are numerous firms seeking the benefits of an issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act. Such benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, providing liquidity (subject to restrictions of applicable statutes) for all stockholders and other factors. Potentially, available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We have, and will continue to have, essentially no assets to provide the owners of business opportunities. However, we will be able to offer owners of acquisition candidates the opportunity to acquire a controlling ownership interest in an issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act without incurring the cost and time required to conduct an initial public offering.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, our Board of Directors. We intend to concentrate on identifying preliminary prospective business opportunities which may be brought to our attention through present associations of our director, professional advisors or by our stockholders. In analyzing prospective business opportunities, we will consider such matters as (i) available technical, financial and managerial resources; (ii) working capital and other financial requirements; (iii) history of operations, if any, and prospects for the future; (iv) nature of present and expected competition; (v) quality, experience and depth of management services; (vi) potential for further research, development or exploration; (vii) specific risk factors not now foreseeable but that may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the company; (viii) potential for growth or expansion; (ix) potential for profit; (x) public recognition and acceptance of products, services or trades; (xi) name identification; and (xii) other factors that we consider relevant. As part of our investigation of the business opportunity, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel. To the extent possible, we intend to utilize written reports and personal investigation to evaluate the above factors.
 
We will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction.
 
Acquisition Interest
 
In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another company or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon consummation of a transaction, it is probable that our present management and stockholders will no longer be in control of us. In addition, our sole director may, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by new directors without a vote of our stockholders, or sell his stock in us. Any such sale will only be made in compliance with the securities laws of the United States and any applicable state.
 
It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under application federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, as a negotiated element of the transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after it has successfully consummated a merger or acquisition and is no longer considered an inactive company.
 
The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on the value of our securities in the future. There is no assurance that such a trading market will develop.
 
While the actual terms of a transaction cannot be predicted, it is expected that the parties to any business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the business transaction in a so-called “tax-free” reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). In order to obtain tax-free treatment under the Code, it may be necessary for the owner of the acquired business to own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such event, our stockholders would retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This would result in significant dilution in the equity of our stockholders.

As part of our investigation, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of both parties, and the management of the opportunity.
 
With respect to any merger or acquisition, and depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities, our stockholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in us following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with assets and expectations of growth. Any merger or acquisition can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our stockholders.
 
We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written business agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally we anticipate that such agreements will (i) require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties; (ii) specify certain events of default; (iii) detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing; (iv) outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with the Company’s attorneys and accountants; (v) set forth remedies on defaults; and (vi) include miscellaneous other terms.
 
As stated above, we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to insure our compliance within the requirements of the 1934 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by that business to be acquired, the definitive closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the definitive closing documents will also contain a provision providing for reimbursement for our costs associated with the proposed transaction.
 
Competition
 
We believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
Investment Company Act 1940
 
Although we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the 1934 Act, we believe we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event we engage in business combinations that result in us holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company and incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the 1940 Act and, consequently, any violation of the 1940 Act would subject us to material adverse consequences. We believe that, currently, we are exempt under Regulation 3a-2 of the 1940 Act.
Intellectual Property
 
We own no intellectual property.
 
Employees
 
We presently have no full time executive, operational or clerical staff.
 
Mr. Dunn has been a director and officer of the Company since 2009 and the sole director and sole part-time-officer of the Company since January 1, 2013.
 
Factors Effecting Future Performance
 
Rather than an operating business, our goal is to obtain debt and/or equity financing to meet our ongoing operating expenses and attempt to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders.

Although there is no assurance that this series of events will be successfully completed, we believe we can successfully complete an acquisition or merger which will enable us to continue as a going concern. Any acquisition or merger will most likely be dilutive to our existing stockholders.
 
The factors affecting our future performance are listed and explained below under the section “Risk Factors” below:
 
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
The disclosure contained below, discusses generally the terms of the “Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act”. Currently the Company is without operations or revenues and as such does not anticipate that it will effect certain of the transactions covered by such Act until, if at all, the time a change in control of the Company is affected. Until at such time the Company effects a change in control it does not anticipate that it will benefit from the exemptions from certain financial disclosure required in a registration statement as well as the simplification of the sale of securities and the relaxation of general solicitation for Rule 506 offerings.
 
In April, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:
 
Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies;
 
Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;
 
Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;
 
Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and
 
Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and such sales are exempt from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements.
 
In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common equity securities was affected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of
 
(i) the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,
 
(ii) the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company’s IPO;
 
(iii) the company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or
 
(iv) the company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
The Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company and will be affected by some of the changes provided in the JOBS Act and certain of the new exemptions. The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.
 
Financial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:
 
(i) audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years;
 (ii) selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited;
 (iii) executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies. (A smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter)
 
However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.
 
The JOBS Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.

The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company’s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.
 
Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
 
Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act goes on to exempt emerging growth companies from the requirements in 1934 Act Section 14A(e) for companies with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.
 
Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO.
 
Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a road show.
 
Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.
 
The JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non- emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period.
