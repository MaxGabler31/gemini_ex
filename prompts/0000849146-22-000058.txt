We were incorporated in Colorado in June 1988 under the name Andraplex Corporation. We changed our corporate name to Yaak River Resources, Inc. in January 1992, and subsequently changed it again in October 2004 to Lifeline Therapeutics, Inc. In October 2004 and March 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Lifeline Nutraceuticals Corporation. In November 2006, we changed our name to LifeVantage Corporation. From our fiscal year 2005 until our fiscal year 2009, we marketed and sold a single product, Protandim®, through traditional retail stores. In October 2008, we announced that we were transitioning our business model from a traditional retail model to a direct sales model in which Protandim® would be sold primarily through a network of independent distributors. Since entering direct sales, we have increased our geographic reach by entering new international markets and increased our product offering by introducing additional scientifically-validated products.
In March 2018, following approval by our stockholders at our fiscal year 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Colorado to the State of Delaware pursuant to a plan of conversion. All outstanding shares of common stock, options and share units of the Colorado corporation were converted into an equivalent share, option or share unit of the Delaware corporation and the par value of our common stock was adjusted to $0.0001. All directors and officers of the Colorado corporation held the same position within the Delaware corporation on the date of reincorporation.
Fiscal Year 2022 Highlights
COVID-19 Response
Beginning in fiscal year 2020 and continuing throughout fiscal year 2022, we pivoted our business operations to overcome a variety of challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. During fiscal year 2022, we continued to provide successful virtual events and trainings, including twice-weekly online training events, and have seen a high level of engagement and attendance from our independent distributors, with hundreds of attendees on average and over 2,000 attendees at some meetings. We invested in incentives and promotions designed to build and maintain engagement with our independent distributors in lieu of in-person events. Last year, we shifted all our employees to work from home and accelerated our adoption of technology. In fiscal year 2022, we began a hybrid model with our employees working from home a few days a week, and in the office a few days a week. We remain focused on being digital first and committed to increasing our investments into digital technologies and tools for independent distributors and employees to function effectively in the current hybrid working environment. Further, we completed a full evaluation of our supply chain and identified and mitigated risks resulting from the pandemic and, to date, our customers and independent distributors have experienced only minimal impact across our supply chain.
New Product Offerings
 In fiscal year 2022, we launched several new products. In October 2021, we launched IC Bright®. IC Bright® combines macular carotenoids with vitamins and key ingredients that effectively support eye and brain health. It also helps reduce eye fatigue and strain from use of digital devices, helps promote healthy levels of essential proteins for the brain, and may help support normal sleep patterns, which can be disrupted by blue light exposure. In June 2022, we launched TrueScience® Liquid Collagen, the first consumable supplement in the TrueScience category. It has been formulated specifically to activate, 
replenish, and maintain the body’s production of collagen on the cellular level, supporting skin firmness and elasticity for healthy, glowing skin from within. We also launched several limited time seasonal flavors of Axio® during the fiscal year 2022.
Several products also were introduced into new markets in fiscal year 2022: 
•Australia introduced IC Bright®, Body Wash, Body Lotion; 
•Canada—IC Bright®, Daily Wellness, Refining Mask; 
•Europe and Hong Kong—IC Bright®, Daily Wellness;

We continued to develop, enhance and improve the LifeVantage app, which is available for download on the Apple app Store and Google Play store. This custom-developed platform is pioneering new ways for us to interact with our independent distributors and gives us and our distributor leadership valuable insight into the activities of our independent distributor base. The app provides independent distributors with tools and communications that help simplify business activities, provide new distributors with step-by-step instruction for starting their business and improve the prospecting of potential distributors and customers. 
Nutrigenomic Culture & Activating Wellness 
We have continued to simplify our nutrigenomic story, emphasizing that it activates and empowers the body to work better by using nutrients to turn natural internal processes on or off and help support vibrant health at any age. Nutrigenomics and cellular activation are cutting-edge trends in our industry that support our unique position in the market and leverage our core competencies and existing products. Activation is the guiding principle of our culture and is the key underlying message for our independent distributors and customers. We are capitalizing on this message by highlighting how LifeVantage has used the concept of activation and expanded it to every aspect of our business, with a new brand message of “activating wellness.” By focusing on wellness, we are able to apply activation not only to our products, which support physical, mental, and emotional health, but also our business opportunity, which supports financial, social, and spiritual health. The “activating wellness” message was introduced in fiscal year 2022 and continues to be featured across our communications with our independent distributors and in our brand and marketing materials. Additional marketing and media assets are currently in development to further promote this culture. 
Red Carpet Program
We continued to grow through our red carpet program, which is designed to attract and incentivize experienced direct selling sales leaders who are in transition to join LifeVantage. We remain optimistic that this program will help drive long term revenue growth for our business. We have increased red carpet leadership enrollments and hope to see improved retention and active independent distributor and customer counts as a result of this program.

Scientific Background
The Normal Aging Process
Aging in humans is a complex process driven by diverse changes in genetic, molecular, biochemical, and cellular events. This multifactorial process is ultimately characterized by a gradual decline in physiological functions and in the effectiveness of the intricate network of internal cellular communication referred to as cellular signaling. Theories as to why humans' age include the oxidative stress theory, the mitochondrial theory, and the sirtuin theory. 
Oxidative Stress Theory of Aging and the Nrf2 Pathway
The oxidative stress theory of aging states that as humans age, we accumulate free radicals and other oxidants. If left unchecked, this oxidative stress can lead to serious consequences to the cell. Oxidative stress can ultimately lead to oxidative damage from attacks and damage to essential biological structures of the cell which results in compromised cellular function.
Antioxidants are the cell’s primary defense against free radicals and other oxidants. There are two major classes of antioxidants: 1) dietary antioxidants obtained through food and nutritional supplements and 2) endogenous antioxidants produced by the body. A 2013 review of the scientific literature led by the United States National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health concluded that “rigorous trials of antioxidant supplements in large numbers of people have not found that high doses of antioxidant supplements prevent disease.” Thus, much attention has shifted to the body’s endogenous antioxidant and detoxification systems. Endogenous antioxidants are antioxidants made by the body and are the primary line of defense against oxidative stress. In general, endogenous antioxidants either prevent oxidants from being formed, or remove them from the body. Endogenous antioxidants form a complex network of antioxidant metabolites and enzymes. These networks work together, throughout the cell, to neutralize oxidants and protect important biological structures from oxidative damage.
Endogenous antioxidants can also be upregulated in times of increasing oxidative stress. The Nrf2 cellular signaling pathway is the primary pathway for upregulating endogenous antioxidant and other detoxification pathways. With age, the activity of this Nrf2 cellular signaling pathway has been shown to decrease – both in its ability to sense oxidative threats and ultimately upregulate its target genes.
Mitochondrial Theory of Aging and the NRF1 Pathway
Mitochondria are membrane-bound cellular organelles that generate most of the chemical energy needed to power the cell's biochemical reactions. The mitochondria produce energy by breaking down food that has been ingested and capturing high-energy electrons in the process. When mitochondria are functioning properly, they harness the energy of these electrons to 
produce energy for the cell. At the end of this process, the mitochondria attach these electrons to molecular oxygen that ultimately get detoxified to water. However, this process is not perfectly efficient and, even in young, healthy mitochondria, electrons can escape, potentially forming free radicals and other oxidants. 
The mitochondrial theory of aging states that as humans age, mitochondria function less efficiently, producing less energy and more free radicals and other oxidants. The reduction in energy production compromises cellular function. The increase in free radicals and other oxidants in turn damage structures of the cell, including the mitochondria. This mitochondrial damage goes on to further compromise mitochondrial function leading to a downward spiral of decreased mitochondrial efficiency and increased production of free radicals and other oxidants. This process ultimately contributes to an increase in the overall cellular burden of oxidative stress and otherwise compromises cellular function through decreased energy production.
A major cellular signaling pathway believed to be involved in mitochondrial health is NRF1 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 1). The NRF1 cellular signaling pathway, directly or indirectly, regulates a number of genes involved in mitochondrial health, turnover, and biogenesis. Nrf1 (Nuclear Respiratory Factor-1) is a protein believed to activate the expression of key genes involved in metabolism, cellular growth, energy production, and mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication. Together with Nrf2, Nrf1 also provides the essential function of coordinating gene expression between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. An additional protein shown to support mitochondrial health is PGC1-alpha (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1-alpha). PGC1-alpha has been shown to regulate energy metabolism and is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover. 
Sirtuin Theory of Aging and the NAD Pathway
The sirtuin theory of aging developed from studies examining the health benefits of caloric restriction. Caloric restriction is the process whereby caloric intake is restricted by as much as 40 to 60 percent. In numerous experimental models, animals put on calorically restricted diets experienced significant increases in maximum lifespan. Numerous studies have concluded that a family of proteins called the “sirtuins” are required for the increase in lifespan brought on by caloric restriction.
When the physiology of humans undergoing caloric restriction was examined, a number of health benefits were discovered. As researchers began to understand the molecular biology of these sirtuins, they found that the enzymatic activity for most of them required the molecule NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). NAD+ is an essential molecule for many biochemical reactions, most notably metabolism of food for energy in the mitochondria.
Taken together, these findings are intriguing because now there is a direct link between metabolism and healthy longevity. When energy intake is normal, the primary role of NAD+ is for energy production. However, when NAD+ levels increase, either due to restricting calories or increasing the cellular production of NAD+, it becomes a signaling molecule to activate sirtuins and other health promoting mechanisms within the cell. 
Research and Development
Historically, we have focused our research and development efforts on creating and supporting scientifically validated products under the LifeVantage®, Protandim®, TrueScience®, Petandim®, Axio®, and PhysIQ federation of brands. We anticipate that our future research and development efforts will be focused on creating, developing and evaluating new products that are consistent with our commitment to provide quality, scientifically-validated products that activate and empower the body’s ability to work better. We intend to build on our foundation of nutrigenomics with products that activate gene or cell pathways targeting specific benefit areas, provide real results, and are an essential and enjoyable part of everyday life. We are also exploring ways to expand our product delivery systems beyond primarily tablets and capsules, starting with the new TrueScience® Liquid Collagen shots introduced this year. LifeVantage remains committed to helping people look and feel healthy and vibrant at any age by combating sources of premature aging or declining health.
Product Overview
Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer®
Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® is a patented dietary supplement that has been shown in clinical trials to reduce the age-dependent increase in markers of oxidative stress and has also been shown to provide substantial benefits to combat the variety of negative health effects linked to oxidative stress.
Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® combats oxidative stress by increasing the body’s natural antioxidant protection at the gene level. The unique blend of phytonutrients in Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® signals the activation of Nrf2 to increase production of antioxidant enzymes, specifically superoxide dismutase and catalase, and other cell-protective gene products. The body's internally produced antioxidant enzymes provide a better defense against oxidative stress than externally derived sources of antioxidants such as Vitamin C and Vitamin E. Unlike externally derived sources of antioxidants, these enzymes are “catalytic,” which means these enzymes are not used up upon neutralizing free radicals.
We hold multiple U.S. patents related to Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer®. We believe these patents set Protandim® apart from other dietary supplements and protect the original formula as well as certain formula modifications we could create to extend our Protandim® product line. We sell Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® in three formulas around the world.
Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® has been, and is expected to continue to be, the subject of numerous independent scientific studies at various universities and research facilities including Ohio State University, Louisiana State University, University of Colorado Denver, Virginia Commonwealth University, Colorado State University, Texas Tech University and the National Institute on Aging. The results of these studies have been published in a variety of peer-reviewed scientific journals, including Free Radical Biology & Medicine, Enzyme Research, Circulation-the scientific journal of the American Heart Association, American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology, PLoS One, Journal of Dietary Supplements, Molecular Aspects of Medicine, Oxidative Medicine and Cell Longevity, Exercise & Sports Science Reviews, Clinical Pharmacology, the FASEB Journal, and the Journal of Applied Physiology.
Protandim® NRF1 Synergizer®
Protandim® NRF1 Synergizer® is a dietary supplement which was formulated to strengthen the mitochondria, the powerhouse of all cells, for better cellular health. It is designed to work in tandem with our flagship Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® and further enhance the body's internal ability to naturally produce antioxidants and reduce the effects of cellular stress. Protandim® NRF1 Synergizer® activates NRF1, a protein that regulates the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription, translation and repair. The unique blend of ingredients in Protandim® NRF1 Synergizer® supports the mitochondria to slow cellular aging and increase cellular energy.
Protandim® NAD Synergizer®
Sirtuin activity naturally declines by as much as 60 percent as humans age. Research has long shown that sirtuin activity can be increased by as much as 94 percent through drastic caloric restriction. Protandim® NAD Synergizer® is a dietary supplement which was specifically formulated to target the biochemical pathways involved in the synthesis and recycling of a specific molecule called NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and has been shown to double sirtuin activity in just 24 hours. Sirtuin activity has been linked to multiple health benefits. In addition to being responsible for cellular autophagy (cellular cleanup and renewal process), sirtuins help improve mental focus and concentration, support positive mood and motivation, boost mental and physical energy, aid in maintaining cholesterol levels already in a healthy range, support a healthy vascular system, and promote healthy longevity. 
The Protandim® Family of Products and Nutrigenomics
Nutrigenomics is the study of how foods and individual nutrients can affect gene expression and how genes can also affect how humans metabolize food. Specific combinations of nutrients that engage cellular signaling and biochemical pathways are believed to unlock specific health mechanisms in human cells, tissues, and organs. Specifically, by looking at the cellular signaling and biochemical pathways known to be implicated in the aging process, we have formulated products to address various effects of aging utilizing nutrigenomics. This is the rationale behind the Protandim® family of products, which were formulated from specific combinations of nutrients with US Patents Pending to support natural cellular functions by targeting specific cellular signaling and biochemical pathways related to oxidative stress, optimal mitochondrial function, and activation of the sirtuin family of proteins.

An independent distributor in our company is an independent contractor who participates in our direct sales opportunity by enrolling through the independent distributor contract process and selling our products. Independent distributors may purchase our products and sell them to others either directly or through our company. We believe our independent distributors are typically entrepreneurs, who believe in our products and desire to earn income through sales commissions and by building their own distributorship business. Many of our independent distributors are attracted by the opportunity to sell unique, scientifically-validated products without incurring significant start-up costs. Independent distributors sign a contract with us that includes a requirement that they adhere to strict policies and procedures. Independent distributors may purchase product from us for individual and family consumption and for demonstrations, samples and retailing opportunities. 
While we provide support, product samples, brochures, magazines, the LifeVantage app and other sales and marketing materials, independent distributors are primarily responsible for their sales to customers and for attracting, enrolling and educating new independent distributors about the benefits of our products and sales compensation plan. An independent distributor creates multiple levels of compensation by selling our products and enrolling new independent distributors who sell our products. These newly enrolled independent distributors form a “downline” for the independent distributor who enrolled them. If downline independent distributors enroll new independent distributors or customers who purchase our products, they create additional levels of compensation and their downline independent distributors remain in the same downline network as the original enrolling independent distributor. We pay commissions only upon the sale of our products. We do not pay commissions for enrolling independent distributors.
We define “active independent distributors” as those independent distributors who have purchased product from us for retail sales or personal consumption during the prior three months. We had approximately 63,000 active independent distributors as of each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.
Independent Distributor Compensation
We believe our sales compensation plan is one of the more financially rewarding in the direct selling industry. Our percentage of sales paid to independent distributors as sales compensation and incentives is one of the highest percentages reported in the direct selling industry. Some elements of our sales compensation plan are paid daily, to eligible distributors, and others are paid weekly or monthly. We believe this gives us a competitive advantage and helps retain new distributors by allowing them to receive some sales commissions in a more timely manner from their sales efforts. Our sales compensation plan is intended to appeal to a broad cross-section of people, including those seeking to supplement family income, start a home-based business or pursue entrepreneurial opportunities full- or part-time. Our independent distributors earn sales commissions on product sales to their personally enrolled customers and independent distributors and the product sales to customers and independent distributors within their sales organization, or "downline." Our independent distributors can also earn money by purchasing product from us and selling that product to others at their chosen retail price. We pay sales commissions in the local currency of the independent distributor’s home country.
Independent Distributor Motivation and Training
Our revenue depends in part on the sales success and productivity of our independent distributors. We provide tools, training and technology designed to increase our independent distributors' sales productivity and increase their potential for sales success. We offer training and business development opportunities to our independent distributors, including the following:
•Playbook: Professionally-designed training materials independent distributors can utilize in their sales efforts;
•Digital Training: Our digital audio series presented by our independent distributor leaders provides training and tips on becoming more sales productive distributors;
•Elite Academy, Global Convention, and Other Company-Sponsored Training: We hold regularly occurring live and virtual company-sponsored events intended to provide sales training and motivation to our independent distributors, in addition to twice-weekly virtual distributor trainings; 
•Promotions and Incentive Trips: We hold special sales promotions and incentive trips from time to time in order to motivate our independent distributors to accomplish specific sales goals; and
•Mobile Application: The LifeVantage app was designed to allow users to conduct any aspect of their business on a single platform from anywhere in the world. Ultimately, through artificial intelligence and machine learning, we expect that the app will be able to guide users on what to share, when to share it, and with whom to maximize their sales potential. 
We are continuing to evaluate new ways in which to incorporate new technology and sales training opportunities to improve distributor sales success and commissions.
Distributor Compliance Activities
Given that our independent distributors are independent contractors, we do not control or direct their promotional efforts. We do, however, require that our independent distributors abide by policies and procedures that require them to act in an ethical manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As a member of the United States Direct Selling Association and similar organizations in many of the markets where we do business, we are also subject to the ethical business practices and consumer service standards required by the industry's code of ethics. 
Independent distributors represent to us that their receipt of sales commissions is based on their product sales and by product sales of other LifeVantage distributors in their personal marketing organization. We must produce or pre-approve all sales aids used by distributors, such as brochures and online materials. Products may be promoted only through sales materials produced or approved by us. Independent distributors may not use our trademarks or other intellectual property without our written consent.
We monitor and systematically review alleged distributor misbehavior through our internal distributor compliance department. If we determine one of our independent distributors has violated any of our policies and procedures, we first attempt to educate, but may discipline or terminate the distributor’s rights to sell or distribute our products when appropriate. When necessary, we have brought legal action against distributors, or former distributors, to enforce our policies and procedures. Short of termination or legal action, and in addition to educating, we may impose sanctions against distributors whose actions are in violation of our policies and procedures. Such sanctions may include warnings, probation, withdrawal or denial of an award, suspension of privileges of a distributorship, fines and/or withholding of commissions until specified conditions are satisfied, or other appropriate injunctive relief.
Customers
Customers purchase products directly from us at either our non-subscription (list) pricing for one-time purchases or our subscription price on a monthly subscription basis for personal consumption, without the ability to resell or earn commissions from the purchase or sale of such products. A customer may decide to enroll as an independent distributor at any time if they become interested in selling the product. We believe our customers are a great source of word-of-mouth advertising for our products. We also believe our large base of customers validates the health benefits of our products.
We define an “active customer” as a customer who has purchased product from us within the prior three months. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately 93,000 and 107,000 active customers, respectively.
Sales of Our Products
We accept orders for our products through our own website at www.lifevantage.com and through personalized websites we provide to our independent distributors, which we refer to as “Virtual Offices”. Orders placed through Virtual Offices and through our website are processed daily at our fulfillment centers, where orders are shipped directly to the consumer.
We offer toll-free numbers for our independent distributors and our customers to order product or ask questions. Our customer service representatives assist customers in placing orders through our web order processing system, answering questions, tracking packages, and initiating refunds. The customer service representatives receive extensive training about our products and our direct selling business model. LifeVantage customers and independent distributors generally pay for products by credit card, prior to shipment, and as a result, we carry minimal accounts receivable.
Seasonality
In addition to general economic factors, we are impacted by seasonal factors and trends such as major cultural events and vacation patterns. We believe that direct selling in the United States and Japan is also generally negatively impacted during our first fiscal quarter, from July 1 through September 30, when many individuals, including our independent distributors, traditionally take vacations. The timing and size of our training events and incentive trips can also cause revenue and expense to fluctuate in the periods that they are held.
Although our product launch process may vary by market, we may introduce new products to our customers and independent distributors through limited-time offers and promotions. The limited-time offers and promotions typically generate significant activity and a high level of sales and purchasing, which may result in a higher than normal increase in revenue during the quarter of the limited-time offer and skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons. Similarly, company events for independent distributors typically generate a higher than normal increase in revenue. The timing of these events can also skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons.
Geographic Information
We sell our products in the United States, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Taiwan, Austria, Spain, Ireland, Belgium, New Zealand, Singapore, and the Philippines. We also sell our products in a number of countries to customers for personal consumption only. In addition, we sell our products in China through our approved e-commerce business model. In fiscal year 2022, revenue generated in the United States accounted for approximately 63% of our total revenue and revenue generated from Japan accounted for approximately 18% of our total revenue. For reporting purposes, we generally divide our markets into two geographic regions: the Americas region and the Asia/Pacific & Europe region. The following table sets forth net revenue information by region for the periods indicated (in thousands):

 | For the fiscal years ended June 30,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020 
Americas | $ | 138,323 | | | 67.0 | % | | $ | 154,655 | | | 70.2 | % | $ | 166,336 | | 71.4 | %
Asia/Pacific & Europe | 68,037 | | | 33.0 | % | | 65,526 | | | 29.8 | % | | 66,579 | | 28.6 | %
Total | $ | 206,360 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 220,181 | | | 100.0 | % | $ | 232,915 | | 100.0 | %

Additional comparative revenue and related financial information is presented in the section captioned "Segment Information" in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
Marketing
We utilize our network of independent distributors located throughout the United States, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Taiwan, Austria, Spain, Ireland, Belgium, New Zealand, Singapore, and the Philippines to market and sell our products. In addition, we utilize our network of in-country social marketers to market and sell our US products in China through our cross-border e-commerce business model. In addition, we have in-house sales, marketing, IT, and customer service groups dedicated to supporting our independent distributors. Support includes training and education, personalized assistance, in-person and digital events, recognition, incentives and promotions, digital and social media content, press coverage, regular communications, as well as a full suite of marketing assets, including content for their websites. 
Raw Materials and Manufacturing
We outsource the primary manufacturing, fulfillment, and shipping components of our business to third-party companies we believe possess a high degree of expertise. We believe outsourcing provides us access to advanced manufacturing process capabilities and expertise without incurring fixed costs associated with manufacturing our own products in house.
We currently outsource the manufacture of our products to multiple third-party contract manufacturers. Our contract manufacturers have a legal obligation to comply with the current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations that are applicable to those who manufacture, package, label and hold dietary supplements and personal care products. Additionally, we are subject to regulations that, among other things, obligate us to know what and how manufacturing activities are performed so that we can make decisions related to whether the packaged and labeled product conforms to our established specifications and whether to approve and release product for distribution to consumers. We maintain and qualify alternative manufacturing options in order to keep our costs low, maintain the quality of our products, and prepare for unanticipated spikes in demand or manufacturing failure. Our contract manufacturers deliver products to our fulfillment centers based on our purchase orders.
We acquire raw materials for our products from third-party suppliers. Although we generally have good relationships with our suppliers, we believe we could replace any of our current suppliers without great difficulty or significant increase to our cost of goods sold. We also have ongoing relationships with secondary and tertiary suppliers. Please refer to "Risk Factors - High quality material for our products may be difficult to obtain or expensive" for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our sourcing of raw materials.
Product Liability and Other Insurance
We have product liability insurance coverage for our products that we believe is adequate for our needs. We also maintain commercial property and liability coverage, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, workers compensation coverage and cyber information security risk insurance policies as well as foreign and other miscellaneous coverage. 
Intellectual Property
We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect our intellectual property through patent protection, trademarks and trade secrets, licensed rights and contractual protections, and intend to continue to develop a strong brand identity for our company and our products. 
Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® is a proprietary, patented dietary supplement formulation for enhancing antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase and catalase. The patents and patent applications protecting its formulations are held by LifeVantage Corporation or our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lifeline Nutraceuticals Corporation. Our intellectual property is covered, in part, by many issued U.S. patents. Our patents and patent applications claim the benefit of priority of multiple U.S. provisional patent applications, the earliest of which was filed on March 23, 2004, and relate to compositions, methods of use, and methods of manufacture of various compositions, including those embodied by the Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® formulation. The expected duration of our patent protection via some granted patents for Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® is at least through approximately March 2025 and we continue to research and file new composition and method patents in the U.S. for enhanced and improved product formulations that will extend our patent protection for a variety of product formulations and methods. During fiscal year 2018, we received other patents for personal care or skin care products. These patents expire approximately February 2036. In fiscal year 2021, we filed additional U.S. patents that, if granted, will protect the combined effects and synergistic benefits of the Protandim® Nrf1 Synergizer®; Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® and Protandim® NAD Synergizer® products when these three products (also called the Tri-Synergizer™ pack) are used together.
We continue to protect our products and brands using trademarks. We have filed and successfully procured registered trademarks for our key brands consisting of Protandim®, LifeVantage®, and TrueScience® in many countries around the world, and we have pending trademark applications for these and other marks in many other countries. We anticipate seeking protection in other countries, as we deem appropriate.
In order to protect the confidentiality of our intellectual property, including trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, it is our policy to limit access to such information to those who require access in order to perform their functions and to enter into agreements with employees, consultants and vendors to contractually protect such information.
Competition
Direct Selling Companies
We compete with other direct selling companies, many of which have longer operating histories and greater visibility, name recognition and financial resources than we do. We also compete with newer direct selling companies that may attempt to solicit our distributors by offering the possibility of a more financially rewarding opportunity or by being among the company's early distributor base. We compete for new distributors with these companies on the basis of our business opportunity, product offerings, sales compensation plan, management and our operations. In order to successfully compete in the direct selling industry and attract and retain quality distributors, we must maintain the attractiveness of our business opportunity, product offerings and sales compensation plan.
Dietary Supplement Market
We compete with other companies that sell dietary supplements. We believe the dietary supplement market is highly fragmented and competitive. We believe competition in the dietary supplement market is based primarily on quality, price, efficacy of products, brand name and recognition of product benefits. In the dietary supplement industry, our competition includes numerous nutritional supplement companies, pharmaceutical companies and packaged food and beverage companies. Many of these companies have broader product lines, larger sales volumes and greater financial resources than we do. Additionally, some of these companies are able to compete more effectively due to greater vertical integration. Increased 
competition in the dietary supplement market could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Nrf2 Activators
In the last few years we have seen the number of products marketed as Nrf2 activators increase. We anticipate the number of products that claim to activate Nrf2 will continue to increase as the technology becomes more popular and more broadly accepted. 
Direct Antioxidants
Vitamin C, Vitamin E, other vitamin/mineral antioxidants, and other sources of externally derived antioxidants may be considered competitors of Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® but they are mechanistically distinct from Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer®. These other sources of antioxidants do not increase the body’s elimination of oxidants using internal antioxidant enzymes. Our research indicates that Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® increases production of anti-fibrotic gene products including antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, within the cells of the body. We believe that the body’s internally produced antioxidant enzymes provide a better defense against oxidative stress than externally derived sources of antioxidants.
Oral Superoxide Dismutase and Catalase
There are many companies performing research into antioxidants. Several companies sell oral forms of superoxide dismutase and catalase. Although we believe Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® is a superior alternative to oral forms of superoxide dismutase and catalase, these products do compete with Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® in the marketplace. We anticipate additional companies will likely develop, purchase or in-license products that are competitive with Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer®.
Omega Fatty Acid Products
There are many companies that market Omega supplements, including Omega-3. Although LifeVantage® Omega+ contains a unique combination of DHA and EPA Omega-3 fatty acids, Omega-7 fatty acids, and Vitamin D3, we anticipate additional companies will likely develop products that are competitive with LifeVantage® Omega+. 
Probiotic Products
There are many companies that market probiotic supplements and we anticipate additional companies will likely continue to develop products that are competitive with our LifeVantage® ProBio supplement. 
Eye Health Products
There are many companies that market eye health supplements and we anticipate additional companies will likely continue to develop products that are competitive with our IC Bright®. 
Personal Skin Care Market
In the personal skin care market, we compete principally with large, well-known cosmetics companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through retail establishments. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and brand recognition than we do. We believe, however, we can compete with these larger companies by leveraging our direct selling model and emphasizing our unique, science-based, Nrf2 and CBD enhanced skin and personal care products. We also now compete in the growing global liquid collagen market and believe we can compete with our triple action formula that has been shown to deliver visible results in only 30 days as it activates, replenishes and maintains collagen levels. Our product is a unique blend featuring sustainably sourced, hydrolyzed fish collagen that delivers 10 different types of peptides – significantly more than most competitive products – plus a unique red quinoa extract that has been shown to up regulate genes associated with collagen production and down regulate those that produce enzymes that break down collagen. 
Personal Hair Care Market
In the personal hair care market, we compete principally with large, well-known hair care companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through retail establishments. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and brand recognition than we do. We believe, however, we can compete with these larger companies by leveraging our direct selling model and emphasizing our unique, science-based hair care products.
Animal Supplement Market
We compete principally with large, well-known companies in the animal supplement market. Most of the companies we compete with in the animal supplement market have broad distribution channels that include retail establishments. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and brand recognition than we do. We believe, however, we can compete with these larger companies by leveraging our direct selling model and emphasizing our unique, science-based animal supplement product.
Energy Drink Market
We compete with large, well-known companies in the energy drink market. Most of the companies we compete with in the energy drink market have broad distribution channels that include big box retail establishments. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and brand recognition than we do. We intend to compete with these larger companies by leveraging our direct selling model and emphasizing our unique, science-based energy drink product. Axio® is a no sugar, low-carbohydrate and low-calorie energy drink that is also non-GMO, gluten-free and vegan. 
Weight Management Market
We compete with large, well-known companies in the weight management market. Most of the companies we compete with in the weight management market have broad distribution channels that include big box retail establishments. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and brand recognition than we do. We intend to compete with these larger companies by leveraging our direct selling model and emphasizing our unique, science-based weight management products.
Regulatory Environment
The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and advertising of our products in the United States are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, as well as comparable state laws.
FDA Regulations and DSHEA
We market our Protandim® products as “dietary supplements” as defined in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, or DSHEA. DSHEA is intended to promote access to safe, quality dietary supplements, and information about dietary supplements. DSHEA established a new framework governing the composition and labeling of dietary supplements. DSHEA does not apply to animal supplements like Petandim®. We are not required to obtain FDA pre-market approval to sell our products in the United States under current laws.
DSHEA permits statements of nutritional support, called “structure-function” statements, to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without FDA marketing approval. Such statements may claim a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease and disclose the prevalence of such disease in the United States, describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans, characterize the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, or describe general well-being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient. Such statements may not expressly or impliedly claim that a dietary supplement is intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease. A company that uses a structure-function statement in labeling must possess evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading and is supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. 
The FDA may assert that a particular structure-function statement that a company is using is an illegal claim; that assertion, normally, is in the form of a warning letter to that company. We have a duty to send to the FDA a notice that lists each new structure-function statement made by us; we are obligated to send that notice within 30 days after the first marketing of a supplement with such a statement.
DSHEA also permits certain scientific literature, for example a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication, to be used in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement to consumers without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. However, such literature must not be false or misleading, the literature may not promote a particular manufacturer or brand of dietary supplement and it must include a balanced view of the available scientific information on the subject matter, among other requirements.
The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, or CVM, is responsible for enforcing the portion of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the Act, that relates to animal supplements, like our Petandim® product. CVM's primary responsibility in enforcing the Act is to ensure that animal supplements are safe, effective, and can be manufactured to a consistent standard. CVM has taken the position that DSHEA does not apply to products intended for animals, but it is clear that products like Petandim® are under FDA jurisdiction.
Our Petandim® product follows the labeling rules of the National Animal Supplement Council (NASC) of which LifeVantage is a member. Under the NASC rules, Petandim® is classified as a dosage form animal health product.
While we exercise care in our formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and advertising of our products, we cannot guarantee the FDA will never inform us that the FDA believes some violation of law has occurred either by us or by our independent distributors. Any allegations of our non-compliance may result in time-consuming and expensive defense of our activities. The FDA’s normal course of action is to issue a warning letter if it believes that a product is misbranded or adulterated. The responsive action requested by the FDA differs depending upon the nature of the product and claims in question. Typically, the FDA expects a written response within 15 working days of the receipt of a warning letter. The warning letter is public information posted on the FDA’s web site. That information could affect our relationships with our customers/consumers, investors, independent distributors, vendors, and employees. Warning letters also often spark private class action litigation under state consumer protection statutes. The FDA could also order compliance activities, such as an inspection of our facilities and products, and could file a civil lawsuit in which an arrest warrant (seizure) could be issued as to some or all of our products. In extraordinary cases, we could be named a defendant and sued for declaratory and injunctive relief.
FTC Regulations
Advertising and marketing of our products in the United States are also subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act. Among other things, the FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair false or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. The FTC Act also makes it illegal to disseminate or cause to be disseminated any false advertisement for “food, drugs, devices, services, or cosmetics." The FTC Act provides that disseminating any false advertisement pertaining to foods, which would include dietary supplements, is an unfair or deceptive act or practice. An advertiser is required to have competent and reliable scientific evidence for all express and implied health-related product claims at the time the claims are first made. We are required to have adequate scientific substantiation for all material advertising claims made for our products in the United States. The FTC routinely reviews websites to identify questionable advertising claims and practices. Competitors sometimes inform the FTC when they believe other competitors are violating the FTC Act and consumers may also notify the FTC of what they believe may be wrongful advertising. The FTC may initiate a non-public investigation that focuses on our advertising claims, which usually involves non-public pre-lawsuit extensive formal discovery. Such an investigation may be very expensive to defend, be lengthy, and result in a publicly disclosed Consent Decree, which is a settlement agreement. If no settlement can be reached, the FTC may start an administrative proceeding or a federal court lawsuit against us and/or our principal officers. The FTC often seeks to recover from the defendants, whether in a Consent Decree or a proceeding, any or all of the following: (i) consumer redress in the form of monetary relief or disgorgement of profits; (ii) significant reporting requirements for several years; and (iii) injunctive relief. In addition, most, if not all, states have statutes prohibiting deceptive and unfair acts and practices. The requirements under these state statutes are similar to those of the FTC Act.
The National Advertising Division, or NAD, of the national Better Business Bureau, a non-governmental not-for-profit organization through its Advertising Self-Regulatory Council, or ASRC, is also actively engaged in conducting investigations, called inquiries, which are focused on determining whether the requisite claim substantiation standard exists for advertising claims, including specific structure-function claims. Although the results of each inquiry or proceeding are not binding on the recipient, they are posted on NAD’s website, and the NAD often refers cases to the FTC, if the advertisers do not agree to modify their advertising in conformance with the NAD decision. We have been the subject of a NAD proceeding in 2008 and 2009, which was concluded in 2009.
In January 2019, the Direct Selling Self-Regulatory Council (DSSRC) was introduced. This program monitors the entire direct selling channel — including Direct Selling Association member companies and non-members. The DSSRC provides impartial monitoring, enforcement, and dispute resolution regarding product claims or income representations (including lifestyle claims) disseminated by direct selling companies and their sales force members (distributors). The failure of a company to resolve DSSRC complaints will ultimately result in the DSSRC reporting the matter to the FTC, which may or may not pursue enforcement action in any given case. 
Regulation of Direct Selling Activities
Direct selling activities are regulated by the FTC, as well as various federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States and foreign countries. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as “pyramid” schemes, which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without sufficient emphasis on product sales. The laws and regulations may often:
•require us or our independent distributors to register with governmental agencies;
•impose caps on the amount or type of sales commission we can pay;
•impose reporting requirements; and
•require that we ensure, among other things, that our independent distributors maintain levels of product sales to qualify to receive sales commissions and that our independent distributors are being compensated primarily for sales of products and not primarily for recruiting additional participants.
The laws and regulations governing direct selling are modified from time to time, and, like other direct selling companies, we may be subject from time to time to government investigations related to our direct selling activities. This may require us to make changes to our business model and our sales compensation plan.
State Regulations
In addition to United States federal regulation, each state has enacted its own food and drug laws. We may receive requests to supply information regarding our sales or advertising to state regulatory agencies. We remain subject to the risk that, in one or more of our present or future markets, our products, sales, and advertising could be found non-compliant with state laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general. In addition, these laws and regulations could affect our ability to enter new markets.
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA, was enacted in 2011 and is now part of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA. The FSMA is a comprehensive set of laws that gives the FDA considerable authority with respect to the prevention of food contamination and the serious problems associated with such contamination. Among other things, it does the following:
•gives the FDA explicit authority to compel a recall if the FDA believes there is a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death;
•places strict obligations on food and dietary supplement importers to verify that food from foreign suppliers is not adulterated or misbranded; and
•provides whistle blower protection for employees of conventional food or dietary supplement companies who provide information to governmental authorities about violations of the FFDCA.
International Regulations
In addition to the regulations applicable to our activities in the United States, all other markets in which we operate our business regulate our products under a variety of statutory and regulatory schemes. We typically market our Protandim® line of products in international markets as foods, health foods or dietary supplements under applicable regulatory regimes. However, because of varied regulations, some products or ingredients that are recognized as a “food” in certain markets may be treated as a “pharmaceutical” or equivalent in other markets. In the event a product, or an ingredient in a product, is classified as a drug or pharmaceutical product in any market, we will generally not be able to distribute that product through our independent distributors channel because of pre-marketing approval requirements and strict regulations applicable to drug and pharmaceutical products. In Japan, for example, ashwagandha was determined to be inappropriate for inclusion in food products. Ashwagandha is one of the ingredients in Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer®. While we disagree with the assessment of ashwagandha by Japanese regulatory authorities, we are restricted from selling a formulation of Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® that contains ashwagandha in Japan. As such, we reformulated Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® for the Japan market to exclude ashwagandha and include black pepper extract. This reformulated Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® was introduced in Japan in fiscal year 2013.
Similarly, our other markets outside the United States regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy of our products and require adequate substantiation of claims. As such, we are unable to claim that any of our products will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent diseases. For example, in Japan, Protandim® Nrf2 Synergizer® is considered a food product, which significantly limits our ability to make claims regarding the product. If marketing materials make claims that exceed the scope of allowed claims for dietary supplements, regulatory authorities could deem our products to be unapproved drugs and we could experience substantial harm.
Our business model is also subject to regulatory frameworks that may limit or significantly alter the way business is done in foreign markets vis-à-vis the United States. For example, our marketing of products or business opportunity as a distributor in the United Kingdom differs significantly from marketing to United States customers and distributors. Consequently, we may experience additional costs and delays in entering or continuing to do business in foreign markets in order to comply with local regulations.
Potential FDA and Other Regulation
We could become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA, FTC, or other federal, state, local or international regulatory authorities, to the repeal of laws or regulations that we consider favorable, such as DSHEA, or to more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. Because of negative publicity associated with some adulterated or misbranded supplements, including pharmaceutical drugs marketed as dietary supplements, there has been an increased movement in the United States and other markets to expand the regulation of dietary supplements, which could impose additional restrictions or requirements in the future. In recent years, there also has been increased pressure in the United States to further regulate cosmetics. In general, the regulatory environment is becoming more complex with increasingly strict regulations. In March of 2022, the FTC gave notice of a new potential rulemaking concerning false, misleading and unsubstantiated earnings claims. The Direct Selling Association, which represents many direct selling companies publicized its filed comments and cited “already robust ethics and self-regulation in direct selling.” The Direct Selling Association asserted that the DSSRC “has a strong track record of monitoring the market for potentially problematic claims and engaging in quick and effective follow-up to address the relatively rare instances where it finds that distributors are making questionable claims, usually in social media.”
The Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires us to report to the FDA all serious adverse events and to maintain for six years, records of all adverse events, whether or not serious. An adverse event is defined as any health-related event associated with the use of a dietary supplement that is adverse. In addition, this law requires the label of each dietary supplement, including our Protandim® products, to include a domestic address or telephone number by which the company selling the product may receive a report of a serious adverse event associated with such product. The labels of our Protandim® products comply with that statutory provision.
Employees
As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, we had 259 and 263 full-time employees, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, 187 of our full-time employees were based in the United States, 31 were based in Japan and a total of 10 were based in the Philippines, 9 in Thailand, 9 in Taiwan, 4 in Mexico, 4 in Australia, 3 in Singapore, 1 in Hong Kong, and 1 in Canada. We do not include our independent distributors in our number of employees because our independent distributors are independent contractors and not employees. We outsource our manufacturing, warehousing and shipping operations.
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
We understand that long-term value creation for stockholders is our core responsibility. We are investing in a number of sustainability initiatives, including reducing the environmental impact of our business activities and products, improving the global human condition, providing a positive working environment and engaging with our stakeholders regarding these initiatives.
Employees: We believe that our employees are an essential asset. We have a dedicated team of professionals that support our customers and independent distributors, work to generate long-term value for our stockholders and contribute to the broader public through charitable programs, including LifeVantage Legacy LLC. In turn, we offer competitive compensation and direct their focus on the long-term goals of our stockholders and independent distributors. We have been named one of the Best Places to Work by the Direct Selling News for six years in a row, which reflects our commitment to create a great work environment for our employees.
Environment: We are committed to reducing our impact on the environment and creating awareness about sustainability. We will strive to improve our environmental performance over time and to initiate additional projects and activities that will further reduce our impacts on the environment. Our commitment to the environment extends to our customers, our independent distributors, our employees, and the global communities in which we operate. We comply with applicable environmental regulations and strive to prevent pollution whenever possible. We are increasing our efforts to train our employees and independent distributors on our environmental program and empower them to contribute and participate. We are committed to continually improve over time by striving to measure our environmental impacts and by setting goals to reduce these impacts each year. Some examples of our efforts include:
•Created a digital starter kit to replace the prior hard copy version in an effort to reduce the use of materials like paper and plastic;
•Utilized furniture in our new office made from 80+% recycled content;
•Designed our corporate office with furniture sourced from U.S. Green Building Council and LEED Platinum certified vendor; 
•Included sustainability as one of our corporate core values, and committed to continually look for ways to minimize our impact on the environment including using more easily recycled packaging for the launch of our new products in our TrueScience® line and ensuring the new products score low on the Think Dirty scale;
•Engaged our stakeholders by establishing a sustainability committee comprised of independent distributors to meet periodically during the year to receive feedback on initiatives important to them. This committee met three times during the year and discussed potential sustainability partners, finding more easily recyclable packaging and other packaging concerns;
•Continued a more flexible work from home structure for corporate employees, including positions that are now permanently work from home, reducing our impact on the environment with fewer vehicles on the road commuting to and from the office;
•Implemented an environmental policy using the feedback from our stakeholders to help formalize our focus on sustainability and began using environmental auditing in our selection process for new partners;
•Switched to more easily recyclable bottles and cartons for product packaging, including replacing plastic bags with paper cartons for our energy drink products and using a fully recyclable glass bottle and cap for the recently launched TrueScience® Liquid Collagen product line;
•Began sourcing shipping boxes made from Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) certified corrugate material; 
•Created sharable videos that our independent distributors can use with our sustainability efforts; and
•Focused on working with fish oil suppliers and fisheries who are Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified. 
Social/Community: We believe that our legacy isn’t the past, it’s the future we create. This belief informed our effort to sponsor the formation of LifeVantage Legacy – an independent charitable organization focused on bettering the lives of children throughout the world. LifeVantage Legacy helps the leaders of tomorrow by touching a million lives across the world today. From simply helping a child in need to supporting initiatives that uplift entire communities, our goal is simple - give future generations the support and resources they need to live happier, healthier lives one child at a time. One of the best parts of LifeVantage is our commitment to leaving places better than we find them. 
•For the past 8 years, other than in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during the holidays, employees, independent distributors and their families have traveled to Puerto Penasco, Mexico, and built over 25 homes for families in need.
•In fiscal year 2022, we provided monetary donations through our 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, to those affected by the war in Ukraine, typhoon Odette in the Philippines, relief efforts in Louisiana, USA after hurricane Ida and women's shelters in Orlando, FL and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.
•We have partnered with local refugee foundations to provide needed items for kids and cleaning supplies for their homes.
•At our company-sponsored incentive trips, we make sure to take time and give back to the local communities. At our global convention, those who attended in person tied fleece blankets for local children’s hospitals. At our Elite training event, we spent a day working with a local after school center organizing the building, cleaning and providing new kitchen equipment so that the school could better serve the community, as well as participated in a local cleanup effort at a historic local pond that was impacted by flooding the day before.
•We engaged our stakeholders by establishing a social committee comprised of independent distributors to meet periodically during fiscal 2022 to receive feedback on initiatives important to them. This committee met three times during the year and discussed diversity, inclusive marketing materials and community service opportunities.
•We have a human rights policy to formalize our auditing and commitment to align internationally with human rights philosophies in how we conduct business. LifeVantage began auditing its key partners in fiscal 2022.
•We measured our employee's engagement level and requested anonymous feedback during the fiscal year and implemented changes to address the feedback. We are pleased with being named a Best Place to Work by Direct Selling News (as nominated by our employees) for the sixth year in a row. We have set up monthly lunches between our employees and our executives to continue the culture of asking questions and providing transparency.
Governance: We endeavor to continue to strengthen and improve our corporate governance and executive compensation practices. We adopted an equity ownership policy to reinforce our belief that executives and directors who believe in the future 
of our company should have meaningful equity holdings in LifeVantage. In addition, we adopted a majority standard for the election of directors on our board.
