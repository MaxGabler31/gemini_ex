Item 1. Business
Overview
LivePerson, Inc. (“LivePerson”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”) makes life easier by transforming how people communicate with brands. LiveEngage, the Company’s enterprise-class, cloud-based platform, enables businesses and consumers to connect through conversational interfaces, such as in-app and mobile messaging, while leveraging bots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to increase efficiency. As consumers have reoriented their digital lives around the smartphone, messaging apps have become their preferred communication channel to connect with each other. LivePerson allows brands to align with this new consumer preference, and deploy messaging at scale for customer care, marketing and sales, instead of requiring that consumers use email or call a 1-800 number.
LiveEngage was designed to securely deploy messaging, coupled with bots and AI, at scale for brands with tens of millions of customers and many thousands of customer care agents. LiveEngage powers conversations across each of a brand’s primary digital channels, including mobile apps, mobile and desktop web browsers, short message service (SMS), social media and third-party consumer messaging platforms. Brands can also use LiveEngage to message consumers when they dial a 1-800 number instead of having them navigate interactive voice response systems (IVR) and wait on hold. 
The robust, cloud-based suite of rich mobile messaging and real-time chat offerings features intelligent routing and capacity mapping, customer sentiment, real-time analytics and reporting, content delivery, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, cobrowsing and a sophisticated proactive targeting engine. The platform seamlessly integrates with third-party bots, enabling brands to manage both AI-based agents and human agents from a single console. More than 18,000 businesses, including Adobe, Citibank, EE, HSBC, IBM, L'Oreal, Orange, PNC, and The Home Depot employ our technology to keep pace with rising customer service expectations and to align with preferences for digital communication channels.
According to our internal measures, during 2017, we monitored an average of 2.6 billion visitor sessions per month across our customers’ websites. LivePerson combines this session data with conversational transcripts and other historical, behavioral, and operational information to develop insights into consumer intent and each step of the customer journey, which leads to optimized campaign outcomes for sales and service transactions.
LivePerson’s products, coupled with our domain knowledge, industry expertise and professional services, have been proven to maximize the effectiveness of consumer engagement. Our mobile and online business messaging solutions deliver measurable return on investment by enabling our customers to:

• | increase consumer satisfaction, improve the overall digital experience, and enhance retention and loyalty, while reducing customer service costs;


• | lower operating costs in the contact center by deflecting costly phone and email interactions to messaging, and incorporating agent and consumer-facing bots to further improve agent efficiency;


• | increase mobile app retention and engagement by providing a connected messaging experience and turning an app into an engaging support app;


• | maintain a valued connection with consumers via mobile devices, either through native applications, websites, text messages, or third-party messaging platforms.


• | accelerate sales cycles, increase conversion rates, increase average order value and reduce abandonment by intelligently engaging website visitors;


• | leverage spending that drives visitor traffic by increasing visitor conversions;


• | refine and improve performance by understanding which initiatives deliver the highest rate of return; and


• | increase lead generation by providing a single platform that engages consumers through advertisements and listings on branded and third-party websites.


As a “cloud computing” or software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, LivePerson provides solutions on a hosted basis. This model offers significant benefits over premise-based software, including lower up-front costs, faster implementation, lower total cost of ownership, scalability, cost predictability, and simplified upgrades. Organizations that adopt a fully-hosted, multi-tenant architecture that is maintained by LivePerson eliminate the majority of the time, server infrastructure costs, and IT resources required to implement, maintain, and support traditional on-premise software.
     Our consumer services offering is an online marketplace that connects independent service providers (Experts) who provide information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging with individual consumers (Users). Users seek assistance and advice in various categories including personal counseling and coaching, computers and programming, education and tutoring, spirituality and religion, and other topics.

LivePerson was incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 1995 and the LivePerson service was introduced in November 1998. In April 2000, the company completed an initial public offering and is currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. LivePerson is headquartered in New York City, with U.S. offices in Alpharetta (Georgia) and Mountain View (CA), and international offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, London, Mannheim, Melbourne, Milan, Paris, Ra'anana (Israel), Tel Aviv, Reading (UK), and Tokyo.
Market Opportunity
LivePerson's LiveEngage platform enables intelligent, convenient and secure messaging between brands and consumers through SMS, mobile apps, IVR deflection, websites, Messenger and other conversational messaging interfaces. These brand-to-consumer messaging capabilities provide alternative channels of communication to calling a 1-800 number and empower brands to run business campaigns on their websites and apps that target reduced costs while increasing customer satisfaction, retention and revenue.
Historically, brands have predominantly promoted calling the 1-800 number or using email as the primary means of contact with consumers. According to a 2013 IBM report, approximately 270 billion calls are made to contact centers each year. We believe this practice has created a disconnect with customers, as digital messaging, which sustains a continuous connection between parties and allows individuals to send and respond to messages when it suits their need, has surpassed voice as the consumer's preferred channel of communication. Gartner, a technology research firm, estimates that the proportion of phone-based communication will drop from 41% in 2017 to 12% in 2022. In contrast, WhatsApp and Facebook users combined send more than 60 billion messages a day, and, according to Portio Research, people worldwide were estimated to send an estimated 23 billion text messages a day in 2015. The International Smartphone Mobility Report by mobile data tracking firm Infomate found that Americans spend about 26 minutes a day texting, as compared to six minutes a day on voice calls. A survey by transportation booking app, Hailo, found that making phone calls has dropped to the sixth most popular use of a mobile device, behind sending messages, receiving messages, checking email, surfing the Web, and using the alarm clock. The adoption of messaging has not been constrained to younger generations. According to Experian Marketing Services, adults 55 and older send and receive an average of nearly 500 text messages a month. 
We believe that the challenges with the traditional channel of calling 1-800 numbers are another driver of the shift to messaging. Roughly 50% of calls to 1-800 numbers go unresolved, according to IBM, and a 2014 Harris Interactive survey found that “81% of all consumers agree that it is frustrating to be tied to a phone or computer to wait for customer service help.” Research by enterprise analytics firm Mattersight, reinforces this view, with 74% of consumers feeling that call centers are getting worse or at best staying the same. The risk of poor customer service is material, according to Harris Interactive, which found that 89% of consumers will leave and go to a competitor due to bad customer experiences. According to Forrester Research's Customer Experience Survey, 73% of US online adults say that valuing their time is the most important thing a company can do to provide them with good service. 
We believe that in order to align with consumer communication preferences, improve the customer experience and reduce contact center costs, brands will increasingly promote messaging as an alternative to voice, and that LivePerson will benefit from this communication shift. We believe that messaging has reached an inflection point, as more brands are expanding beyond voice to embrace text and mobile messaging. Based on internal measurements, LivePerson has powered more than one billion real-time digital conversations since its founding. In 2016 and 2017, large brands across the globe, such as Foxtel, Hawaiian Airlines, RBS, Sky and T-Mobile, deployed messaging at scale on LiveEngage through their apps or by redirecting calls out of their IVRs and into SMS. According to a RingCentral survey, “at least 78% of consumers who text wish they could have a text conversation with a business.” An Amdocs global consumer survey had a similar finding, with 76% of consumers stating they would rather use a mobile app than call the contact center. 
Messaging also presents a potential cost savings benefit to brands as compared to voice, as skilled agents can typically manage multiple text-based conversations simultaneously, but only one voice call at a time. The ability to enhance human agents with AI and to add bot agents provides additional opportunities for scale and operating efficiency.
As e-commerce continues to become more mainstream, LivePerson also anticipates stronger demand for intelligent business campaigns that target consumers with messaging on our customers' websites.
According to Forrester Research “74% of U.S. and 65% of European online adults now regularly shop online.” Statista estimates that U.S. online retail sales will nearly double to $638 billion by 2022 from $360 billion in 2016. 
Although brands are investing to capture their share of visitors on the Web, spending to capture sales from those visitors attracted to their sites has lagged and conversion rates have stagnated. According to an eConsultancy report, for every $92 spent by retailers to attract a visitor to their website, approximately $1 is spent on efforts to convert each visitor. We believe that conversion rates can be improved through optimized on-site engagement, and that this represents an opportunity for our messaging solutions on both desktop and mobile channels. According to Forrester Research, 53% of customers are likely to abandon their online 
2

purchases if they can't find quick answers to their questions. LivePerson customers have demonstrated increases in website sales of greater than 20% and boosts in average order value by as much as 35%, while lowering the cost of engagement relative to voice or email. A 2013 Customer Service Benchmark by eDigitalResearch also found that “live chat has the highest satisfaction levels for any customer service channel, with 73%, compared with 61% for email and 44% for phone.”
These drivers are likely a key factor in the steady uptake of campaign-based messaging. According to a 2017 report published by Allied Market Research, the global live chat software market is projected to grow to $987 million by 2023, from $590 million in 2016.
We believe that LiveEngage, LivePerson’s enterprise-class, cloud-based platform, will enable LivePerson to deliver increased value to brands, as the software is purpose-built for AI-assisted and human powered messaging in mobile and online channels, designed for ease of use, and features robust real-time reporting, role-based real-time analytics, predictive intelligence, and innovations in customer satisfaction and connection measurement. In our view, the LiveEngage platform, in concert with our enterprise references, best-in-class scalability and security, domain knowledge, global footprint, consulting organization and customer value managers, uniquely positions LivePerson to optimize the effectiveness of real-time, campaign-based messaging and create a superior alternative to the traditional channel of calling the 1-800 number.
Strategy
The key elements of LivePerson’s business solutions strategy include:
Strengthening Our Position in both Existing and New Markets and Growing Our Recurring Revenue Base. LivePerson plans to continue to develop its market position by increasing its customer base, and expanding within its installed base. We will continue to focus primarily on key target markets: automotive, financial services, retail, technology, telecommunications, and travel/hospitality within both our enterprise and mid-market sectors, as well as the small business (SMB) sector. Healthcare, insurance, real estate and energy utilities are new target industries and natural extensions of our primary target markets. We plan to leverage our new LiveEngage platform to replace a portion of calls traditionally made to 1-800 numbers with text and mobile messaging, and to increase adoption of real-time, campaign-based messaging across our customer’s online properties. We intend to collaborate with our large installed customer base to optimize the value and effectiveness that brands derive from our services. We are also focused on strengthening our recurring revenue stream by signing larger, long-term, and more strategic deals.
One of the key ways we are developing our market position is by hosting customer summits for executive level attendees from our targeted enterprise customer base and prospects. These customer summits feature existing customers that have demonstrated strong success with messaging and bots on LiveEngage. We believe that scaled reference customers advocating the adoption of messaging on LiveEngage to targeted peer groups will be a key driver of our growth. In 2017 we increased the pacing and scale of these summits, a pattern that we expect to continue in 2018. 
 Fuel Increased Usage by Expanding Messaging Channels, Use Cases and Interaction Types. LiveEngage currently supports numerous messaging endpoints, including branded mobile apps, mobile and desktop web browsers, IVRs, SMS, Facebook Messenger and LINE. We intend to increase the number of endpoints supported by the LiveEngage platform to include additional third-party social apps and device-based systems. We also intend to broaden the use cases of LiveEngage across our customer base, to support care, sales, marketing and retail footprints. In addition, LivePerson continues to expand the breadth of interaction types available to customers on the platform. For example, in addition to our broad suite of messaging and real-time chat technologies, customers have access to content delivery, analytics, cobrowse, and PCI compliance, as well as proprietary and third-party bot offerings. LivePerson offers a platform pricing model, which provides businesses access to our entire suite of messaging technologies across their entire agent pool for a pre-negotiated cost per interaction. We believe this model will lead to growth opportunities for LivePerson as customers adopt new messaging channels, use cases and interaction types.
 Leverage Partners to Enhance our Offering. In addition to developing our own applications, we continue to cultivate a partner eco-system capable of offering additional applications and services to our customers. For example, in 2015, we integrated LiveEngage with one of the leading consumer messaging platforms. In 2016, we integrated LiveEngage with one of the leading mobile search ad extensions, enabling consumers to initiate SMS messaging conversations with brands directly out of their mobile search results. In 2017, we launched the LiveEngage for Bots program and we have subsequently integrated LiveEngage with multiple artificial intelligence/bots vendors, including IBM Watson. 
Our offering is vendor agnostic, empowering our customers to manage a mix of different bots, human agents and technologies from one control panel, thereby optimizing contact center efficiency. LivePersons' proprietary and third-party AI/bots enable brands to partially or fully automate communications with their customers. In addition, we have opened up access to our platform and our products with application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow third parties to develop on top of our platform. Customers and partners can utilize these APIs to build our capabilities into their own applications and to enhance our applications with their services. In 2017, we allocated additional resources to supporting partners and we expect this investment to increase as our partner network expands.

     Maintaining Market Leadership in Technology and Security Expertise. As described above, we are devoting significant resources to creating new products and enabling technologies designed to accelerate innovation. In order to better support our customers and to attract the best talent, LivePerson is globalizing research and development. We now have tech centers in Israel; Mannheim, Germany; New York; Atlanta; and Mountain View, California. We evaluate emerging technologies and industry standards and continually update our technology in order to retain our leadership position in each market we serve. We monitor legal and technological developments in the area of information security and confidentiality to ensure our policies and procedures meet or exceed the demands of the world’s largest and most demanding corporations. We believe that these efforts will allow us to effectively anticipate changing customer and consumer requirements in our rapidly evolving industry.
     International Presence. LivePerson is focused on expanding its international revenue contribution, which increased to 37% of total revenue in 2017, from 34% in 2016 and 33% in 2015. LivePerson generated positive results from previous investments in direct sales and services personnel in the United Kingdom and Western Europe. We also continued to focus on expanding our presence in the Asia Pacific region, leveraging our relationships with partners.
     Continuing to Build Brand Recognition. As a pioneer of brand-to-consumer digital messaging, LivePerson enjoys strong brand recognition and credibility. We continue to develop relationships with the media, industry analysts and relevant business associations to enhance awareness of our leadership within the care, sales, tech and marketing industries. With a vision of becoming the leader in messaging, we’ve hosted several private executive events for our customers and prospects, highlighting our expertise and the breadth of our services. These private executive events have led us to close several high-profile deals and we are continuing them throughout 2018. Our focus on connecting large enterprise businesses and their millions of consumers securely and at scale is a primary differentiator for LivePerson and a key component of our marketing strategy. We strategically target decision makers and influencers within several key vertical markets, leveraging customer successes to generate increased awareness and demand for brand-to-consumer messaging. In addition, our brand name may also be visible to both business users and consumers on a brand’s website, within the dialog messaging window. We also engage in digital marketing campaigns that promote our brand on web searches and third-party sites.
      Increasing the Value of Our Service to Our Customers. Leveraging LiveEngage to shift communication between consumers and brands from 1-800 number calls to AI and human-powered messaging is the most important initiative in LivePerson's history. We believe that adoption of LiveEngage will align brands with consumer communication preferences, improve the customer experience and reduce contact center costs. Our platform strategy makes available the full suite of LivePerson’s capabilities through a single solution. In addition, the open architecture of LiveEngage will enable LivePerson to rapidly add new capabilities either directly or through partners. For example, we see opportunities for additional efficiencies in the contact center through the integration of artificial intelligence and bots. Because we directly manage the server infrastructure, we can make new features available to our customers immediately upon release, without customer or end-user installation of software or hardware. Our strategy is to continue to enhance the LiveEngage messaging platform and to leverage the substantial amount of mobile and online consumer data we collect, with the aim of increasing agent efficiency, decreasing customer care costs, improving the customer experience and increasing customer lifetime value.
     Evaluating Strategic Alliances and Acquisitions When Appropriate. We have successfully integrated several acquisitions over the past decade. While we have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, engage in discussions regarding acquisitions or strategic transactions or to acquire other companies that can accelerate our growth or broaden our product offerings, we currently have no binding commitments with respect to any future acquisitions or strategic transactions.

 Sales and Marketing
 Sales
We sell our business products and services by leveraging a common methodology through both direct and indirect sales channels.
Our sales process focuses on how our solutions and industry expertise deliver financial and operational value that support our customers’ strategic initiatives. Our mobile and online messaging solutions are targeted at business executives whose primary responsibility is optimization of customer care, sales and marketing, or optimizing a consumer’s journey across the brand’s digital properties.

LivePerson supports any organization with a company-wide strategic initiative to improve the overall mobile and online consumer experience.
Within the business solutions segment we have aligned our field organization to address the different sales strategies of our target markets:
5

Enterprise and large mid-market. We target large mid-market and enterprise businesses primarily with direct sales and customer success teams. Across the globe we are targeting a select group of brands, many of them already customers, that hold the power to transform customer care. These enterprises have thousands of agents in their contact centers and collectively connect with billions of consumers each year. We leverage thought leadership and related events to showcase our leadership in mobile and online messaging and highlight our successes with existing reference customers. Increasingly, we are also working with large third-party system integrators, technology providers and business process outsourcers to supplement our direct sales effort.
For our large and more complex customers, our sales methodology often begins with research and discovery meetings that enable us to develop a deep understanding of the value drivers and key performance metrics of a prospective customer. We then present an analytical review detailing how our solutions and industry expertise can affect these value drivers and metrics. Once we validate solution capabilities and prove financial return on investment, we transition to a program management model wherein we work hand-in-hand with the customer, providing detailed analysis, measurements and recommendations that help optimize their performance and ensure ongoing program success.
Small business and small mid-market. We target small business and small mid-market customers with a mix of direct, online self-service and third-party partner channels. Our customer acquisition strategy centers on leveraging customer word-of-mouth, our leading brand name, online marketing and partnerships. We also leverage marketing programs and partner resources to promote increased usage and product adoption within these customers.
Indirect Sales. Resources within our organization are focused on developing partnerships to generate revenues via referral partnerships and indirect sales through channel partners. By maximizing market coverage via partners who provide lead referrals and complementary products and services, we believe this channel supports revenue opportunities without incurring the costs associated with traditional direct sales.
 Customer Support
     Our Professional Services group provides deployment support and ongoing business consulting to enterprise and mid-market customers and maintains involvement throughout the engagement lifecycle. All LivePerson customers have access to 24/7 help desk services through messaging, chat, and technical support ticketing.
 Marketing
     Our marketing efforts in support of our business operations are organized around the needs, trends and characteristics of our existing and prospective customer base. Our deep relationship with existing customers fosters continuous feedback and critical data analysis, thereby allowing us to develop and refine marketing programs that drive adoption across multiple customer segments. We have a global team, spread across key geographies that is focused on marketing our brand, products and services to executives responsible for the digital channel and consumer service operations of their organization.
Our main focus is on the automotive, financial services, retail, technology, telecommunications, and travel/hospitality industries. Our integrated marketing strategy is focused on driving demand, building customer and consumer advocacy, driving adoption of our LiveEngage platform, and supporting key areas of business, especially large enterprise, but also including mid-sized and small business, the channel and international entities. We aim to achieve this by delivering high-touch, small group events for senior executives, to educate them on messaging and the transformational ways that digital communication can help their business. We also market our software via high-level thought leadership campaigns, industry event participation, personalized lead generation campaigns to reach potential and existing customers using mediums such as paid and organic search, direct email and mail, industry- and category-specific tradeshows and events, and telemarketing.
 Our marketing strategy also encompasses a strategic communications approach that integrates public relations, social media, and analyst/influencer relations. We are focused on using those channels to communicate our brand value, to those key stakeholders, to increase overall brand and technology awareness. Communications seek to highlight key customer success stories, and promote executive thought leadership via contributed content, speaking opportunities and press interviews, to raise LivePerson’s profile and reinforce our position as an industry leader.
 Competition
The markets for mobile and online business messaging, and digital engagement technology are intensely competitive, rapidly changing and characterized by aggressive marketing, pricing pressure, evolving industry standards, rapid technology developments and frequent new product introductions. We believe that competition will continue to increase as our current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market, which may cause additional pricing pressure. If we are unable to accurately anticipate technology developments and continue to innovate in the markets in which we compete, or our competitors are more successful than us at developing compelling new products and services or at attracting and retaining customers, we may lose revenue and market share and our operating results could be adversely affected.
6

We have current and potential competition from providers of messaging and digital engagement solutions that enable companies to engage and connect with their consumer customers, as well as technology providers that offer customer relationship management and contact center solutions. We have current and potential competitors in many different industries, including:

• | technology or service providers offering or powering competing digital engagement, contact center, communications or customer relationship management solutions such as, eGain, Genesys, Nuance, Oracle, Salesforce.com and Twilio;


• | service providers that offer basic messaging products or services with limited functionality free of charge or at significantly reduced entry level prices;


• | social media, social listening, messaging, artificial intelligence, bots, e-commerce, and/or data and data analytics companies, such as Facebook, Google, and WeChat, which may leverage their existing or future capabilities and consumer relationships to offer competing B2B solutions;


• | customers that develop and manage their messaging solutions in-house; and


• | companies that provide cross-category and vertical-specific advice, such as About.com, UpWork and Yahoo Answers.


In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have substantial competitive advantages, such as greater brand recognition, significantly larger financial, marketing, and resource and development budgets, access to larger customer and/or consumer bases, larger and more established marketing and distribution relationships, and/or more diverse product and service offerings. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to any change in the general market acceptance of messaging services or any new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, pricing strategies or customer requirements. Also, because of these advantages, potential customers may select a competitor’s products and services, even if our services are more effective. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.
Technology
Three key technological features distinguish the LivePerson services:

• | We support our customers through a secure, scalable server infrastructure. In North America, our primary servers are hosted in a fully-secured, top-tier, third-party server center located in the Mid-Atlantic United States, and are supported by a top-tier backup server facility located in the Western United States. In Europe, our primary servers are hosted in a fully-secured, top-tier, third-party server center located in the United Kingdom and are supported by a top-tier backup server facility located in The Netherlands. In the Asia Pacific region, our primary and backup servers are hosted in fully-secured, top-tier, third-party server centers located in Australia. Nearly all of our larger customers outside of the United States are hosted within our UK- and Australia-based facilities. By managing our servers directly, we maintain greater flexibility and control over the production environment allowing us to be responsive to customer needs and to continue to provide a superior level of service. Utilizing advanced network infrastructure and protocols, our network, hardware and software are designed to accommodate our customers’ demand for secure, high-quality 24/7 service, including during peak times such as the holiday shopping season.


• | As a hosted service, we are able to add additional capacity and new features quickly and efficiently. This has enabled us to provide these benefits simultaneously to our entire customer base. In addition, it allows us to maintain a relatively short development and implementation cycle.


• | As a SaaS provider, we focus on the development of tightly integrated software design and network architecture. We dedicate significant resources to designing our software and network architecture based on the fundamental principles of security, reliability and scalability.


Software Design. Our software design is based on client-server architecture. As a SaaS provider, LiveEngage customers and visitors to our customers’ websites require only a standard Web browser and do not need to download software from LivePerson in order to interact with our customers’ operators or to use the LivePerson services. We also provide APIs that enable our customers and third-parties to integrate LiveEngage with custom designed applications.
 Network Architecture. The software underlying our services is integrated with scalable and reliable network architecture. Our network is scalable; we do not need to add new hardware or network capacity for each new LivePerson customer. This network architecture is hosted in co-location facilities with redundant network connections, servers and other infrastructure, enabling superior availability. Our backup server infrastructure housed at separate locations provides our primary hosting facilities with effective disaster recovery capability. We maintain the highest level of compliance with standards such as SOC2 and PCI. For increased security, through a multi-layered approach, we use advanced firewall architecture and industry-leading encryption standards and employ third-party experts to further validate our systems’ security. We also enable our customers to further encrypt their sensitive data using more advanced encryption algorithms.

Government Regulation
We and our customers are subject to a number of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, including laws related to conducting business on the Internet, such as laws regarding privacy, data protection, information security, cybersecurity, restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection or transfer of consumer data, content, consumer protection, internet (or net) neutrality, advertising, electronic contracts, taxation, provision of online payment services (including credit card processing), and intellectual property rights, which are continuously evolving and developing. Because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even if we don’t have a local entity, employees or infrastructure. Often, foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are more restrictive than those in the United States. The scope and interpretation of the laws and other obligations that apply to us, including those related to user privacy and data security, are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws and obligations outside the United States. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied differently in any given jurisdiction in a manner that is not consistent with our current practices, which could cause us to incur substantial cost and could negatively impact our brand, reputation and business.
U.S. and international privacy laws and regulations are evolving and changing, are subject to differing interpretations, may be costly to comply with, and may be inconsistent among countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. As we expand our operations in these countries, our liability exposure and the complexity and cost of compliance with data and privacy requirements will likely increase. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, applicable federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, or the privacy commitments contained in our contracts, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, customers, consumers, watchdog groups or others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.
Laws and practices regarding handling and use of personal and other information by companies have come under increased public scrutiny, and governmental entities, consumer agencies and consumer advocacy groups have called for increased regulation and changes in industry practices. For example, in December 2015, following the conclusion of the “trilogue” meetings between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission, an agreement was announced with respect to a new EU data protection framework, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which will become effective in May 2018 and will apply across the European Union. The GDPR will replace the current EU Data Protection Directive and will impose significantly greater compliance burdens on companies with users and/or operations in the European Union and provides for considerable fines up to the higher of 20 million Euros and 4% of global annual revenue for noncompliance. One material change is that data processors (as that term is defined by applicable EU data protection law) have direct obligations, including implementing technical and organizational measures, and enhanced notification rules. The GDPR also imposes certain technological requirements that may require us to make changes to our services to enable LivePerson and/or our customers to meet the new legal requirements and may impact how data protection is addressed in our customer and vendor agreements. The European Union has also released a proposed Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (e-Privacy Regulation) to replace the EU’s current Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (e-Privacy Directive) to, among other things, better align with the GDPR, to amend the current e-Privacy Directive’s rules on the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, and to harmonize across current EU member state e-privacy data protection laws. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations related to privacy may require significant cost, limit the use and adoption of our services, and require material changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in material fines and penalties or governmental orders requiring us to change our data practices, which could damage our reputation and harm our business.
Additionally, as Internet commerce continues to evolve, regulation by federal, state and foreign governments or agencies in the areas of data privacy and data security is likely to increase. For instance, the EU-US Safe Harbor program (“EU Safe Harbor”), which provided a valid legal basis for transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States, was invalidated on October 6, 2015, which has had a significant impact on the transfer of data from the European Union to U.S. companies, including us. In July 2016, the European Union and the United States agreed to a new framework called the EU-US Privacy Shield (“EU Privacy Shield”) that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the United States and that LivePerson certified to in September 2016. Similarly, a new Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield (“Swiss Privacy Shield”) was announced in January 2017 that replaces the former Swiss-U.S. Safe Harbor (“Swiss Safe Harbor”). The new EU Privacy Shield requirements could impact our business and result in substantial expense and require changes to our operations, and the EU Privacy Shield is subject to an annual review that could result in changes to our obligations. We may also have to require some of our vendors who process personal data to take on additional privacy and security obligations, and some may refuse, causing us to incur potential disruption and expense related to our business processes. If our policies and practices, or those of our vendors, are, or are perceived to be, insufficient or if our members and customers have concerns regarding the transfer of data from the European Union to the United States, we could be subject to enforcement actions or investigations by EU Data Protection Authorities or lawsuits by private parties, member engagement could decline and our business could be negatively impacted.

The EU Privacy Shield and other frameworks may be challenged by regulators and/or private parties and reviewed by the European courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers outside the EU. Ongoing legal reviews may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.
While there are other legally recognized mechanisms, such as standard Model Contractual Clauses, that we believe allow for the lawful transfer of EU personal data to the United States these mechanisms have also been subjected to regulatory or judicial scrutiny and may be invalidated or evolve to include new legal requirements that could have an impact on how we move data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, which could affect how we provide our services or adversely impact our financial results.
In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. If our privacy practices are deemed unacceptable by watchdog groups or privacy advocates, such groups may take measures that harm our business by, for example, disparaging our reputation and our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, privacy concerns may cause Internet users to avoid online sites that collect various forms of data or to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception of security and privacy concerns, whether or not valid, could inhibit sales and market acceptance of our products and services.
Businesses using our products and services may collect data from their website users. Various federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies impose laws regarding collection, use and retention of data from website visitors. We offer our customers a variety of data security procedures and practices, such as encryption for data at rest and masking algorithms for sensitive data prior to transfer to our database, in an effort to protect information. Changes to applicable laws and how they are interpreted relating to data security and other consumer protection areas could significantly increase the cost to us and our customers of regulatory compliance and could negatively impact our business.
For instance, some states in the United States have enacted legislation designed to protect consumer privacy by prohibiting the distribution of “spyware” over the Internet. Such legislation typically focuses on restricting the proliferation of software that, when installed on an end user’s computer, is used to intentionally and deceptively take control of the end user’s machine. We do not believe that the data monitoring methods that we employ constitute “spyware” or are prohibited by applicable laws. However, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, many of which can be enforced by government entities or private parties, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant changes in application and interpretation. If, for example, the scope of the previously mentioned “spyware” legislation were changed to include web analytics, such legislation could apply to the technology we use and potentially restrict our ability to conduct our business.
In addition, regulatory authorities and governments around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy, collection and use of website visitor data, data storage, data protection, the "right to be forgotten," content regulation, cybersecurity, government access to personal information, online advertising, email and other categories of electronic spam, and other matters that may be applicable to our business. Compliance with these laws may require substantial investment or may be technologically challenging for us. For example, some jurisdictions, including the United States, are considering whether the collection of anonymous data may invade the privacy of website visitors. If laws or regulations are enacted that limit data collection or use practices related to anonymous data, we and/or our customers may be required to obtain the express consent of web visitors in order for our technology to perform certain basic functions that are based on the collection and use of technical data. Requirements that a website must first obtain consent from its web visitors before using our technology could reduce the amount and value of the services we provide to customers, which might impede sales and/or cause some existing customers to discontinue using our services.
It is also likely that, as our business grows and evolves, an increasing portion of our business shifts to mobile, and our solutions are offered and used in a greater number of countries, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. We could need to expend considerable effort and resources to develop new product features and/or procedures to comply with any such legal requirements. It is difficult to predict how existing laws will apply to our business and what new laws and legal obligations we may become subject to. If we are not able to comply with these laws or other legal obligations, or if we become liable under them, we may be forced to implement material changes to our business practices, delay release of new and enhanced services and expend substantial resources, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any increased attention focused on liability issues, or as a result of regulatory fines or lawsuits, could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business and operating results.
The Company monitors pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments. Due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies

or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. A range of other proposed or existing laws and new interpretations of existing laws could have an impact on our business. For example:
Government agencies and regulators have reviewed, are reviewing and will continue to review, the personal data handling practices of companies doing business online, including privacy and security policies and practices. This review may result in new laws or the promulgation of new regulations or guidelines that may apply to our products and services. For example, the State of California and other states have passed laws relating to disclosure of companies’ practices with regard to Do-Not-Track signals from Internet browsers, the ability to delete information of minors, and new data breach notification requirements. California has also adopted privacy guidelines with respect to mobile applications. Outside the European Union and the United States, a number of countries have adopted or are considering privacy laws and regulations that may result in significant greater compliance burdens. Existing and proposed laws and regulations regarding cybersecurity and monitoring of online behavioral data, such as the proposed “Do Not Track” regulations, regulations aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices and collection and use of data from mobile devices, and other proposed online privacy legislation could potentially apply to some of our current or planned products and services. Existing and proposed laws and regulations related to email and other categories of electronic spam could impact the delivery of commercial email and other electronic communications by us or on behalf of customers using our services.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, in particular has aggressively investigated and brought enforcement actions against companies that fail to comply with their privacy or data security commitments to consumers, or fail to comply with regulations or statutes such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Any investigation or review of our practices may require us to make changes to our products and policies, which could harm our business. Currently there are many proposals by lawmakers and industry groups in this area, both in the United States and overseas, which address the collection, maintenance and use of personal information, web browsing and geolocation data, and establish data security and breach notification requirements. Further, regulators and industry groups have also released self-regulatory principles and guidelines for various data privacy and security practices. Given that this is an evolving and unsettled area of regulation, the imposition of any new significant restrictions or technological requirements could have a negative impact on our business.
We might unintentionally violate such laws now and in the future; such laws or their interpretation or application may be modified; and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could subject us to legal liability exposure, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
     We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other common law protections in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality requirements and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications in the United States and internationally and regularly file patent applications to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business, including intellectual property related to digital engagement technology and web and mobile based consumer-facing services. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products and services. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and trade names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We also own copyrights, including in our software, publications and other documents authored by us. These intellectual property rights are important to our business and marketing efforts. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, including registration, or otherwise in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. However, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new service developments, frequent enhancements and reliable maintenance are more essential to establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology. We enter into confidentiality and other written agreements (including invention assignment agreements) with our employees, consultants, customers, potential customers, strategic partners, and other third parties, and through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a service with the same functionality as our services. Policing unauthorized use of our services and intellectual property rights is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights, particularly in foreign countries where we do business, where our services are sold or used, where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States or where enforcement of laws protecting proprietary rights is not common or effective.
     Substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry. In the ordinary course of our business, our services and/or our customers' use of our services have been and may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as claims by non-practicing entities become more prevalent and as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of services in different industry segments overlaps. Some of our competitors in the market for digital engagement technology and/or web and mobile based consumer-facing services or other third parties may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology and have asserted or may assert claims against us. Any claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could require us to spend significant amounts in 
10

litigation (even if the claim is invalid), distract management from other tasks of operating our business, pay substantial damage awards, prevent us from selling our products, delay delivery of our services, develop non-infringing software, technology, business processes, systems or other intellectual property (none of which might be successful), or limit our ability to use the intellectual property that is the subject of any of these claims, unless we enter into license agreements with the third parties (which may be costly, unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, or not available at all). Therefore, any such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
The duration of the protection afforded to our intellectual property depends on the type of property in question, the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction and the terms of its license agreements with others. With respect to our trademarks and trade names, trademark laws and rights are generally territorial in scope and limited to those countries where a mark has been registered or protected. While trademark registrations may generally be maintained in effect for as long as the mark is in use in the respective jurisdictions, there may be occasions where a mark or title is not registrable or protectable or cannot be used in a particular country. In addition, a trademark registration may be cancelled or invalidated if challenged by others based on certain use requirements or other limited grounds. The duration of property rights in trademarks, service marks and tradenames in the United States, whether registered or not, is predicated on our continued use.
Employees
     As of December 31, 2017, we had 981 full-time employees. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
