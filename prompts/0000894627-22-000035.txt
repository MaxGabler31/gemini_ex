Item 1. Business
BACKGROUND
VAALCO Energy, Inc. is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1985 and headquartered at 9800 Richmond Avenue, Suite 700, Houston, Texas 77042. Our telephone number is (713) 623-0801 and our website address is www.vaalco.com. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. As used in this Annual Report, the terms, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “VAALCO” refer to VAALCO Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.
We are a Houston, Texas-based independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of crude oil. Our primary source of revenue has been from the Etame PSC related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon in West Africa. We also currently own an interest in an undeveloped block offshore Equatorial Guinea, West Africa. 
STRATEGY
We own crude oil producing properties and conduct operating activities offshore West Africa with a focus on maximizing the value of our Gabon resources and expanding into new development opportunities across Africa. Our financial results are heavily dependent upon the margins between prices received for our offshore Gabon crude oil production and the costs to find and produce such crude oil. On September 25, 2018, the term of the Etame PSC with Gabon related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon was extended through 2028 with two five-year options to extend the PSC (“PSC Extension”). The PSC Extension provides us with the extended time horizon necessary to pursue developing the resources we have identified at Etame. We also completed a dual listing of our common stock on the London Stock Exchange on September 26, 2019, which we believe will provide us access to additional sources of capital to help fund our growth objectives. 
In September 2019, we commenced our 2019/2020 drilling campaign. We drilled one development well and one appraisal wellbore in 2019, and during the first quarter of 2020, we drilled one development well and one appraisal wellbore. In addition, we successfully completed drilling the South East Etame 4H development well and brought the well onto production on March 21, 2020. 
In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of approximately 1,000 square kilometers of new dual-azimuth proprietary 3-D seismic data over the entire Etame Marin block, which will be used to optimize and de-risk future drilling locations and potentially identify new drilling locations. We expect the seismic data to enhance sub-surface imaging by merging legacy data with newly acquired seismic data, allowing for the first continuous 3-D seismic survey over the entire block. 
On February 25, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Sasol Gabon S.A.’s (“Sasol’s”) 27.8% working interest in the Etame Marin block offshore Gabon pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement dated November 17, 2020 (the “SPA”).
On October 11, 2021 we announced our entry into a consortium with BW Energy and Panoro Energy (the “BWE Consortium”) and that the BWE Consortium had been provisionally awarded two blocks, G12-13 and H12-13, in the 12th Offshore Licensing Round in Gabon. 


The award is subject to concluding the terms of the production sharing contracts with the Gabonese government. BW Energy will be the operator with a 37.5% working interest and we and Panoro Energy will have a 37.5% working interest and 25% working interest, respectively, as non-operating joint owners.
In December 2021, we commenced our 2021/2022 drilling campaign offshore Gabon with the Etame 8-H well. We expect to drill a minimum of four wells with options to drill additional wells. In February 2022 we completed the drilling of the Etame 8-H well and moved the drilling rig to the Avouma platform to drill the Avouma 3H-ST1 development well, which is targeting the Gamba reservoir. The initial flow rate of the ETAME 8-H well was 5,000 BOPD, 2,560 BOPD net to VAALCO’s 58.8% working interest in 2022. 
We are now focused on maximizing value, growing reserves and increasing production and will continue our efforts to repeat similar drilling campaigns in the future.
Our strategy is to create long-term value for all stakeholders by focusing on profitable growth from low-risk reserve development while maintaining financial discipline. Specifically, we seek to:
Focus on maintaining production and lowering costs to increase margins and preserve optionality to capitalize on an increase in crude oil prices;
Manage capital expenditures related to the Etame drilling program so that expenditures can be funded by cash on hand and cash from operations; 
Continue our focus on operating safely and complying with internationally accepted environmental operating standards;
Optimize production through careful management of wells and infrastructure;
Maximize our cash flow and income generation;
Continue planning for additional development at Etame as well as future activity in Equatorial Guinea;
Preserve a strong balance sheet by maintaining conservative leverage ratios and exhibiting financial discipline;
Opportunistically hedge against exposures to changes in crude oil prices; and 
Actively pursue strategic, value-accretive mergers and acquisitions of similar properties to diversify our portfolio of producing assets.
Strategy related to BWE Consortium
We believe that we have strong management and technical expertise specific to West Africa, and that our strengths include: 
Our reputation as a safe and efficient operator in Africa; 
Our history of establishing favorable operating relationships with host governments and local joint venture owners;
Our subsurface knowledge of key plays and risks in the broader regional framework of discoveries and fields;
Our operational capacity to take on new development projects;
Our familiarity with local practices and infrastructure; and
Our market intelligence to provide early insight into available opportunities.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
On February 25, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Sasol’s 27.8% working interest in the Etame Marin block offshore Gabon pursuant to the SPA (the “Sasol Acquisition”). Prior to the Sasol Acquisition, we owned and operated a 31.1% working interest in Etame. The Sasol Acquisition increased our working interest to 58.8%, almost doubling our total production and reserves. The effective date of the transaction was July 1, 2020. We completed the Sasol Acquisition for a final cash settlement payment of $29.6 million, which was paid from cash on hand and reflected the $44.0 million purchase price less (i) a cash deposit of approximately $4.3 million paid on the SPA execution date, (ii) net cash flows generated from the Sasol interest from July 1, 2020 through the closing date and (iii) other purchase price adjustments pursuant to the SPA. In addition, under the terms of the SPA, a contingent payment of $5.0 million was payable to Sasol should the average Dated Brent price over a consecutive 90-day period from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2022 exceed $60.00 per barrel. The conditions related to the contingent payment were met and on April 29, 2021, the Company paid the $5.0 million contingent amount to Sasol in accordance with the terms of the SPA. As a result of the acquisition, our net portion of production and costs relating to our Etame operations has increased from 31.1% to 58.8%. For further discussion on the Sasol Acquisition, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments.” 
The World Health Organization declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. The adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak materially decreased demand for crude oil based on the restrictions in place by governments trying to curb the outbreak and changes in consumer behavior. This led to a significant global oversupply of crude oil and consequently a substantial decrease in crude oil prices in 2020. 
In response to the oversupply of crude oil, global crude oil producers, including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producing nations (“OPEC+”), reached agreement in April 2020 to cut crude oil production. Further, in connection with the 


OPEC+ agreement, the Minister of Hydrocarbons in Gabon requested that the Company reduce its production. In response to such request from the Minister of Hydrocarbons, between July 2020 and April 2021, the Company temporarily reduced production from the Etame Marin block. Currently, the Company’s production is not impacted by OPEC+ curtailments. In July 2021, OPEC+ agreed to increase production beginning in August 2021 and to gradually phase out prior production cuts by September 2022. The decision to increase in production was reaffirmed by an OPEC+ meeting held on February 2, 2022.
We considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the substantial decline in crude oil prices on the assumptions and estimates used for preparation of the financial statements. As a result, we recognized a number of material charges during the three months ended March 31, 2020, including impairments to our capitalized costs for proved crude oil and natural gas properties and valuation allowances on its deferred tax assets. These are discussed further in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, crude oil prices have improved, there were no disruptions to operations as a result of COVID-19 or any strain thereof, global economic activity has steadily increased, and oil demand has stabilized over multiple quarters removing much of the uncertainty and instability in the industry. Therefore, no additional charges or impairments were required for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Crude oil prices have continually increased and are currently at the highest levels seen in recent years. The average annual Brent price per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $41.96 and increased 69% to $70.86 for the year ended December 31, 2021. At the end of 2021 and continuing into 2022, travel-related restrictions have lessened, access to vaccines that reduce the spread and impact of COVID-19 and its variants have become more accessible and the global economy appears more flexible to continuing to effectively operate in a COVID-19 environment. However, while the business environment in 2021 improved, the COVID-19 situation and effects thereof remain fluid. A prolonged outbreak may have a material adverse impact on our financial results and business operations, including the timing and ability of us to complete future drilling campaigns and other efforts required to advance the development of our crude oil and natural gas properties. For further discussion on the impact on operations of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current crude oil pricing environment see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments.”
We are currently a party to an FPSO charter for the storage of all of the crude oil that we produce. This contract will expire in September 2022. On August 31, 2021, we and our co-venturers at Etame approved the Bareboat Contract and Operating Agreement (collectively, the “FSO Agreements”) with World Carrier Offshore Services Corp. to replace the existing FPSO with a Floating Storage and Offloading unit (“FSO”). The FSO Agreements require a prepayment of $2 million gross ($1.2 million, net to VAALCO) in 2021 and $5 million gross ($3.2 million net) in 2022 of which $6 million will be recovered against future rentals. No other prepayments are required under the FSO Agreements until the vessel is accepted by the Company at the Etame Marin Block location, which is expected during the third quarter of 2022. The Bareboat Contract contains purchase provisions and termination provisions. We currently do not expect to utilize the termination provisions under the FSO Agreements. In addition, total field level capital conversion estimates, to accept and implement the FSO, are $40 to $50 million gross ($26 to $32 million net to VAALCO).
The BWE Consortium of VAALCO, BW Energy and Panoro Energy was provisionally awarded two blocks in the 12th Offshore Licensing Round in Gabon. The award is subject to concluding the terms of production sharing contracts (“PSCs”) with the Gabonese government. BW Energy will be the operator with a 37.5% working interest, with VAALCO (37.5% working interest) and Panoro Energy (25% working interest) as non-operating joint owners. The two blocks, G12-13 and H12-13, are adjacent to our Etame PSC as well as BW Energy and Panoro’s Dussafu PSC offshore Southern Gabon, and cover an area of 2,989 square kilometers and 1,929 square kilometers, respectively.
On November 3, 2021, we announced that our board of directors adopted a quarterly cash dividend policy of an expected $0.0325 per common share commencing in the first quarter of 2022. On January 28, 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0325 per share of common stock, which is payable on March 18, 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2022. Payment of future dividends, if any, and the establishment of future record and payment dates will be at the discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including current financial condition, the tax impact of repatriating cash, operating results and current and anticipated cash needs.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
For operating segment and geographic financial information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our only reportable operating segments are Gabon and Equatorial Guinea.
Gabon Segment
Offshore – Etame Marin Block
Our most significant asset, which accounts for 100% of our current revenues, is the Etame PSC related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon. The Etame Marin block covers an area of approximately 46,200 gross acres located 20 miles offshore in water depths of approximately 250 feet. Currently, our working interest in the Etame Marin block is 58.8%, and we are designated as the operator on behalf of the Etame Consortium. The block is subject to a 7.5% back-in carried interest by the government of Gabon, which they have assigned to a third party. Our working interest will decrease to 57.2% in June 2026 when the back-in carried interest increases to 10%.

Development
We commenced our 2019/2020 drilling campaign in September 2019 and completed the campaign in April 2020. In September 2019, we spud the Etame 9P appraisal wellbore at the Etame block offshore Gabon. In October 2019, the Etame 9P, targeting the subcropping Dentale reservoir, was successfully drilled to a total depth of 10,260 feet and encountered both Gamba and Dentale crude oil sands. In December 2019, VAALCO reached total depth of approximately 8,900 feet in drilling the Etame 9H development well and completed approximately 1,000 feet of the horizontal section within the Gamba reservoir as planned. The horizontal section of the Etame 9H development well is at the top of the Gamba structure where the high-quality reservoir is approximately 45 feet thick. After installing production equipment, the Etame 9H development well was brought online at an initial rate of 5,500 BOPD gross, (1,500 BOPD net to VAALCO’s 31.1% working interest in 2019). 
Shortly after completion of the Etame 9H development well, we began drilling the Etame 11H horizontal development well from the Etame platform, targeting the same Gamba reservoir at a different location in the Etame block. We reached a total measured depth of approximately 9,022 feet in the Etame 11H development well and completed approximately 860 feet of horizontal section within the Gamba reservoir. Similar to Etame 9H well, the horizontal section of the Etame 11H well is at the top of the Gamba structure but at a different location. After installing production equipment, the Etame 11H well was brought online at an initial flow rate of approximately 5,200 BOPD gross, (1,400 BOPD net to VAALCO’s 31.1% working interest in 2020) , in early January 2020. 
We drilled the SE Etame 4P appraisal wellbore to evaluate a Gamba step out area in the Etame block during the first quarter of 2020. With the drilling of the SE Etame 4P appraisal wellbore, we satisfied the drilling commitment as part of the PSC Extension that we signed in late 2018. The SE Etame 4P appraisal wellbore indicated the presence of approximately 1.0 to 2.0 MMBbls of hydrocarbons in the Gamba reservoir, and the Company began drilling a third development well, the SE Etame 4H as part of the 2019/2020 drilling campaign. This development well was brought online in late March of 2020. With respect to all of the wells drilled in the 2019/2020 drilling campaign, we did not encounter hydrogen sulfide (“H2S”) in either the Gamba or Dentale reservoirs, which could impact the safety and marketability of production from those wells. 
As discussed above, in December 2020, we completed the acquisition of approximately 1,000 square kilometers of new dual-azimuth proprietary 3-D seismic data over the entire Etame Marin block. We expect the seismic data to enhance sub-surface imaging by merging legacy data with newly acquired seismic allowing for the first continuous 3-D seismic over the entire block. The processing of the seismic data began in January 2021, and was completed by the fourth quarter of 2021. The seismic data will be used to optimize and de-risk future drilling locations and potentially identify new drilling locations. We commenced the 2021/2022 drilling campaign in December 2021 with the drilling of the Etame 8-H development well. We anticipate the costs of the 2021/2022 drilling program to have an estimated cost of $117.0 million to $143 million gross, or $74.0 million to 91.0 million, net to VAALCO’s 63.6% participating interest. In February 2022, we completed the drilling of the Etame 8-H well and moved the drilling rig to the Avouma platform to drill the Avouma 3H-ST1 development well, which is targeting the Gamba reservoir. The initial flow rate of the ETAME 8-H well was 5,000 BOPD, 2,560 BOPD net to VAALCO’s 58.8% working interest in 2022.
Production
Production operations in the Etame Marin block include eleven platform wells, plus three subsea wells tied back by pipelines to deliver crude oil and associated natural gas through a riser system to allow for delivery, processing, storage and ultimately offloading the crude oil from a leased FPSO vessel anchored to the seabed on the block. Production from seven of our wells is aided by electric submersible pumps (“ESPs”). We currently have fourteen producing wells. The FPSO can process up to approximately 25,000 BOPD and 30,000 Bbls of total fluids per day. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, aggregate production from the block was approximately 5.4 MMBbls (2.6 MMBbls net to us), 6.6 MMBbls (1.8 MMBbls net to us) and 4.7 MMBbls (1.3 MMBbls net to us), respectively. Our net share of barrels produced reflects an allocation of cost oil and profit oil after reduction for a royalty of approximately 13%. Periodically, we perform workovers on our wells to maintain or restore production. For further discussion on workovers see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments.”
Hydrogen Sulfide Impact
Four of our wells are currently shut-in for safety and marketability reasons because of high levels of H2S. These wells have been excluded from the above-referenced well count. H2S was not encountered in any of the wells or appraisal wellbores drilled in the 2019/2020 drilling campaign and thus far in the 2021/2022 drilling campaign. To re-establish and maximize production from the impacted areas, additional capital investment will be required, including the construction of one or more processing facilities capable of removing H2S, the recompletion of the temporarily abandoned wells and the potential drilling of additional wells. We have determined that these identified processing facilities are not the most economically attractive use of the Company’s resources at current crude oil prices. As of December 31, 2021, we had no proved reserves booked for the wells impacted by high levels of H2S.
Exploration
At December 31, 2021, we had $13.7 million in undeveloped leasehold costs related to the Etame Marin block. These costs are associated with the exploitation area expansion related to the PSC Extension and acquisition of Sasol’s interest in the Sasol Etame Marin block.

Abandonment Costs
Under the Etame PSC terms, the Etame Consortium has agreed to a cash funding arrangement for the eventual abandonment of all offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin block. We are required under the Etame PSC to conduct abandonment studies to update the amounts being funded for the eventual abandonment of the offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin block. The most recent abandonment study was completed in 2021 and resulted in estimated gross abandonment costs of approximately $81.3 million ($47.8 million, net to VAALCO) on an undiscounted basis. Through December 31, 2021, $37.1 million ($21.8 million, net to VAALCO) on an undiscounted basis has been funded. The annual abandonment cost requirements net to VAALCO’s 58.8% working interest, are expected to be $5.8 million in 2022 and, once the 2021 abandonment study has been approved by Ministry of Hydrocarbons in Gabon, a revised funding schedule will be established. Amounts paid are reimbursable through a “Cost Account” under the Etame PSC, which accumulates capital costs and operating expenses that are deductible against revenues, net of royalties, in determining taxable profits. These amounts are non-refundable. Our estimated liabilities for the abandonment of these Gabon offshore facilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $40.7 million and $17.3 million, respectively, which are included in the total “Asset retirement obligation” line item on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Initial recording of this liability is offset by a corresponding capitalization of asset retirement costs reflected under “Crude oil and natural gas properties and equipment – successful efforts method” in the line item “Wells, platforms and other production facilities” on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. 
Equatorial Guinea Segment
We acquired a 31% working interest in an undeveloped portion of a block (“Block P”) offshore Equatorial Guinea in 2012. The Equatorial Guinea Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons (“EG MMH”) approved our appointment as the operator of Block P on November 12, 2019. We acquired an additional working interest of 12% from Atlas Petroleum, thereby increasing our working interest to 43% in 2020, in exchange for a potential future payment of $3.1 million to Compania Nacional de Petroles de Guinea Equitoria, (“GEPetrol”) in the event that there is commercial production from Block P. On August 27, 2020, the amendment to the production sharing contract to ratify the Company’s increased working interest and appointment as operator was approved by the EG MMH. In April 2021 Crown Energy, who held a 5% working interest, elected to default on its obligations from Block P. On April 12, 2021, the majority of non-defaulting parties, as required by the Block P joint operating agreement, assigned the defaulting party’s interest to the non-defaulting parties. As a result, VAALCO’s working interest will increase to 45.9% once the EG MMH approves a new amendment to the production sharing contract. We have completed a feasibility study of a standalone development concept of the Venus discovery on Block P. We, working closely with the other joint venture owners, are now in the process of finalizing the plan of development before submitting it to the EG MMH for their approval.
 As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $10.0 million recorded for the book value of the undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the Block P license. 
We and our joint venture owners are evaluating the timing and budgeting for development and exploration activities under a development and production area in the block, including the approval of a development and production plan for the Venus Discovery. The Block P production sharing contract provides for a development and production period of 25 years from the date of approval of a development and production plan. 
OPEC+ Production Reductions
Near the end of 2019, OPEC had an agreement in place to reduce production by a total of 1.2 MBOPD until March 2020. In April 2020, countries within OPEC+ reached an agreement to cut crude oil production to reduce the gap between excess supply and demand, in an effort to stabilize the international oil market. Gabon undertook measures to comply with such OPEC+ production quota agreement and, as a result, the Minister of Hydrocarbons in Gabon requested that we reduce our production. In response to the request from the Minister of Hydrocarbons, in July 2020 through April 2021, we temporarily reduced production from the Etame Marin block. In July 2021, OPEC+ agreed to increase production beginning in August 2021 and to gradually phase out prior production cuts by September 2022. The decision to increase production was reaffirmed by an OPEC+ meeting held on February 2, 2022.
DRILLING ACTIVITY
As discussed above, we commenced the 2019/2020 drilling campaign in September 2019. The following table sets forth the total number of completed exploratory and development wells drilled in 2021, 2020 and 2019 on a gross and net basis:

RESERVE INFORMATION
Estimated Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenues
Reserve Data
In accordance with the current SEC guidelines, estimates of future net cash flow from our properties and the present value thereof are made using the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each of the twelve months of the year adjusted for quality, transportation fees and market differentials. Such prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations. For 2021, the average of such price used for our reserve estimates was $69.10 per Bbl for crude oil from Gabon. This compares to the average of such price used for 2020 of $42.46 per Bbl and $63.60 per Bbl for 2019.
Reserves reported below consist of net proved reserves related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon in West Africa. The Company currently has no other proved net crude oil or natural gas reserves. The table below sets forth our estimated net proved reserve quantities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 as prepared by our independent petroleum engineering firm, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”). The 2021 information includes the Sasol interest in the Etame Marin block as we acquired Sasol’s interest on February 25, 2021.

The information set forth in the foregoing tables includes revisions for certain reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in preceding years’ estimates. Such revisions are the result of additional information from subsequent completions and production history from the properties involved or the result of an increase or decrease in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in product prices, estimated operating costs and other factors. Crude oil amounts shown for Gabon are recoverable under the Etame PSC, and the reserves in place at the end of the contract remain the property of the Gabon government. The reserves at the end of the contract are not included in the table above.
We do not reflect proved reserves on discoveries in our reserve estimates until such time as a development plan has been prepared and approved by our joint venture owners and the government, where applicable. At December 31, 2019, the reserves associated with the Etame 9H were reclassified from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed producing reserves. The reserves associated with the South Tchibala 3H well were removed from proved undeveloped volumes because VAALCO and the Etame joint venture owners decided to remove the well from the 2019 development schedule and instead drill the Etame 11H. Drilling and completing the Etame 11H well resulted in reserve additions classified as proved developed nonproducing reserves at year end 2019. In 2020, we completed the Southeast Etame 4H development whose reserves is included in extensions and discoveries in the December 2020 balance. In February 2021, we completed the acquisition of Sasol’s interest in the Etame Marin block. The reserves associated with the acquisition is included in the purchase of reserves category of the December 2021 balance.
In comparing the net proved reserves of 11.2 MMBbls at December 31, 2021 to the 3.2 MMBbls at December 31, 2020, we added 2.6 MMBbls of reserves due to the acquisition of Sasol’s interest in the Etame Marin block and 8.0 MMBbls of reserves through positive revisions of previous estimates. 3.0 MMBbls of the positive revisions were due to price of and 5.0 MMBbls of positives revision through performance and PUDS. The increase of 63% in the average of the first-day-of-the-month prices for each of the twelve months of the year, adjusted for quality, transportation fees and market differentials required by SEC rules to determine reserves, was $69.10 for the 2021 year-end report from $42.46 for the 2020 year-end report. 
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. The quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered, production and operating costs, the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future crude oil and natural gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties.
Historically, we have reviewed on an annual basis all of our proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) to ensure an appropriate plan for development exists. At December 31, 2021, we had four PUD well locations included in our reserves which we expect to complete in 


2022. At December 31, 2020, we had no PUDs due to current SEC pricing. At December 31, 2019, we had no PUDs because future development wells had not been approved by joint venture owners. 
Controls over Reserve Estimates
Our policies and practices regarding internal controls over the recording of reserves are structured to objectively and accurately estimate our crude oil and natural gas reserves quantities and present values in compliance with SEC regulations and generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Compliance with these rules and regulations with respect to our reserves is the responsibility of a reservoir engineer, who is our principal engineer. Our principal engineer has over 30 years of experience in the crude oil and natural gas industry, including over 10 years as a reserve evaluator and trainer, and is a qualified reserves estimator, as defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ standards. Further professional qualifications include a Master’s degree in petroleum engineering and Texas Professional Engineering (PE) certification, extensive internal and external reserve training, and asset evaluation and management. In addition, the principal engineer is an active participant in industry reserve seminars, professional industry groups and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets periodically with management to discuss matters and policies related to reserves.
Our controls over reserve estimation include retaining NSAI as our independent petroleum and geological firm for all years presented. We provide information to NSAI about our crude oil and natural gas properties, which includes, but is not limited to, production profiles, ownership and production sharing rights, prices, costs and future drilling plans. NSAI prepares its own estimates of the reserves attributable to our properties. The reserves estimates shown herein have been independently evaluated by NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-2699. Within NSAI, the technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the NSAI reserves report incorporated herein are Mr. John R. Cliver and Mr. Zachary R. Long. Mr. Cliver, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 2009 and has over 5 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Rice University in 2004 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemical Engineering and from the University of Texas at Austin in 2008 with a Master of Business Administration Degree. Mr. Long, a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum geoscience at NSAI since 2007 and has over 2 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2003 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology and from Texas A&M University in 2005 with a Master of Science Degree in Geophysics.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS-ANGOLA
On September 30, 2016, we notified Sonangol P&P, our joint venture owners, that we were withdrawing from the joint operating agreement effective October 31, 2016. Further to our decision to withdraw from Angola, we closed our office in Angola and do not intend to conduct future activities in Angola. As a result of this strategic shift, the Angola segment has been classified as discontinued operations in the Financial Statements for all periods presented. In 2019, the Company and Sonangol E.P. entered into a settlement agreement finalizing the Company’s rights, liabilities and outstanding obligations for Block 5 in Angola. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Discontinued Operations - Angola.”

CUSTOMERS
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we sold our crude oil production from Gabon under a term contract with pricing based upon an average of Dated Brent in the month of lifting, adjusted for location and market factors. For the year ended December 31, 2018 through January 31, 2019, the contracted purchaser was Glencore Energy UK Ltd. (“Glencore”). Our contract with Mercuria Energy Trading SA covered crude oil sales from February 2019 through January 2020. Our contract with ExxonMobil Sales and Supply LLC (“ExxonMobil”), covered crude oil sales from February 2020 through January 2021 with pricing based upon an average of Dated Brent in the month of lifting, adjusted for location and market factors. In December 2020, the contract with ExxonMobil was amended to extend the date of the contract through the end of July 2021. In July 2021, the contract with ExxonMobil was amended to extend the date of the contract through the end of January 2022. In January 2022, the contract with ExxonMobil was amended to extend the date of the contract through the end of July 2022.
The terms of the Etame PSC include provisions for payments to the government of Gabon for: royalties based on 13% of production at the published price and a shared portion of “Profit Oil” determined based on daily production rates, as well as a gross carried working interest of 7.5% (increasing to 10% beginning June 20, 2026) for all costs. Prior to February 1, 2018, the government of Gabon did not take any of its share of Profit Oil in-kind. Beginning February 1, 2018, the government of Gabon elected to, and has continued to, take its Profit Oil in-kind.
EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
We operate on the fundamental philosophy that people are our most valuable asset as every person who works for us has the potential to impact our success. Identifying quality talent is at the core of everything we do and our success is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified employees. Our core values include honesty/integrity, treating people fairly, high performance, efficient and effective processes, open communication and being respected in our local communities. These values establish the foundation on which the culture is built and represent the key expectations we have of our employees. We believe our culture and commitment to our employees creates an environment that allows us to attract and retain our qualified talent, while simultaneously providing significant value to the Company and its stockholders by helping our employees attain their highest level of creativity and efficiency.
Demographics 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 117 full-time employees, 80 of whom were located in Gabon. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, although some of the national employees in Gabon are members of the NEOP (National Organization of Petroleum Workers) union. We believe relations with our employees are satisfactory.
Diversity and Inclusion 
We value building diverse teams, embracing different perspectives and fostering an inclusive, empowering work environment for our employees. We have a long-standing commitment to equal employment opportunity as evidenced by the Company’s Equal Employment Opportunity policy. Approximately 5% of our management team are female employees and 93.8% of our Gabon workforce is Gabonese. 
Compensation and Benefits 
Critical to our success is identifying, recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing our existing and future employees. We strive to attract and retain the most talented employees in the industry by offering competitive compensation and benefits. Our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy is based on rewarding each employee’s individual contributions and striving to achieve equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonus, and merit increases, which vary across the business. In addition, as part of our long-term incentive plan for executives and certain employees, we provide share-based compensation to foster our pay-for-performance culture and to attract, retain and motivate our key leaders. 
As the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people, we offer benefits that support their physical, financial and emotional well-being. We provide our employees with access to flexible and convenient medical programs intended to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In addition to standard medical coverage, we offer eligible employees dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, employee assistance programs, employee loans, voluntary short-term and long-term disability insurance and term life insurance. Additionally, we offer a 401(k) Savings Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan to certain employees. Certain employees receive additional compensation for working in foreign jurisdictions. Our benefits vary by location and are designed to meet or exceed local laws and to be competitive in the marketplace. 
Commitment to Values and Ethics
Along with our core values, we act in accordance with our Code of Ethics, which sets forth expectations and guidance for employees to make appropriate decisions. Our Code of Ethics covers topics such as anti-corruption, discrimination, harassment, privacy, appropriate use of company assets, protecting confidential information, and reporting Code of Ethics violations. The Code of Ethics reflects our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and also provides direction for reporting complaints in the event of alleged violations of our policies (including through an anonymous hotline). Our executive officers and supervisors maintain “open door” policies and any form of retaliation is strictly prohibited. 


Professional Development, Safety and Training
We believe that key factors in employee retention are professional development, safety and training. We have training programs across all levels of the Company to meet the needs of various roles, specialized skill sets and departments across the Company. We provide compliance education as well as general workplace safety training to our employees and offer Occupational Safety and Health Administration training to key employees. We are committed to the security and confidentiality of our employees’ personal information and employs software tools and periodic employee training programs to promote security and information protection at all levels. We utilize certain employee turnover rates and productivity metrics in assessing our employee programs to ensure that they are structured to instill high levels of in-house employee tenure, low levels of voluntary turnover and the optimization of productivity and performance across our entire workforce. Additionally, we have a performance evaluation program which adopts a modern approach to valuing and strengthening individual performance through on-going interactive progress assessments related to established goals and objectives.
Communication and Engagement 
We strongly believe that our success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to the Company’s overall strategy. To this end, we communicate with our workforce through a variety of channels and encourage open and direct communication, including: (i) quarterly company-wide CEO updates; (ii) regular company-wide calls with management and (iii) frequent corporate email communications.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, related government legislation and guidelines and orders issued by key authorities, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate. These changes included quarantining and testing of employees and persons before going to our offshore platforms, having the majority of our employees work from home for several months, and implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. We continue to maintain a high level of safety protocols and embrace a flexible working arrangement for our employees in Houston.
COMPETITION
The crude oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. Competition is particularly intense from other independent operators and from major crude oil and natural gas companies with respect to acquisitions and development of desirable crude oil and natural gas properties and licenses, and contracting for drilling equipment. There is also competition for the hiring of experienced personnel. In addition, the drilling, producing, processing and marketing of crude oil and natural gas is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, which may delay drilling, increase prices and have other adverse effects, which cannot be accurately predicted.
Our competition for acquisitions, exploration, development and production includes the major crude oil and natural gas companies in addition to numerous independent crude oil companies, individual proprietors, investors and others. We also compete against companies developing alternatives to petroleum-based products, including those that are developing renewable fuels. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staff that are substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable crude oil and natural gas assets, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and licenses than our financial or personnel resources will permit. Furthermore, these companies may also be better able to withstand the financial pressures of lower commodity prices, unsuccessful wells, volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry-wide economic conditions. These companies may also be better able to absorb the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations, which may adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to generate reserves in the future will depend on our ability to select and acquire suitable producing properties and/or develop prospects for future drilling and exploration.
INSURANCE 
For protection against financial loss resulting from various operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/control of a well, comprehensive general liability, worker’s compensation and employer’s liability. We maintain insurance at levels we believe to be customary in the industry to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of certain prohibited substances into the environment. Such insurance might not cover the complete claim amount and would not cover fines or penalties for a violation of environmental law. We are not fully insured against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is unavailable or because premium costs are considered uneconomic. A material loss not fully covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
REGULATORY
General
Our operations and our ability to finance and fund our operations and growth are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate. In particular, crude oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by:
change in governments;



civil unrest;
price and currency controls;
limitations on crude oil and natural gas production;
tax, environmental, safety and other laws relating to the petroleum industry;
changes in laws relating to the petroleum industry;
changes in administrative regulations and the interpretation and application of administrative rules and regulations; and 
changes in contract interpretation and policies of contract adherence.
In any country in which we may do business, the crude oil and natural gas industry legislation and agency regulation are periodically changed, sometimes retroactively, for a variety of political, economic, environmental and other reasons. Numerous governmental departments and agencies issue rules and regulations binding on the crude oil and natural gas industry, some of which carry substantial penalties for the failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and our potential for economic loss.
Gabon
Our exploration and production activities offshore Gabon are subject to Gabonese regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws and regulations could change in ways that could substantially increase our costs or affect our operations. The following is a summary of certain applicable regulatory frameworks in Gabon. 
2014 Hydrocarbons Law - Up until 2014, the fiscal and regulatory framework governing the exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Gabon was notably unregulated. Successive model contracts issued by the State of Gabon acted as guidelines; all fiscal aspects of each contract were negotiable between the State of Gabon and exploratory parties, including work commitments and exploration costs for each PSC. 
In September 2014, Law No. 11/2014, of 28 August 2014, came into force in Gabon (“2014 Hydrocarbons Law”). The 2014 Hydrocarbons Law was not exhaustive; it sought to provide a framework of governing principles and rules, applicable to both the exploratory and extracting industry of hydrocarbons, as well as the downstream sector, to be complemented by implementing regulations. 
Under the Gabonese Civil Code (“Civil Code”), laws will not have retroactive effects unless they expressly or tacitly provide otherwise. The Civil Code further provides that former laws continue to govern the effects of existing contracts, save in case of express or tacit derogation by the legislator and that, in any event, the application of a new law to existing contracts cannot modify the effects already produced by existing contracts under a former law, except via express derogation by the legislator. 
The 2014 Hydrocarbons Law explicitly provided that establishment conventions, petroleum contracts, petroleum titles, mining concessions and exploitation permits concluded or granted by the State of Gabon prior to the date of its publication remained in force until their expiration date. 
However, the 2014 Hydrocarbons Law further provided that unless such arrangements became consistent with the requirements of the 2014 Hydrocarbons Law, establishment conventions, mining concessions and exploitation permits in effect could not be extended or renewed. Furthermore, the 2014 Hydrocarbons Law prohibited establishment conventions and mining concessions, and provided that the exploitation of new discoveries in areas covered by existing conventions and concessions would be required to be made in accordance with the 2014 Hydrocarbons Law. 
2019 Hydrocarbons Law - The 2014 Hydrocarbons Law was repealed in its entirety by Law No. 002/2019, of 16 July 2019, published on 22 July 2019 (“2019 Hydrocarbons Law”). As with the 2014 Hydrocarbons Law, the 2019 Hydrocarbons Law contains provisions applicable to both the upstream and downstream segments. However, despite the publication of the 2019 Hydrocarbons Law, there are various issues and matters yet to be fully enacted by implementing regulations. 
Under the transitory provision contained in the 2019 Hydrocarbons Law, existing PSCs and other petroleum contracts, permits and authorizations remain in full force and effect until their expiration. 
However, any renewal or extension of those instruments are subject to the provisions of the 2019 Hydrocarbons Law, and its implementing regulations. 
The 2019 Hydrocarbons Law also provides for obligations for immediate application, irrespective of the date of signature of existing PSCs or petroleum contracts and/or granting of petroleum permits and authorizations. These include (i) the requirement for foreign producers and explorers applying for an exclusive development and production authorization to conduct their operations in Gabon through a company incorporated in Gabon rather than through branches of entities incorporated in other jurisdictions; and (ii) the obligation for all companies undertaking hydrocarbon activities to domicile their site rehabilitation funds with the Bank of Central African States, which is the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (“CEMAC”) or a Gabonese bank or financial 


institution subject to the Central Africa Banking Commission, which supervises banks and financial institutions licensed to operate in CEMAC countries, within one year after the entry into force of the 2019 Hydrocarbons Law. 
PSCs entered into between independent contractors and the State of Gabon since the implementation of the 2019 Hydrocarbons Law must include a clause providing that participation by the State of Gabon cannot exceed a 10 percent participating interest in the operations, to be carried by the contractor. 
The 2019 Hydrocarbons Law also entitles the Gabon Oil Company to acquire a maximum 15 percent stake at market value in all PSCs as of the date of signature. 
In addition, the 2019 Hydrocarbons Law provides that the State of Gabon may acquire an equity stake of up to 10 percent, at market value, in an operator applying for or already holding an exclusive development and production authorization.
Equatorial Guinea
Our exploration and production activities in Equatorial Guinea are subject to the applicable regulations of the country. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws and regulations could change in ways that could substantially increase our costs or affect our operations. The following is a summary of certain applicable regulatory frameworks in Equatorial Guinea.
All hydrocarbons existing in Equatorial Guinea’s onshore territory, as well as in its sovereign and jurisdictional waters, are Equatorial Guinea property and part of the public domain. The monetization of such hydrocarbons is to be pursued exclusively by Equatorial Guinea under its constitution, which reserves the exploitation of mineral and hydrocarbons resources exclusively to Equatorial Guinea and the public sector. However, the constitution also provides that Equatorial Guinea can delegate to, grant a concession to or associate itself with private parties for purposes of exploration and production activities in the manner and cases set forth by law.
Private crude oil companies have been allowed to conduct petroleum operations in Equatorial Guinea through PSCs signed by the minister responsible for petroleum operations on behalf of Equatorial Guinea. PSCs are subject to ratification by the President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and become effective only on the date the contractor is notified of presidential ratification. The powers to sign and amend PSCs and supervise their performance belong to the ministry responsible for petroleum operations. In addition, the national oil company of Equatorial Guinea, GEPetrol, holds, manages and takes participations in petroleum activities on behalf of Equatorial Guinea.
In 2006, the Parliament of Equatorial Guinea passed a new hydrocarbons law (“2006 Hydrocarbons Law”), which superseded the previous 1981 Hydrocarbons Law, as amended in 2000, incorporating not only the regime applicable to the exploration, appraisal, development and production of hydrocarbons, but also rules on their transportation, distribution, storage, preservation, decommissioning, refining, marketing, sale and other disposal. The Hydrocarbons Law contains provisions on a number of aspects concerning exploration and production operations and contracts, such as national content obligations, unitization, transfers and abandonment. The 2006 Hydrocarbons Law grants the ministry appointed to be responsible for petroleum operations (“Appointed EG Petroleum Ministry”) significantly broad regulatory, inspective and auditing powers concerning the performance of petroleum operations. These include the powers to negotiate, sign, amend and perform all contracts entered into between the State of Equatorial Guinea and independent contractors, as well as the right to access all data and information required for the control of contractors and their activities, including free access to the locations and facilities where petroleum operations are conducted. 
In addition, the Appointed EG Petroleum Ministry can also order (i) the suspension of petroleum operations; (ii) the evacuation of persons from locations; (iii) the suspension of the use of any machine or equipment; and/or (iv) any other action it deems necessary or appropriate when the Appointed EG Petroleum Ministry determines that a given petroleum operation may cause injury to or death of persons, damage properties, or harm the environment, or whenever the national interest so requires. 
Until June 2016, the Appointed EG Petroleum Ministry was the Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy, whose organization and authority were granted under Decree No. 170/2005, of 15 August 2005. 
In June 2016, the President of Equatorial Guinea appointed the EG MMH and the Minister of Industry and Energy, effectively splitting the Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy into two ministries. However, no legislation on the organization and authority of each ministry has been enacted, and, in effect, the EG MMH has been exercising the powers contained within the Hydrocarbons Law to the Appointed EG Petroleum Ministry. 
All contracts signed with the State of Equatorial Guinea for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons have taken the form of PSCs. A model PSC, approved along with the Hydrocarbons Law, must be used as the basis for any negotiation between independent contractors and the State of Equatorial Guinea. Over time, however, revised copies of the model PSC, reflecting changes made during negotiations of certain PSCs, have been used for the negotiation of subsequent PSCs. 
The Hydrocarbons Law and Petroleum Regulations provide the Appointed EG Petroleum Ministry with the power to award contracts for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons, and decide whether the award is made by means of competitive international public tender or direct negotiation. These contracts, however, which are to be negotiated by the Appointed EG Petroleum Ministry, shall only become effective after they have been ratified by the President of Equatorial Guinea and on the date of delivery to the contractor of a written notice of the President’s ratification. In practice, however, this notification to operators has been provided by the Appointed EG Petroleum Ministry. 



GEPetrol, established in 2001, is the national oil company of Equatorial Guinea and Sociedad Nacional de Gas de Guinea Equatorial (“Sonagas”), established in 2005, is the national gas company of Equatorial Guinea. 
The Hydrocarbons Law provides that these national companies are exclusively owned by the State of Equatorial Guinea, and must be supervised by the Appointed EG Petroleum Ministry. 
Under the applicable laws, the State of Equatorial Guinea may elect to have, either directly or through a national company, a minimum interest of 20 percent in a PSC. 
The State of Equatorial Guinea’s interest (through GEPetrol or otherwise) may be, and typically is, carried. No costs are paid by the State of Equatorial Guinea or GEPetrol with respect to a carried interest. The Hydrocarbons Law provides that the State of Equatorial Guinea (through GEPetrol or otherwise) will only be required to contribute to any cost for petroleum operations that it has a carried interest in from the period where it notifies the contractor that it no longer wants its interest carried. In effect, however, the carry normally ends with the approval of the development and production of the asset subject to the PSC. 
The terms and effects of the carry of an interest of the State of Equatorial Guinea (through GEPetrol or otherwise) are not clearly established in the Hydrocarbons Law or the Petroleum Regulations; the contractor that carries the State of Equatorial Guinea’s interest is given the right to a percentage of the cost recovery oil pertaining to that interest, as agreed in each PSC. 

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
General
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or pollution control. The cost of compliance could be significant. While we are currently complying with and are in good standing with all environmental laws and regulations, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial and damage payment obligations, or the issuance of injunctive relief (including orders to cease operations). Environmental laws and regulations are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. We also are subject to various environmental permit requirements. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which could subject us to liability for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for conduct or conditions caused by prior operators or third parties. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the crude oil and natural gas industry in general, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Although no assurances can be made, we believe that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with existing laws, rules and regulations regulating the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to our existing assets and operations. We cannot predict, however, what effect future environmental regulation or legislation, enforcement policies, or claims for damages to property, employees, other persons, the environment or natural resources could have on us.
In addition, a number of governmental bodies have adopted, have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change and to the lobbying effects of various climate change non-governmental organizations. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us, our joint venture owners, and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. For example, in April 2016, 195 nations, including Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and the United States, signed and officially entered into an international climate change accord (the “Paris Agreement”). The Paris Agreement calls for signatory countries to set their own greenhouse gas emissions targets, make these emissions targets more stringent over time and be transparent about the greenhouse gas emissions reporting and the measures each country will use to achieve its greenhouse gas targets. A long-term goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature increase to well below two degrees Celsius from temperatures in the pre-industrial era. The Paris Agreement is effectively a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol treaty, an international treaty aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, to which various countries and regions are parties. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States’ intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, with such withdrawal becoming effective in November 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued written notification to the United Nations of the United States’ intention to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which took effect on February 19, 2021 and on April 22, 2021, President Biden announced a target for the US to achieve a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide GHG emissions by 2030. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation, including the Paris Agreement and any related greenhouse gas emissions targets, potential prices on carbon emissions, regulations or other requirements, will affect our financial condition and operating performance. In addition, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation or impact the marketability of crude oil and natural gas. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels, and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production, and financial performance of our operations.



In part because they are developing countries, it is unclear how quickly and to what extent Gabon or Equatorial Guinea will increase their regulation of environmental issues in the future; any significant increase in the regulation or enforcement of environmental issues by Gabon or Equatorial Guinea could have a material effect on us. Developing countries, in certain instances, have patterned environmental laws after those in the U.S. However, the extent that any environmental laws are enforced in developing countries varies significantly.
With regards to our development operations offshore West Africa, we are a member of Oil Spill Response Limited (“OSRL”), a global emergency and crude oil spill-response organization headquartered in London. OSRL has aircraft and equipment available for dispersant application or equipment transport, including various boom systems that can be used for offshore and shoreline recovery operations. In addition, VAALCO has a Tier 1 spill kit in-country for immediate deployment if required. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion on the impact of these and other regulations relating to environmental protection.
