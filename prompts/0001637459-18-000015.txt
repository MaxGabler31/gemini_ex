Item 1. Business. 
General 
Kraft Heinz is one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world, with sales in approximately 190 countries and territories. We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, and other grocery products, throughout the world, under a host of iconic brands including Heinz, Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, Velveeta, Lunchables, Planters, Maxwell House, Capri Sun, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O. A globally recognized producer of delicious foods, we provide products for all occasions whether at home, in restaurants or on the go. As of December 30, 2017, we had assets of $120.2 billion. Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbol “KHC”.
On July 2, 2015 (the “2015 Merger Date”), through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”) (the “2015 Merger”). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company and H. J. Heinz Company changed its name to Kraft Heinz Foods Company. While we were organized as a Delaware corporation in 2013 (as Heinz), both Kraft and Heinz each had been pioneers in the food industry for over 100 years.
Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ("Berkshire Hathaway") and 3G Global Food Holdings, L.P. (“3G Capital”) (together, the "Sponsors"), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company (the “2013 Merger”).
See Note 1, Background and Basis of Presentation, and Note 2, Merger and Acquisition, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2015 Merger.
Reportable Segments
We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada, and Europe. Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World”. Rest of World is comprised of two operating segments: Latin America; and Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”).
In the third quarter of 2017, we announced our plans to reorganize certain of our international businesses to better align our global geographies. These plans include moving our Middle East and Africa businesses from the AMEA segment into the Europe segment, forming the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) segment. The remaining AMEA businesses will become the Asia Pacific (“APAC”) segment, which will remain in Rest of World. We expect these changes to become effective in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, we expect to restate our Europe and Rest of World segments to reflect these changes for historical periods presented in the first quarter of 2018.
See Note 19, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements for our geographic financial information by segment.
Net Sales by Product Category
In the first quarter of 2017, we reorganized the products within our product categories to reflect how we manage our business. We have reflected this change for all historical periods presented. The product categories that contributed 10% or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were:

 | December 30, 2017(52 weeks) | | December 31, 2016(52 weeks) | | January 3, 2016(53 weeks)
Condiments and sauces | 25 | % | | 24 | % | 32 | %
Cheese and dairy | 21 | % | | 21 | % | 15 | %
Ambient meals | 9 | % | | 9 | % | 10 | %
Frozen and chilled meals | 10 | % | | 10 | % | 12 | %
Meats and seafood | 10 | % | | 10 | % | 8 | %

We completed the 2015 Merger on July 2, 2015. As a result, 2016 was the first full year of combined Kraft and Heinz results, while 2015 included a full year of Heinz results and post-2015 Merger results of Kraft. The year-over-year fluctuations in the percentages between 2015 and 2016 are primarily driven by including Kraft’s results.

Sales and Customers
Our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers, agents and distributors to chain, wholesale, cooperative and independent grocery accounts, convenience stores, drug stores, value stores, bakeries, pharmacies, mass merchants, club stores, foodservice distributors and institutions, including hotels, restaurants, hospitals, health care facilities, and certain government agencies. Our products are also sold online through various e-commerce platforms and retailers. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately 21% of our net sales in 2017, approximately 22% of our net sales in 2016, and approximately 20% of our net sales in 2015.
Additionally, we have significant customers in different regions around the world; however, none of these customers individually are material to our consolidated business. In 2017, the five largest customers in our United States segment accounted for approximately 48% of United States segment net sales, the five largest customers in our Canada segment accounted for approximately 72% of Canada segment net sales, and the five largest customers in our Europe segment accounted for approximately 31% of our Europe segment net sales.
Raw Materials and Packaging
We manufacture (and contract for the manufacture of) our products from a wide variety of raw food materials. We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn products, wheat and other goods to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities. For commodities that we use across many of our product categories, such as corrugated paper and energy, we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale. In addition, some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations. We source these commodities from a variety of providers including large, international producers, and smaller, local, independent sellers. Where appropriate, we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and/or have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities. The prices of raw materials and agricultural materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors, such as global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather or global climate change, consumer, industrial or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, alternative energy, and agricultural programs.
Our procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices. Although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. We actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measures.
Competition
Our products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces, which have experienced increased concentration and the growing presence of e-commerce retailers, large-format retailers, and discounters. Competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies. We compete with both branded and generic products, in addition to retailer brands, wholesalers, and cooperatives. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality and innovation, brand recognition and loyalty, service, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, the introduction of new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs, distribution, shelf space, merchandising support, and price. Improving our market position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures.

Trademarks and Intellectual Property
Our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets. Depending on the country, trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. Significant trademarks by segment based on net sales in 2017 were:

 | Majority Owned and Licensed Trademarks 
United States | Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Philadelphia, Lunchables, Velveeta, Planters, Maxwell House, Capri Sun*, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O
Canada | Kraft, Heinz, Philadelphia, Cracker Barrel, P’Tit Cheese, Maxwell House, Tassimo*, Classico 
Europe | Heinz, Plasmon, Pudliszki, Honig, HP, Benedicta 
Rest of World | Heinz, ABC, Master, Quero, Golden Circle, Kraft, Wattie's, Glucon D, Complan 

*Used under license
We sell some products under brands we license from third parties, including Capri Sun packaged drink pouches for sale in the United States, TGI Fridays frozen snacks and appetizers in the United States and Canada, McCafe ground, whole bean, and on-demand single cup coffees in the United States and Canada, and Taco Bell Home Originals Mexican-style food products in U.S. grocery stores. In our agreements with Mondelēz International, Inc. (“Mondelēz International”), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions for certain periods of time following the spin-off of Kraft from Mondelēz International in 2012.
We own numerous patents worldwide. We consider our portfolio of patents, patent applications, patent licenses under patents owned by third parties, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations. Patents, issued or applied for, cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
Research and Development
Our research and development focuses on achieving the following four objectives:

• | growth through product improvements and renovation, innovation, and line extensions,


• | uncompromising product safety and quality,


• | superior customer satisfaction, and


• | cost reduction.

Research and development expense was approximately $93 million in 2017, $120 million in 2016, and $105 million in 2015.
Seasonality
Although crops constituting some of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis, most of our products are produced throughout the year.
Seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products, including holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. These factors influence our quarterly sales, operating income, and cash flows.
Employees
We had approximately 39,000 employees as of December 30, 2017.

Regulation
The manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated. Our business operations, including the production, transportation, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, quality and safety of our products and their ingredients, occupational safety and health practices, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our products are manufactured, distributed or sold. In the U.S., our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor, Department of Commerce and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside of North America, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, health and safety, anti-corruption, and data privacy. In our business dealings, we are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, and various other anti-corruption regulations in the regions in which we operate. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business.
Environmental Regulation
Our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight. Various laws concerning the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations.
In the United States, where a significant portion of our business operates, these laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party. We are involved in a number of active proceedings in the United States under CERCLA (and other similar state actions and legislation) related to our current operations and certain closed, inactive, or divested operations for which we retain liability. We do not currently expect these to have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition.
As of December 30, 2017, we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus, future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves.
