ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
History
 
Medicine Man Technologies, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada on March 20, 2014. On May 1, 2014, the Company entered into a non-exclusive Technology License Agreement with Futurevision, Inc., f/k/a Medicine Man Production Corp., dba Medicine Man Denver (“Medicine Man Denver”), pursuant to which Medicine Man Denver granted the Company a license to use all of the proprietary processes that it had developed, implemented and practiced at its cannabis facilities relating to the commercial growth, cultivation, marketing and distribution of medical and recreational marijuana pursuant to relevant state laws and the right to use and to license such information, including trade secrets, skills and experience (present and future) for 10 years.
 
In 2017, the Company acquired additional cultivation intellectual property through the acquisition of Success Nutrients™ and Pono Publications, including the rights to the book titled “Three A Light” and the proprietary cultivation techniques documented therein, which have been part of the Company’s product and service offerings since the acquisition. The Company acquired Two J’s LLC d/b/a The Big Tomato in 2018, which operates a retail location in Aurora, Colorado. It has been a leading supplier of hydroponics and indoor gardening supplies in the metro Denver area since May 2001.
 
On July 21, 2017, the Company issued 2,258,065 shares of its Common Stock for 100% ownership of Denver Consulting Group (“DCG”).
 
From June 5, 2019 through May 21, 2020, the Company completed a private placement of shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock for aggregate gross cash proceeds of approximately $18,575,000. In the private placement, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 9,287,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $2.00 per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,287,000 additional shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $3.50 per share.
 
The Company was focused on cannabis dispensary and cultivation consulting and providing equipment and nutrients to cannabis cultivators until its first plant touching acquisition in April of 2020. In 2019, due to the changes in Colorado law permitting non-Colorado resident and publicly traded investment into “plant-touching” cannabis companies, the Company made a strategic decision to move toward direct plant-touching operations. The Company developed a plan to roll up a number of direct plant-touching dispensaries, manufacturing facilities, and cannabis cultivations with a target to be one of the largest seed to sale cannabis businesses in Colorado. In April 2020, the Company acquired its first plant-touching business, Mesa Organics Ltd. d/b/a Purplebee’s (“Purplebee’s”), which consisted of four dispensaries and one manufacturing infused products facility.
 
On April 20, 2020, the Company rebranded and since then conducts its business under the trade name Schwazze. The corporate name of the Company continues to be Medicine Man Technologies, Inc. Effective April 21, 2020, the Company commenced trading under the OTC ticker symbol “SHWZ.”
 
On December 16, 2020, the Company issued and sold a Convertible Promissory Note and Security Agreement in the original principal amount of $5,000,000 to Dye Capital & Company, LLC (“Dye Capital”). On February 26, 2021, Dye Capital converted all outstanding amounts under the note into 5,060 shares of Preferred Stock.
 
On December 17, 2020, the Company acquired the assets of (i) Starbuds Pueblo LLC, and (ii) Starbuds Alameda LLC under separate Asset Purchase Agreements. On December 18, 2020, the Company acquired the assets of (i) Starbuds Commerce City LLC, (ii) Lucky Ticket LLC, (iii) Starbuds Niwot LLC, and (iv) LM MJC LLC under separate Asset Purchase Agreements. On February 4, 2021, the Company acquired the assets of (i) Colorado Health Consultants LLC, and (ii) Mountain View 44th LLC under separate Asset Purchase Agreements. On March 2, 2021, the Company acquired the assets of (i) Starbuds Aurora LLC, (ii) SB Arapahoe LLC, (iii) Citi-Med LLC, (iv) Starbuds Louisville LLC, and (v) KEW LLC under separate Asset Purchase Agreements. The Company refers to this series of acquisitions as the “Star Buds Acquisition.”
 
From December 2020 through March 2021 the Company completed a private placement of Preferred Stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $52.7 million dollars. In the private placement, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 52,700 shares of Preferred Stock at a price of $1,000 per share under securities purchase agreements with Dye Capital Cann Holdings II, LLC (“Dye Cann II”) and CRW Capital Cann Holdings, LLC (“CRW”) as well as subscription agreements with unaffiliated investors. Among other terms, each share of Preferred Stock (i) earns an annual dividend of 8% on the “preference amount,” which initially is equal to the $1,000 per-share purchase price and subject to increase, by having such dividends automatically accrete to, and increase, the outstanding preference amount, (ii) is entitled to a liquidation preference under certain circumstances, (iii) is convertible into shares of Common Stock by dividing the preference amount by $1.20 per share under certain circumstances, and (iv) is subject to a redemption right or obligation under certain circumstances.

On February 8, 2022, the Company acquired its New Mexico business under the terms of a Purchase Agreement, dated November 29, 2021, with Nuevo Holding, LLC and Nuevo Elemental Holding, LLC, both of which are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the “Nuevo Purchasers”), Reynold Greenleaf & Associates, LLC (“RGA”), Elemental Kitchen and Laboratories, LLC (“Elemental”), the equity holders of RGA and Elemental, and William N. Ford, in his capacity as Representative, as amended on February 8, 2022 (the “Nuevo Purchase Agreement”). The Nuevo Purchasers acquired substantially all of the operating assets of RGA and all of the equity of Elemental and assumed specified liabilities of RGA and Elemental. Pursuant to existing laws and regulations in New Mexico, the cannabis licenses for certain facilities managed by RGA are held by two not-for-profit entities: Medzen Services, Inc. (“Medzen”) and R. Greenleaf Organics, Inc. (“R. Greenleaf” and together with Medzen, the “NFPs”). At the closing, Nuevo Holding, LLC gained control over the NFPs by becoming the sole member of each of the NFPs and replacing the directors of the two NFPs with Justin Dye, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and one of its directors, Nancy Huber, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, and Dan Pabon, the Company’s General Counsel, Chief Government Affairs Officer and Corporate Secretary. The business acquired from RGA consists of serving as a branding, marketing and consulting company, licensing certain intellectual property related to the business of THC-based products to Elemental and the NFPs, providing consulting services to Elemental and the NFPs, and supporting Elemental and the NFPs to promote, support, and develop sales and distribution of products. Elemental is engaged in the business of creating and distributing cannabis-derived products to licensed cannabis producers. Elemental and the NFPs are in the business of cultivating, processing and dispensing marijuana in New Mexico, with 10 dispensaries, four cultivation facilities (three operating and one under development) and one manufacturing facility. The dispensaries are located in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Roswell, Las Cruces, Grants and Las Vegas, New Mexico. The cultivation and manufacturing facilities are located in Albuquerque, New Mexico and consists of approximately 70,000 square feet of cultivation and 6,000 square feet of manufacturing. On the same date, Nuevo Holding, LLC entered into two separate Call Option Agreements containing substantially identical terms with each of the NFPs. Each Call Option Agreement gives Nuevo Holding, LLC the right to acquire 100% of the equity or 100% of the assets of the applicable NFP for a purchase price of $100 if, in the future, the New Mexico legislature adopts legislation that permits a NFP to (i) convert to a for-profit corporation and maintain its cannabis license or (ii) sell its assets (including its cannabis license) to a for-profit corporation. The aggregate closing consideration for the acquisitions was approximately (i) $27.7 million in cash, and (ii) $17.0 million in the form of an unsecured promissory note issued by Nuevo Holding, LLC to RGA, the principal amount of which is payable on February 8, 2025 with interest payable monthly at an annual interest rate of 5%. The Nuevo Purchasers may be required to make a potential “earn-out” payment of up to $4.5 million in cash to RGA and William N. Ford (as Representative) based on the EBITDA of the acquired business for calendar year 2021.
 
On February 15, 2022, Double Brow acquired substantially all of the operating assets of Brow 2, LLC (“Brow”) related to its indoor cannabis cultivation operations located in Denver, Colorado (other than assets expressly excluded) and assumed certain liabilities for contracts acquired pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated August 20, 2021, among Double Brow, Brow, and Brian Welsh, as the owner of Brow (the “Brow Purchase Agreement”). The acquired assets included a 37,000 square foot building, the associated lease and equipment designed for indoor cultivation. After purchase price adjustments for pre-closing inventory, the aggregate consideration was $6.7 million, of which Double Brow paid $6.2 million at closing and held back $500,000 as collateral for potential claims for indemnification under the Purchase Agreement. Any of the purchase price held back and not used to satisfy indemnification claims will be released on February 15, 2023 plus 3% simple interest.
 
On March 11, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset and Personal Goodwill Purchase Agreement (the “Urban Dispensary Purchase Agreement”) with Double Brow, Urban Health & Wellness, Inc. d/b/a Urban Dispensary (“Urban Dispensary”), Productive Investments, LLC (“Productive Investments”), and Patrick Johnson (together with Productive Investments, the “Urban Equityholders”), pursuant to which the Purchaser will purchase (i) all of Urban Dispensary’s assets used or held for use in Urban Dispensary’s business of owning and operating a retail marijuana store and a grow facility, each located in Denver, Colorado, and (ii) all of Equityholders’ personal goodwill arising from Equityholders’ independent, separate, individual and personal efforts relating to Urban Dispensary’s business on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the “Urban Dispensary Purchase”), and assume obligations under contracts acquired as part of the Urban Dispensary Purchase. The aggregate consideration for the Urban Dispensary Purchase will be up to $1,317,500 million in cash and shares of Common Stock in an amount equal to $1,900,000 divided by the price per share of the Common Stock as of market close on the first trading day immediately before the closing. The Company will deposit $30,000 of the cash portion of the purchase price as an earnest money deposit with Urban Dispensary. At the closing, (i) the Company will use the cash portion of the purchase price to pay off certain indebtedness and transaction expenses of Urban Dispensary and then pay the balance to Urban Dispensary, and (ii) the Company will issue the stock portion of the purchase price directly to the Urban Equityholders. The stock consideration is subject to post-closing reduction if any of the actual marijuana product inventory, marijuana plant inventory or cash at closing is less than certain targets stated in the Purchase Agreement. The Company will hold back $288,000 of the stock consideration at closing as collateral for potential claims for indemnification from Urban Dispensary under the Urban Dispensary Purchase Agreement. Any portion of the held back cash consideration not used to satisfy indemnification claims will be released to Urban Dispensary on the 18-month anniversary of the closing date of the Urban Dispensary Purchase.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 
Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where we are currently directly involved, through our subsidiaries, in the cannabis industry. The Company is directly engaged in the manufacture, possession, sale, and distribution of cannabis in the adult-use cannabis marketplace in the State of Colorado.
 
The United States federal government regulates drugs in large part through the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. Marijuana, which is a form of cannabis, is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. As a Schedule I controlled substance, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse; no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. According to the U.S. federal government, cannabis having a concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, greater than 0.3% is marijuana. Cannabis with a THC content below 0.3% is classified as hemp.
 
The scheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance is inconsistent with what we believe to be widely accepted medical and recreational uses for marijuana by physicians, researchers, patients, and consumers. Moreover, as of March 21, 2022 and despite the clear conflict with U.S. federal law, at least 37 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use. Nineteen of those states and the District of Columbia have legalized the adult-use of cannabis for recreational purposes, although South Dakota’s adult-use measure is subject to potential challenge. In November 2020, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota voted by referendum to legalize marijuana for adult-use , and voters in Mississippi and South Dakota voted to legalize marijuana for medical use. South Dakota’s adult-use law was struck down by the South Dakota Supreme Court.
 
Unlike in Canada, which uniformly regulates the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of marijuana at the federal level under the Cannabis Act (Canada), marijuana is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. State laws regulating marijuana are in conflict with the CSA, which makes marijuana use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal. Although our activities are compliant with the applicable state and local laws in Colorado, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve us of liability under United States federal law nor provide a defense to any federal criminal action that may be brought against us. In 2013, as more and more states began to legalize medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal law and these state-legal regulatory frameworks.
 
Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal agencies and banking institutions through a series of Department of Justice memoranda. The most notable of this guidance came in the form of a memorandum issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013, which we refer to as the Cole Memorandum. The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal agencies on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states and quickly set a standard for marijuana-related businesses to comply with. The Cole Memorandum put forth eight prosecution priorities:
 
1. Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors;
 2. Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
 3. Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;
 4. Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
 5. Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
 6. Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
 7. Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and
 8. Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property.

-

 

On January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys, which we refer to as the Sessions Memo. Rather than establishing national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under state law, the Sessions Memo simply rescinded the Cole Memorandum and instructed that “[i]n deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the [DOJ’s] finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions.” Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles.”
 

Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys.
 
As an industry best practice, despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, we abide by the following standard operating policies and procedures, which are designed to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:
 
1. Continuously monitor our operations for compliance with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions;
 2. Ensure that our cannabis related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained;
 3. Implement policies and procedures to prevent the distribution of our cannabis products to minors;
 4. Implement policies and procedures in place to avoid the distribution of the proceeds from our operations to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels;
 5. Implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to reliably track inventory and prevent the diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law,
 or across any state lines in general;
 6. Monitor the operations at our facilities so that our state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs or engaging in any other illegal activity; and
 7. Implement quality controls so that our products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to avoid adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and discourage impaired driving.
 
In order to participate in either the medical or recreational sides of the marijuana industry in Colorado, New Mexico and elsewhere, all businesses and employees must obtain badges and licenses from the state or the Company and, for businesses, local jurisdictions. Colorado issues six types of business licenses including cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, transport, research license and testing. New Mexico also issues six types of business licenses but for production, manufacturing, retail, micro-production, consumption lounges and couriers. All applicants for licenses undergo a background investigation, including a criminal record check for all owners and employees.
 
Colorado and New Mexico have also enacted stringent regulations governing the facilities and operations of marijuana businesses. All facilities are required to be licensed by the state and local authorities and are subject to comprehensive security and surveillance requirements. In addition, each facility is subject to extensive regulations that govern its businesses practices, which includes mandatory seed-to-sale tracking and reporting, health and sanitary standards, packaging and labeling requirements and product testing for potency and contaminants.
 
Laws and regulations affecting the adult-use marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state, and federal adult-use marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.

We also employ several specialty contractors to provide support for various roles, including retail sales in our dispensaries, wholesale sale and distribution of our cannabis and non-cannabis products, manufacturing, cultivation, and general corporate.
 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
We use performance metrics to assess and reward employee performance, such as EBITDA targets, foot traffic, basket size and revenue per labor hour.
    COMPETITION
 
As the Company expanded its business and operations to include cannabis cultivation, manufacturing and retail activities, the universe of competitors also increased. We face substantial competition in each of our operating segments in the states in which we operate and throughout the United States. We currently operate in Colorado and New Mexico. As of March 4, 2022, there were 653 retail dispensaries and 420 licensed medical marijuana stores in Colorado. In New Mexico there are 508 licensed premises of which 228 are licensed retail locations.
 
The Company and its subsidiaries compete with a variety of different operators across the states in which they operate. In the majority of such states, there are specific license caps that create high barriers to entry. However, in some markets, such as Colorado, there are few caps on licenses creating a more open marketplace. Our most direct competitors within Colorado include a number of operators, such as The Green Solution ("TGS"), Native Roots, Green Dragon and LivWell. Our most direct competitors within New Mexico as of March 21, 2022, include Ultra Health, PurLife and Urban Wellness. The Company also views operators that have vertical operations outside of Colorado and New Mexico as potential strategic competitors due to our growth strategy, including Green Thumb Industries, Inc., iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc., Acreage Holdings, Inc., and Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. Like the Company, these companies can realize centralized synergies to produce higher margins. In addition to operators, we also have a number of manufacturing competitors, including Columbia Care Inc., Craft Concentrates, WHT LBL Cannabis, Colorado Cannabis Company, and Spherex Inc. When New Mexico legalizes adult-use cannabis on April 1, 2022, we anticipate additional competitors to come into the market.
 
Additionally, the Company competes with the unregulated black and grey markets. As the regulatory environment continues to develop, management believes there will be a major reduction of these unregulated participants.
 
TRADEMARKS - TRADENAMES
 
We rely upon our various trademarks, trade names and intellectual property, and we will, in the future and as appropriate, develop such intellectual property as we may determine valuable to our business. We also acknowledge that certain protections normally available to us related to design or other utility patents in the cannabis industry are not currently enforceable under federal law. We attempt to protect our intellectual property via the deployment of robust non-disclosure agreements with both prospects and licensees. There are no assurances that these non-disclosure agreements will prevent a third party from infringing upon our rights.
 

The Company utilizes a combination of copyright, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect its proprietary intellectual property. We intend to aggressively register for patent protection if and when the federal government eliminates the cannabis prohibition. Intellectual property counsel has advised that any effort to register a patent relating to the cultivation of marijuana would currently be unsuccessful. (See Item 3).
 
INDUSTRY ANALYSIS
 
Nationally, the marijuana industry has continued to expand through the passage of legislation in many states permitting medical and/or recreational use of cannabis under state law. While there certainly appears to be a trend towards acceptance of cannabis, there are no assurances offered that this business will be able to sustain itself over time if the Federal Government changes its current position related to state legalized operations.

As of March 21, 2022 at least 37 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use. Nineteen of those states and the District of Columbia have legalized the adult-use of cannabis for recreational purposes, although South Dakota’s adult-use measure has been struck down by the South Dakota Supreme Court. In November 2020, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota voted by referendum to legalize marijuana for adult-use, and voters in Mississippi and South Dakota voted to legalize marijuana for medical use.
 
While there have been many observations and prognostications relative to the recent elections, no specific laws have been passed by the federal government to change the federal prohibition of marijuana.
 
Colorado has continued to set new sales growth-related records, generating about $2.25 billion in gross sales in 2021; up from the $2.21 billion recorded in 2020 noting many of those sales were related to adult use and the robust tourist industry. It is noteworthy that 2021 grew over 2020 in Colorado despite cycling of high 2020 sales due to COVID-19. New Mexico has continued to grow as well, generating about $264 million of sales in 2021; up from the $201 million in 2020. The Company anticipates an increase in sales in 2022 compared to prior years in New Mexico when adult-use is legalized on April 1, 2022.
