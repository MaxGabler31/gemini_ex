Overview

Dais Corporation (“Dais”, “us,” “we,”, the “Company”) is a proprietary, nanotechnology polymer materials company. Nanotechnology involves studying and working with matter on an ultra-small scale. Doing this is how the Company built features and properties into its platform of nanomaterial sold under the brand name “Aqualtye™. Aqualyte™ is used to enable new product variants we believe are better than traditional products which use energy consuming and break-able components. Aqualyte™ itself, is marketed to OEMs to create differentiated products, while the second product is a fixed plate energy recovery ventilator called ConsERV, which we believe is useful in meeting building indoor fresh air requirements while saving energy and lowering emissions for most forms of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. We continue to develop other nano-structured polymer technology applications in HVAC/Refrigeration, energy, food services and wastewater treatment industries. 
Corporate History

We were incorporated as a New York corporation on April 8, 1993, as The Dais Corporation. The Company was formed to develop new, cost-effective polymer materials for various applications, including providing a lower cost membrane material for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane fuel cells. We believe our research on materials science has yielded technological advances in the field of selective ion transport polymer materials. In December 1999, the Company purchased the assets of Analytic Power Corporation, in March 2002, the Company sold substantially all its fuel cell assets to Chevron, a large U.S. oil company for a combination of cash and the assumption by such company of certain of the Company’s obligations and began working to commercialize the attributes and features of the nanomaterials developed since formation. In November of 2018, the board of directors unanimously voted to change the name of the Company from Dais Analytic Corporation to Dais Corporation (the “Name Change”). The Name Change took effect with FINRA on February 27, 2019.

On November 2, 2018, the shareholders of the Company approved an increase in the authorized common shares of the company from 240,000,000 shares to 340,000,000 shares. On March 14, 2019, the shareholders approved an increase in authorized common shares from 340,000,000 shares to 1,100,000,000 shares. In July 2019, the shareholders of the Company approved a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock at the ratio ranging from one-for-500 to one-for-2,000. On October 31, 2019, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to reflect a one-for-2,000 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock. The reverse split was effective December 6, 2019. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated in this annual report and the accompanying financial statements and footnotes to reflect the effects of the reverse split.

Our Technology

We use proprietary nanotechnology to reformulate thermoplastic polymers. Nanotechnology involves studying and working with matter on an ultra-small scale. Polymers are chain-like plastic molecules used in diverse products such as Dacron, Teflon, and polyurethane. A thermoplastic is a plastic (deformable) polymer material that melts to a liquid when heated and solidifies when cooled and is able to transition repeatedly between these states. Our reformulated polymers have properties that allow them to be used in unique ways, and we call the resulting material Aqualyte™.

The Company believes the attributes of its Aqualyte™ platform of nanomaterial create a catalyst for change:


· | Consume less energy and release less CO2 into the atmosphere 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Replace moving parts to increase operational lifetime 
· | Provide strong pathogen protection (COVID) and lower allergy/asthma triggers 
· | Reduce operating costs for increased ventilation rates shown in 3rd party testing to improve cognitive performance by 101% on average.
· | Extend the useable life of food and other organic materials 
· | Clean most forms of contaminated wastewater to levels up to one-hundred times greater than noted in the Clean Water Act of 1970. 

Our Products

The Company uses its knowledge of the Aqualyte nanomaterial to integrate it into traditional or new product form factors. It is management’s belief based on 3rd party industry or independent test results, the Company’s own testing, or data from customer use that the resulting product’s features and benefits address the growing market needs resulting from, but not limited to, the drivers of climate change as well as those needs created by the pandemic. 
Nanomaterial Platform - Aqualyte™ 

The Aqualyte Nanomaterial is made from commercially available polymer resin and industrial grade solvents which are mixed using a proprietary process with traditional industrial equipment. Our process creates a modified resin with key features and attributes that can be used to offer different properties to multiple products.

The Company sells Aqualyte to skilled OEMs using its features and properties to create new and/or improved products in a range of applications. The Company continues to develop next generation versions of its Aqualyte nanomaterial working to increase existing feature performance, add new features, and improving its cost. 

ConsERV™

We continue to expand sales channels to drive growth of revenues of our ConsERV product. ConsERV is an HVAC energy conservation product which should, according to various tests, save energy and operating costs on HVAC equipment, lower CO2 emissions and allow HVAC systems to be 20% - 67% smaller, reducing peak energy usage while simultaneously improving indoor air quality. This product makes most forms of HVAC systems operate more efficiently. ConsERV generally works in combination with existing HVAC systems, to provide improved ventilation air in a building. ConsERV uses a fixed-plate enthalpy exchanger (the “core”) constructed with our nanotechnology polymer. When compared to similar competitive products, we believe, based on tests conducted by the Air-conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), a leading industry association, ConsERV maintains an industry leading position in the management of latent heat. 

The Company began actively rolling out an updated ConsERV product line in 4Q, 2021. The updated line addresses market requested updates and features. 

The sales channels for ConsERV continue to expand across North America and include private labeling efforts. The Company has and continues to negotiate arrangements with independent sales/engineering representatives in multiple regions across North America who in turn target architect and specifying engineers, select OEMs, utility sponsored programs, and sophisticated users of HVAC equipment. 

We believe the growth initiatives and what we perceive as changes in the ERV market will allow the company to address well over fifty percent of the addressable North American market for ConsERV. 

We continue to have targeted discussions with identified companies in the European Union interested in buying and distributing both Aqualyte nanomaterial for use in their ERV cores as well as selling Dais produced ConsERV cores. To help us expand our capabilities in the reported high growth HVAC markets in Southeast Asia, Dais qualified a Chinese manufacturing company to produce ConsERV cores using Aqualyte membrane to meet the growing demand for ConsERV systems in the Region. 

The Company expects this trend of growing ConsERV system, core, and Aqualyte nanomaterial revenues to continue into 2022 and beyond.

Dais continues to respond to market interest by developing additional products that use our nanotechnology to save energy, provide clean water, protect health, and generally promote a more sustainable future.

Strategic Partnerships

In the quarter ending September 30, 2018, Dais entered into a strategic development and licensing agreement with the Haier Group, located in Qingdao, China. This innovative work is based around the Company’s Aqualyte nanomaterial potentially enhancing the performance of several Haier products. The efforts are set to run through the end of 2022 and have been heavily affected by the Pandemic. If Haier was to integrate the technology into their product(s) and associated sales channels, management feels such a move could have a significant revenue impact for Dais. We believe the potential revenue impact can be better assessed during the 1st quarter of 2023.

Patents may or may not be granted on any of the above applications. We also seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property, including intellectual property that may not be patented or patentable, in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our current and prospective strategic partners and employees.

Manufacturing

The Company currently uses a mix of in-house and outsourced assembles for its nanomaterial and product (ConsERV) needs. 

For future expansion and high-volume scale-up, the Company is actively looking at the costs and merits of organically scaling v. moving to a ‘near 100% outsourced’ model at the most optimum way to grow. Nonetheless, the Company continues to strengthen its existing supply chain with strategic partners having existing multiple channel access to the ERV or OEM Aqualyte markets – or with qualified outsourced firms.

The Company has continued to establish a robust supply chain with strategic partners having existing multiple channel access to markets – or with qualified outsourced firms. We do not have long-term contractual relationships with any of our manufacturers or vendors. There are no subassemblies or components that could not be purchased from alternative suppliers. Purchases to date of raw materials and related services have been on a purchase order basis using non-disclosure agreements.

OEM Customers, and Suppliers

Using the properties and features of its Aqualyte nanomaterial the Company has proven results in a variety of cross industry markets. We look to provide Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) with Aqualyte membrane. Then sharing how to use the options and features found in Aqualyte, to find the OEM able to offer better or even new products in consumer, commercial, and industrial having what we believe to be better lifetimes, and efficiencies. 

We are dependent on third parties to manufacture the key components needed for our nano-structured based materials and for the value-added products made with these materials. 

We require our suppliers to provide components in a timely manner, and to meet the Company’s quality, quantity and cost requirements or technical specifications with acceptable terms. Certain of the components or the processes of the Company’s suppliers are proprietary. If the Company were ever required to replace any of its suppliers, it should be able to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers at comparable costs, but this would create delays in production.

Research and Development

Expenditures for research, development and engineering of products are expensed as incurred. We incurred research and development costs of $223,425 and $221,700 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We account for proceeds received from government funding for research as a reduction in research and development costs. We recorded proceeds against research and development expenses on the Statements of Operations of $89,617 and $123,055 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Sales and Marketing Strategies

We have secured and continue to discuss relationships with leading industry HVAC manufacturers, HVAC product distributors, energy service companies, and ERV manufacturers outside of North and South America. In addition, we are discussing relationships for use of our ConsERV products in other applications outside of energy recovery ventilation world-wide.

The Company is focused on creating alliances with companies having strong, existing channel presence or expertise in the target industries, notably for ConsERV and Aqualyte OEM uses. We are using the data and experience of past sales in a variety of markets, adding newer features and functions, working to increase revenues. We intend to bring industry seasoned talent into the Company at the appropriate time to further drive market development, revenue growth and guide future product feature improvement needs.

Competition and Barriers to Entry

We believe the efficacy of our value-added products and technology can decrease sales of competing products, thus taking business away from more established firms using older technology. We believe that our ConsERV product may become a functional component of newer, more efficient OEM products. A key challenge is to educate decision makers of the benefits derived from products using our materials and processes, and to have qualified people and certified products which out-perform other products, diminishing the value proposition of competitive products in the various sales channels. As we continue to grow the base of operational and third-party data this education process will become routine.

There are several companies located in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia that have been developing and selling technologies and products in the energy recovery industry as listed below. We will experience significant competition regarding our products because certain competing companies possess greater financial and personal resources. Future product competitors include, but are not limited to:


Products | Current and Future Competitors 
---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ConsERV | Semco, Greenheck, Venmar, Bry-Air, Fuwei, Ltd, CORE Energy Recovery Solutions, Renewaire, Holtop, Hoval, Klingenberg, Solar Palau, Kraton, Daikin and AirXchange.


We believe the combination of our nano-material platform’s characteristics and growing patent position forms competitive advantages, which may allow us time to execute our business plan. Many of our competitors may experience barriers to entry in these markets primarily related to the lack of similarly performing proprietary materials and processes.

Government Regulation

We do not believe the sale, installation or use of our current nano-structured products will be subject to any government regulation, other than perhaps adherence to building codes and water safety regulations. We do not believe that the cost of complying with such codes and regulations, to the extent applicable to our products, will be prohibitive.

We do not know the extent to which any existing or new regulations may affect our ability to distribute, install and service any of our products. Once our other products reach the commercialization stage and we begin distributing them to our target markets, federal, state, or local governmental entities may seek to impose regulations.

We are also subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, and environmental regulations regarding handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. The process of manufacturing the solutions which are used to produce Aqualyte may expose us to the risk of harmful substances escaping into the environment, resulting in potential injury or loss of life, damage to property and natural resources. Depending on the nature of any claim, our current insurance policies may not adequately reimburse us for costs incurred in settling environmental damage claims and, in some instances, we may not be reimbursed at all. To date, we are not aware of any claims or liabilities under these existing laws and regulations that would materially affect the results of operations or financial condition. The completed products which use the Aqualyte material may have regulatory requirements relating to a variety of local or federal regulatory agencies, however, this type of exposure would be minimal. 

Employees

As of December 31, 2021, we employed 12 full-time employees and one independent contractor. None of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. As of the date of filing the number of employees of the Company has not changed. 
Principal Offices

Our principal office is located at 11552 Prosperous Drive, Odessa, FL 33556.
