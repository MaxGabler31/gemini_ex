Company Overview
 
   We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a growing pipeline of molecularly targeted immunotherapies designed to overcome the limitations of current immunotherapy and vaccine technologies. We own the proprietary T-cell activating platforms designed to train the immune system to better attack and destroy disease; Versamune®, for treatments in oncology and Infectimune™, for treatments in infectious disease. When paired with an antigen, which is a disease-related protein that is recognizable by the immune system, Versamune and Infectimune have both been shown to induce, in vivo, large quantities of high-quality, highly potent polyfunctional CD4+ helper and CD8+ killer T-cells, a specific sub-type of T-cell that is more effective at killing infected or target cells. Infectimune is also designed to promote the induction of disease-specific neutralizing antibodies. Our immuno-oncology product candidates are of potential interest for use as a component of combination product candidates (for example, in combination with other leading technologies such as checkpoint inhibitors) to provide more effective treatments across a range of advanced and/or refractory cancers. We are also evaluating our immunotherapies as monotherapies in early-stage disease for oncology.  We are developing targeted product candidates to treat several cancers including Human Papillomavirus (HPV) associated cancers, melanoma, colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancers. Our infectious disease candidates are of potential interest as vaccines to prevent COVID-19 and universal influenza.

    Our current pipeline of Versamune-based targeted immunotherapies and Infectimune-based therapies focuses on the use of selected disease-associated antigens that have been demonstrated to be associated with a variety of solid tumors, as well as specific infectious diseases. Our pipeline is shown below:

 Immunotherapy Overview
 
 Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the person’s own immune to fight disease by recognizing, attacking and eliminating cancer and also neutralizing infectious agents.  Immunotherapies, specifically for cancer treatment, come in a variety of forms including, but not limited to, killer T-cell stimulators, checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T-cell therapy and monoclonal antibodies.
 
 Cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite improvements in treatment. The Versamune platform belongs to a class of promising new treatments that have emerged from the convergence of the oncology and immunology fields. These novel therapies, that harness the power of the immune system to fight cancer, are called immunotherapies. Cancer immunotherapies have significant potential to treat a broad range of cancers, and several have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). While progress has been made in developing new anti-cancer immunotherapeutic technologies and products, significant challenges continue to limit their broad clinical effectiveness.  We are developing the Versamune based treatments with the goal of overcoming the limitations and safety concerns presented by other anti-cancer treatments.  PDS Biotechnology seeks to develop safe and effective therapies for cancer patients.

 
On a basic immunological level, there are considerable hurdles impeding the ability of immunotherapy to harness the body’s immune system. Although approved checkpoint inhibitors have been demonstrated to be effective in a small percentage of patients. However, for those patients who respond, the durability and duration of their responses can be significant. However, the reported rates of response for checkpoint inhibitors are only in the range of 15-20%. Importantly, immune therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-Ts and live-vector vaccines, present the potential for significant systemic toxicities limiting their use both in the treatment of early-stage cancer or in combination with other approved anti-cancer treatments. In contrast to the above described immunotherapies, we believe Versamune may have a unique combination of potency and safety therefore presenting a significant commercial opportunity in both early and late-stage disease.


 The challenges to effective immunotherapy
 
 The inability to generate adequate quantities of high-quality killer (CD8+) T-cells, to minimize systemic toxicities, to overcome the immune system’s tolerance of the cancer and to generate immunological memory, all limit the clinical effectiveness of immunotherapies.  On a fundamental biological or immunological level, one of the most significant challenges facing the industry is the development of simple and easy to administer therapies that can effectively treat cancer with minimal side effects.  Suboptimal activation of killer (CD8+) T-cells remains a key limitation of immunotherapies. Potential hurdles exist at various stages of the immunological process, including poor uptake of the antigen by the dendritic cells as well as inadequate processing and presentation of the tumor antigen into the correct immunological pathways.
 
Cancer Immunotherapy
 
 Cancer immunotherapy is a form of cancer treatment that utilizes the power of the body’s own immune system to recognize, attack and eliminate cancer. The ultimate goal of cancer immunotherapy is to improve patient quality of life and to extend patient life by slowing down the rate of spread of the cancer, shrinkage of the tumors and in some cases eradication of the cancer. The body’s immune system is a complex, biological network designed to defend against germs, other microscopic invaders, and cancer cells. Once the immune system recognizes an organism or cell as foreign or dangerous, it begins a series of complex reactions to identify, target and eliminate them. This process of events is referred to as mounting an immune response. Cancer immunotherapy takes advantage of the fact that most cancer cells express unique proteins, also called tumor antigens, not normally expressed by healthy cells that can be recognized by the immune system as abnormal. Because the immune system is precise, for the most part, a resulting immune response can target these dangerous cancer cells exclusively while sparing healthy cells. However, the challenge remains that cancer cells are able by various mechanisms to evade the immune system’s surveillance, so the body becomes tolerant to them.

     An ideal cancer immunotherapy should have the following attributes to maximize the opportunity for clinical effectiveness in patients. It should:
 

● | Stimulate both tumor-specific killer and helper T-cells within the body
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Activate, arm and expand large numbers of T-cells that recognize the tumor
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Alter or de-camouflage the tumor microenvironment (TME) to make the cancer more visible or susceptible to attack by the immune system
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Generate immune memory, so that if the cancer cells return, the immune system can recognize and eliminate them
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Optimize safety and tolerability by limiting systemic inflammation and toxicity
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Index
   As stated in the June 2019 issue of The Journal of Immunology, a leading peer-reviewed journal in the field of immunology, our Versamune platform possesses each of these attributes, inducing potent anti-tumor responses in preclinical studies. (Gandhapudi, et al., J. Immunology, June 2019; Rumfield et al, J. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer, May 2020). We believe our Versamune technology platform is unique in its ability to successfully encompass the mechanistic attributes required to induce a safe and effective anti-cancer immune response.

 
 How does cancer immunotherapy work?

 
 An important function of the body’s immune system is to scan for proteins not normally expressed in healthy tissue (antigens). Once an antigen has been identified as foreign, abnormal or dangerous, the antigen is presented to T-cells, a type of white blood cell effective at eliminating cancer cells and infectious agents (e.g. bacteria and viruses). The presentation of an antigen to T-cells is implemented primarily in the lymph nodes by specialized antigen presenting cells known as dendritic cells which are programmed specially to identify foreign antigens, process them and to present them to T-cells. Unique proteins on the surface of dendritic cells, known as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, bind to the foreign antigen and display them on the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate T-cells. Then, once presented, a sub-population of T-cells known as the CD8+ or killer T-cells, are primed and respond to the specific foreign antigen by attacking and killing the cells containing the abnormal protein. Other T-cell sub-populations, such as CD4+ or helper T-cells, are also critical in regulating immune responses.

      Cells communicate via chemical signaling. For an immune response to be triggered and to be effective, important immune signaling pathways must be activated to enable the body to induce messenger proteins known as cytokines and chemokines. Some of these cytokines and chemokines serve both to activate and expand T-cells and to arm the T-cells with the appropriate cancer-killing function.

      An effective cancer immunotherapy must modulate these complex processes, enhancing activation and producing robust expansion of the critically important high-quality, tumor-specific T-cell populations, most notably CD8+ killer cells. As will be reviewed in more detail in the section below, the ability to promote the induction of therapeutic quantities of high-quality tumor-targeting CD8+ killer T-cells within a patient’s own body has been a major limitation of cancer immunotherapy.

     Production of adequate numbers of high-quality CD8+ killer T-cells alone, however, is insufficient to eradicate all cancer cells. One of the difficulties in treating cancer, stems from the fact that cancer cells have the unique ability to evade the immune system; they camouflage themselves or suppress T-cell attack by activating immune mechanisms that suppress the ability of T-cells to detect or attack them. They accomplish this in part by increasing the population of immune suppressive cells, including cells known as regulatory T-cells (Treg) as well as other cell types, within the tumor microenvironment. An effective immunotherapy must overcome the tumor’s immune suppressive mechanisms in order to successfully locate and attack the cancer cells.
 
 Finally, cancers can be difficult to cure because they may recur even after successful initial treatment due to micro-metastatic (hidden) tumors that are not completely eradicated after treatment and that eventually expand.  It is yet another task of the immune system to remain vigilant over a sustained period to mitigate the risk of recurrence.  Such vigilance may be mediated by memory T-cells which serve as the immune system’s long-term memory. To be durable and effective over an extended period after treatment, and to minimize the likelihood of cancer recurrence, an immunotherapy should enhance this immune function as well.

 Versamune Products

 
 Versamune has shown the potential to overcome the challenges of immunotherapy

 
Versamune is a proprietary non-viral (synthetic) vector or T-cell activating platform designed to overcome the challenges of current immunotherapy and improve the treatment outcomes of patients with cancer. Versamune-derived products are based on positively charged (cationic) and immune activating lipids that form spherical nanoparticles in aqueous media. These lipids include the R-enantiomer of 1,2-dioleoyl-e-trimethyl-ammonium-propane (R-DOTAP). Cationic lipids are positively charged molecules that have a water-soluble portion (head group) attached to a water insoluble tail. The water-soluble portion of the molecule has a positive charge and the water-insoluble portion is made up of hydrocarbon (also called fatty acid) chains. The nanoparticles, which are coated with a positive charge, are deliberately sized to mimic viruses, facilitating detection by the body’s immune system and uptake by dendritic cells.
 
  
To treat a specific cancer, the unique or overexpressed antigen found on the surface of the cancer cells is manufactured, then mixed with the Versamune nanoparticles to create a pharmaceutical product for simple subcutaneous injection.

 Versamune has the potential to promote dendritic cell update of antigens


One of the biggest challenges in developing a potent immunotherapy has been dendritic cell uptake. Versamune is designed specifically to be taken up by dendritic cells in the skin. As noted, Versamune nanoparticles are sized comparably to viruses normally taken up as part of the natural function of the dendritic cells, facilitating efficient uptake of the Versamune-based immunotherapy. Studies evaluating the uptake of Versamune nanoparticles by dendritic cells and epithelial cells, found almost exclusive uptake by the dendritic cells. Four hours following a single subcutaneous injection, about 80% of the dendritic cells in the draining lymph node were found to have taken up the Versamune-based immunotherapy.
 Index
 Versamune has the potential to promote efficient antigen processing and T-cell presentation


When dendritic cells take up Versamune nanoparticles they become activated, mature and begin recruiting additional dendritic cells. Once inside the dendritic cell, the tumor-associated antigen is released and processed into the requisite small peptides (pieces of protein) in the cell compartment known as the cytoplasm. An important potential advantage of Versamune is its ability to fuse with and destabilize endosomes in the cell, promoting efficient entry of the antigen into the cell compartment where processing can take place. Processed antigen is turned into peptides that then present in both the MHC class I and class II pathways. The MHC class I pathway is critical to programming CD8+ killer T-cells and the MHC class II pathway to programming CD4+ helper T-cells to recognize tumor antigens. When Versamune-induced maturation occurs, the dendritic cells express costimulatory molecules on their surface, which facilitate the highly efficient uptake and presentation of antigens to the T-cells. We believe this activity overcomes one of the most significant limitations of current immunotherapy development – the efficient priming of critical CD8+ killer T-cells against tumor antigens. Interestingly, Versamune has been demonstrated to promote presentation of antigens to CD4+ helper cells as well.
 Index
 Versamune has the potential to promote efficient activation and robust expansion of high quality polyfunctional CD8+ killer T-cells in Lymph Nodes

 
 Ultimately mature dendritic cells migrate into lymph nodes, small glands located throughout the body containing white blood cells including T-cells, where much of the key immunological activity pertaining to the priming and expansion of T-cells takes place.  In the lymph nodes the dendritic cells present the tumor antigens to T-cells resulting in activation or priming of the T-cells to recognize the particular antigen expressed by the cancer. Importantly, Versamune has also demonstrated the potential to upregulate type I interferon genes (type I IFN), which are responsible for critical immunological processes. Upregulation of type I IFN induces an important immunological protein called CD69 that facilitates interactions between the dendritic cell and T-cells in the lymph nodes.

 
 Upregulation of type I IFN signaling also induces multiple immune messenger proteins called cytokines and chemokines that further signal T-cells to infiltrate into the lymph nodes. Powerful activators of CD8+ killer T-cells, such as CCL2 and CXCL10 are documented to be induced by Versamune as well. As the Versamune-induced production of chemokines appears to be restricted to the lymph nodes, the site of T-cell activation, it provides for both superior activation and expansion of CD8+ killer T-cells. Localization of these immune messengers within the lymph nodes and their limited presence in the blood circulation enhances the safety of the Versamune-based immunotherapies. Thus, through the versality of its mechanisms of action, as understood to date, we believe that Versamune may safely promote the efficient and robust expansion in-vivo of large numbers of highly potent (polyfunctional) CD8+ killer T-cells, both critical factors in developing a successful immunotherapy.
 

 Versamune  has the potential to overcome immune suppression

 
 Regulatory T-cells (Treg) are a sub-population of white blood cells normally responsible for recognizing normal healthy cells and for preventing autoimmune disease. In cancer however, they are utilized by the cancer cells to suppress immune detection. Versamune may contribute to significant alteration of the tumor microenvironment by dramatically reducing the Treg to killer CD8+ T-cell ratio thus making the tumors more susceptible to destruction by killer T-cells. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that lowering the Treg to CD8+ killer T-cell ratio with polyfunctional CD8+ killer and CD4+ helper T-cells promotes effective tumor lysis and regression.  Overcoming a tumor’s immune tolerance and minimizing its ability to evade detection is a significant goal of a successful cancer immunotherapy that together with potent T-cell induction may translate to enhanced tumor elimination.

 Results of Comparative Preclinical Testing of Versamune and Other Immunotherapies for the eradication of a Tumor
 
Using the tumor model, the Versamune based therapy was unique in its ability to reduce the tumor size and eventually completely regress the tumors. The results from the Versamune based treatment are attributed to its ability to induce: (i) powerful activation of the critical immunological signaling pathways, (ii) robust production of both CD8+ killer and CD4+ helper T-cells, and (iii) the degradation of the tumor’s protective immune suppression mechanism.

 Versamune has the potential to induce Immune Memory
 
 Memory T-cells allow the body to maintain tumor-recognizing and attacking T-cells for an extended period after treatment, with the ideal outcome of reducing cancer recurrence. Preliminary studies demonstrated that Versamune protected mice that had experienced tumor regression against tumor reestablishment even when the mice were reinjected with the same tumor cells. This sustained protection was evidence of immune memory: persistence of antigen-specific T-cells to recognize tumor proteins associated with a particular cancer, as the animals were not protected against establishment of different tumors. Evidence of the potential for Versamune-based immunotherapies to induce immune memory was also demonstrated in a phase 1 clinical trial in humans.
 
Enhancing tumor-specific memory responses to monitor for tumor antigens and eradicate cancer cells well after initial treatment we believe provides potential for significant durable clinical benefit by possibly reducing the incidence of tumor recurrence and improving survival of patients.
 

 Today, many cancer immunotherapies produce serious systemic autoimmune effects due to blockage of existing regulatory mechanisms such as the immune checkpoints as well as inflammatory toxicities due to the increased presence and spikes of cytokines in the blood circulation. We believe the mechanism of action of Versamune as well as its design have the potential to contribute to the localization of cytokines in the lymph nodes and specific targeting of CD8+ killer T-cells to antigens in tumor tissue. Therefore, the hypothesis is that Versamune-based therapies may exhibit an improved and favorable safety profile compared to currently available treatments.

 
 As noted, Versamune is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) and its mechanisms of action are localized primarily in the lymph nodes. Further supporting these observations are data demonstrating that negligible levels of Versamune-induced cytokines were detected in the blood of mice. Very low quantities of Versamune were detected in the blood or in any organ outside of the lymph nodes.

 
   Additionally, Versamune is broken down (hydrolyzed) in the body into fatty acids and excreted, showing in these preliminary studies that it could mitigate the potential for short- or long-term accumulation of the nanoparticles. These preclinical observations have been confirmed by early clinical data documenting that this localized and highly specific cascade of immune activity was associated with an absence of significant systemic toxicity at all doses tested. In a phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate safety, all patients had transient swelling and redness at the injection site due to initiation of the immunological cascade at the injection site which cleared completely within 3-7 days and no dose-limiting toxicities or long-term safety concerns were observed. Similarly, in our ongoing Phase 2 trials in combination with other treatments, no dose-limiting toxicities or long-term safety concerns were attributed to PDS0101 since three of the four studies were initiated in 2020.

 
 In choosing and designing a Versamune-based therapy for development, careful attention is paid to selecting specific, appropriate antigens because, as described above, Versamune induces a strong T-cell response to the antigen. All of the antigens currently being evaluated in combination with Versamune are present primarily in cancer cells which should therefore result in tumor-specific T-cell attack, thereby minimizing off-target toxicity and potential destruction of healthy cells and tissue.

 Versamune’ s potential as a cancer immunotherapy platform

 
The unique ability of Versamune to modulate and enhance numerous critical steps required for an effective immune response and to be combined with targeted specific antigens found on tumor cells, offers several exciting opportunities to treat a variety of cancers. Further, its diverse mechanisms of action together with its favorable safety profile suggest therapeutic promise when used in combination with other treatment modalities or immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors as well as in the single-agent monotherapy setting.
PDS0101: Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-Related Cancers
 
Despite the successful introduction of HPV preventive vaccines, HPV-related cancers remain a significant component of the global cancer burden. HPV infection occurs in both men and women and is associated with head and neck (oropharyngeal), cervical, anal, vaginal, vulvar and penile cancers.

 
 PDS0101 is our lead Versamune-based immunotherapy. PDS0101 combines Versamune with a mixture of short proteins (peptides) derived from the cancer-causing HPV16 viral protein. HPV16 is the most pervasive and difficult to treat HPV amongst the 13 different high-risk, cancer-causing HPV types. In a preclinical study in the most widely utilized animal HPV-cancer tumor model, PDS0101 uniquely induced complete regression of the tumors after a single sub-cutaneous injection. These data prompted a phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation, proof of concept study of PDS0101 in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) infected with high-risk HPV types. The data demonstrated that PDS0101 was immunologically active at all three doses studied, confirmed induction of high levels of active HPV-specific CD8+ killer T-cells, and was associated with clinical regression of the cervical lesions that often occurred rapidly. These results suggest that PDS0101 activated the critical mechanisms in humans resulting in potent T-cells which target and effectively kill human HPV-positive cancer cells. All patients who experienced regression remained disease-free over the 2-year retrospective evaluation period, suggesting potential durability or memory of the immune response. The clinical data were presented at the 34th Annual Society for the Immunotherapy of Cancer Conference in November 2019 (Wood, et al., 2019).  Based on these encouraging preclinical and human data, PDS0101 is being studied in multiple phase 2 clinical studies in various HPV-related cancers in collaboration with the NCI, Merck, MD Anderson Cancer Center and Mayo Clinic. We are currently conducting 4 phase 2 clinical studies for PDS0101.
 
PDS0102: T-cell receptor gamma Alternate Reading frame Protein (TARP)-Related Cancers

        The TARP antigen is strongly associated with prostate and breast cancers. In the U.S. 450,000 patients are projected to be diagnosed with prostate or breast cancer this year. Approximately 90% of prostate cancers and 50% of breast cancers overexpress the TARP tumor antigen. In a human clinical trial, the National Cancer Institute demonstrated that its proprietary TARP antigens were effectively recognized by the immune system in prostate cancer patients with PSA biochemical recurrence leading to a notable reduction in tumor growth rate. In preclinical studies, a dramatically enhanced TARP-specific killer T-cell response was observed when our designed TARP antigens were combined with Versamune. As discussed further below, in November 2021, we entered into the NCI Patent License Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by the National Cancer Institute, (“NCI”) of the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”).  We obtained a nonexclusive worldwide license to the patent rights for NCI’s T-cell receptor gamma alternate reading frame protein (“TARP”) to develop and commercialize TARP peptide-based therapies in combination with our Versamune technology for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia, prostate and breast cancers. Preclinical development is ongoing.

 
 PDS0103: Mucin-1 (MUC1)-Related Cancers

 
   MUC1 is highly expressed in multiple solid tumor types and has been shown to be associated with drug resistance and poor disease prognosis. We are developing PDS0103, a Versamune-based therapy in combination with novel, highly immunogenic, agonist epitopes of the MUC1 oncogenic C-terminal region to treat ovarian, breast, colorectal and lung cancers. In preclinical studies, similar to PDS0102, a dramatically enhanced MUC1-specific killer T-cell response was observed when the novel antigens were combined with Versamune. Preclinical development is ongoing.  

    Versamune has demonstrated immunological compatibility with a wide array of tumor and pathogenic antigens. While our current oncology pipeline pairs Versamune with 4 different tumor antigens, to address over 10 cancer types, more than 75 tumor antigens have been identified and reported. The versatility of the platform suggests that Versamune could work well with a wide range of identified tumor antigens and neoantigens. We are exploring the expansion of our Versamune-based pipeline by pairing the technology with multiple tumor antigens to develop additional product candidates.

 Infectimune’ s potential as an infectious disease vaccine platform
 
 PDS Biotechnology has developed a second cationic platform that is being applied to the development of infectious disease vaccines and this specific formulation has been trademarked Infectimune.  It has been formulated to activate the immune system to induce rapid and longer-lasting neutralizing antibody responses for improved protection against infectious pathogens.  It has the potential to induce T-cell responses including memory T-cell responses to provide the immune system with long-term memory and potential sustained protection against infectious pathogens over an extended period of time that may exceed traditional antibody-based protection. It could provide safe and effective vaccines that are well tolerated by healthy individuals.
PDS0201: Tuberculosis

 
PDS0201 combines the utility of the Versamune platform with bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) antigens. Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent and is caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is spread when people who are sick with TB expel bacteria into the air. About a quarter of the world’s population is infected with M. tuberculosis and thus at risk of developing TB disease.  It has been reported that a total of 1.5 million people died from TB in 2020. Worldwide, TB is one of the top 10 causes of death and the leading cause from a single infectious agent (above HIV/AIDS).  It is estimated that 10 million people fell ill with TB worldwide - 5.7 million men, 3.2 million women and 1.1 million children. There were cases in all countries and age groups. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a public health crisis and a health security threat. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there were 484,000 new cases with resistance to rifampicin – the most effective first-line drug, of which 78% had MDR-TB. WHO has identified TB as a global priority and is focused on eradication of the disease. The only licensed vaccine for prevention of TB disease was developed almost 100 years ago. PDS0201 is currently in preclinical development.
  
PDS0202: Universal influenza vaccine

 
According to the World Health Organization, influenza causes 3 to 5 million cases and approximately 290,000 to 650,000 deaths each year. Due to the existence of multiple strains of flu, a new seasonal flu vaccination is usually developed to provide protection against the strains predicted to be prevalent in an upcoming flu season. As a result, the protective efficacy of the current vaccines varies widely from season to season. We are developing a new generation of flu vaccines with the potential to provide long-lasting, and broad protection against multiple strains of the virus. We believe that the successful development of a universal flu vaccine could eliminate the need to create a vaccine to protect against each year’s predicted variants. Our Infectimune platform is combined with computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) to potentially provide longer lasting, more effective response to the influenza vaccine. The preclinical work is complete, and we are working to obtain nondilutive financing to fund the next steps in development. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we entered into the UGA Patent License Agreement with the University of Georgia which provides a nonexclusive license to the patent rights for the University of Georgia’s COBRA antigens to develop and commercialize a universal influenza vaccine worldwide. The UGA Patent License Agreement includes customary milestone payments and royalties. Preclinical work is ongoing.
  
PDS0203: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
 
 Our Infectimune platform based COVD-19 vaccine combines our nanoparticle technology with a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein derived from the spike (S) protein. Notably, the protein in this fully synthetic vaccine includes conserved and non-mutating regions of the virus. The vaccine has demonstrated strong potential in preclinical studies to efficiently promote the induction of killer (CD8+) and helper (CD4+) helper T-cells that recognize and induce immune responses against such non-mutating regions of the virus. The protein also includes regions of the spike protein that result in the induction of neutralizing antibodies. Development is being conducted in Brazil by our collaborator Farmacore, who is fully responsible for the development program, and clinical trials will be conducted in Brazil following all necessary regulatory approvals.  Farmacore is continuing to work on manufacturing and scale up process for the antigen component of the vaccine.

 Versamune Development Strategy
 
   The unique combination of high potency and excellent safety of the Versamune platform observed in preclinical studies was corroborated in the successfully-completed 12-patient PDS0101 Phase 1/2a clinical trial.  In September 2019, we reported retrospective clinical outcome data from this trial. Despite most of the patients being infected with multiple HPV strains including or excluding HPV 16, regression was seen in 8 out of 10 patients, with complete regression of pre-cancerous lesions documented in 6 out of 10 patients at their first post-treatment evaluation, which occurred within 1-3 months of completing treatment.  In addition, the fact that no disease recurrence occurred over the two-year evaluation period strongly suggested a robust and durable therapeutic immune response due to the induction of T-cells by PDS0101 administration that were clinically active. As a result of this information and the documentation in the trial of PDS0101’s ability to generate potent and biologically active CD8+ T-cells in-vivo, we focused our clinical strategy on areas of more severe unmet medical need in which PDS0101 is combined with other immune-modulating agents, including checkpoint inhibitors and standard of care e.g., chemoradiotherapy, to provide improved clinical benefit to patients.

 
 We believe that rational design of combination immunotherapies using complementary agents that promote synergy with each other and reduce the potential for compounded toxicity will substantially enhance the potential for combination therapies to deliver improved clinical benefit for cancer patients. Versamune appears to activate an appropriate combination of immunological pathways to promote strong CD8+ T-cell induction while also altering the tumor microenvironment to make tumors more susceptible to T-cell attack, which we believe makes it an ideal complement to checkpoint inhibitors and other immune-modulating agents by enhancing their potency as part of combination therapies. In addition, the differences in mechanism of action between Versamune and checkpoint inhibitors, as well as the initial demonstrated safety profile of Versamune, suggests that these combinations may be potentially much better tolerated by patients than other combination therapies involving checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments such as immune-cytokines and chemotherapy.
 
VERSATILE-002: PDS0101 + KEYTRUDA®

 
 In November 2020, our VERSATILE-002 Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of PDS0101 in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) which is the FDA-approved standard of care for first-line treatment of recurrent/ metastatic head and neck cancer opened and is actively recruiting patients.  The clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic combination as a first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer and high-risk human papillomavirus-16 (HPV16) infection.

 
   In this PDS Biotech-sponsored trial, patients whose cancer has returned or spread following initial treatment, will be able to avoid chemotherapy and take this combination of two immuno-therapy drugs. Enrolling patients with more functional immune systems that have not been compromised by extensive chemotherapy may allow improved efficacy of the combination.  Patients in the trial will receive a total of 5 cycles of combination therapy in the context of standard of care KEYTRUDA® therapy administered every three weeks until disease progression.  The primary endpoint of VERSATILE-002 is the objective response rate – or ORR – at six months following initiation of treatment.  There are two cohorts in the trial. Cohort 1 is for patients that are yet to be treated with a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI naïve) and cohort 2 which consists of patients that have failed checkpoint inhibitor therapy (CPI refractory).


 In the February 2022, we announced we had achieved the preliminary efficacy milestone of at least four or more objective responses of the first 17 patients in the CPI naïve arm which now allows that arm to proceed to full enrollment. We also announced detailed preliminary safety data which showed that the combination is likely safe and well tolerated without evidence of enhanced or significant toxicity in the first 18 patients in the CPI naïve arm. We continue to enroll patients in the first stage of the CPI refractory arm.

 National Cancer Institute: PDS0101+ M9241 +Bintrafusp Alfa

 
   In June 2020, the first patient was dosed under a PDS0101 Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), in NCI, led Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating PDS0101 with NHS-IL12 (M9241), and M7824 (Bintrafusp Alfa), both of which are owned by EMD Serono (Merck KGaA) in patients with advanced/refractory HPV-associated cancers who have failed prior treatment. In February 2021, we announced that the NCI’s Phase 2 clinical trial of PDS0101 for the treatment of advanced/refractory HPV-associated cancers achieved its preliminary objective response target in patients naïve to checkpoint inhibitors which allowed for full enrollment of approximately 20 patients in this group.  In addition, based on promising results in the CPI naïve arm, the trial was amended to allow enrollment of a separate cohort of checkpoint inhibitor-refractory patients for assessment of safety and activity of the triple combination. Preliminary efficacy assessment of the triple combination in this added group of 20 checkpoint inhibitor refractory patients is ongoing.  The NCI recently achieved the intended enrollment objective of 30 patients in the CPI refractory arm of the trial.  The trial has enrolled 45 patients and enrollment in the trial will continue until the total enrollment of 56 patients is achieved.


Preclinical study results arising from this CRADA were recently published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer, Immunomodulation to enhance the efficacy of an HPV therapeutic vaccine (Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer 2020;8:e000612. doi:10.1136/ jitc-2020-000612), indicating that PDS0101 generated both HPV-specific T-cells and an associated antitumor response when used as a monotherapy.  When PDS0101 was combined with two other novel clinical-stage anti-cancer agents, Bintrafusp Alfa and M9241, the preclinical data suggested that all three therapeutic agents worked synergistically to provide superior tumor T-cell responses and subsequent tumor regression when compared to any of the agents alone or the 2-component combinations.  If the published preclinical data demonstrating powerful activity of the triple combination is successfully confirmed in the ongoing Phase 2 trial, this triple combination could form the basis of a unique platform providing improved cancer treatments across multiple cancers.
  
In June 2021, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference the NCI announced interim data in this trial which included, data in both CPI naïve and refractory patients.  In the CPI naïve group 83% (5/6) of patients had an objective response, and 1 subject had achieved a complete response with no evidence of disease.  100% of the CPI naïve patients were alive at a median duration of 8 months.  In the CPI refractory group 42% (5/12) of patients had an objective response, and 1 subject had achieved a complete response with no evidence of disease.  10/12 (83%) of CPI refractory patients were alive at a median duration of 8 months.  An update provided in January 2022 showed as of December 31, 2021, that >40 subjects had been recruited into the trial and 30 HPV16-positive patients had been evaluated.  The median survival of all patients (3:1 CPI refractor to naïve) was 12 months and progressing.  The historical survival of CPI naïve and CPI refractory advanced HPV-associated cancers when treated with CPI are 7-11 months and 3-4 months respectively.
 
MD Anderson Cancer Center (IMMUNOCERV): PDS0101+ Chemoradiotherapy
 
  In October 2020, a third PDS0101 Phase 2 clinical study was initiated with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and is actively recruiting patients. This clinical trial is investigating the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of PDS0101 in combination with standard-of-care chemo-radiotherapy, or CRT, and their correlation with critical immunological biomarkers in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. PDS believes that Versamune’s strong T-cell induction has the potential to meaningfully enhance efficacy of the current standard of care CRT treatment in this indication. Enrollment rate in this trial had been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and enrollment is on-going.


 Mayo Clinic: PDS0101 Monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA®
 
 In February 2022 we announced the initiation of an Investigator-Initiated Trial (ITT), MC200710, for PDS0101 alone or in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor, KEYTRUDA®, in patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer (HPV(+)OPSCC) at high risk of recurrence.  The trial is being led by Drs. David Routman, Katharine Price, Kathryn Van Abel, and Ashish Chintakuntlawar of Mayo Clinic, a nationally and internationally recognized center of excellence for the treatment of head and neck cancers. We believe that this upcoming trial not only broadens our addressable patient population of those affected by the increasing incidence of HPV(+)OPSCC, but also allows us to better understand the activity of PDS0101 alone or in combination with KEYTRUDA® in earlier stages of disease.  This trial is currently open for enrollment.




 Index
 In this trial treatment will be administered before patients proceed to transoral robotic surgery (TORS) with curative intent. Treatment in this setting is referred to as neoadjuvant treatment. PDS0101 has been shown to induce killer T-cells that target and kill HPV-positive cancers, either alone or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in preclinical studies, and in combination in clinical studies of patients with advanced recurrent/metastatic HPV-associated cancers. This trial will explore whether PDS0101 with or without checkpoint inhibition may increase HPV-specific anti-tumor responses, potentially resulting in tumor shrinkage, pathologic regression, and decreases in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).


 Our clinical development strategy of combining PDS0101 with standard of care treatment is designed to mitigate risk in our proof-of-concept phase 2 trials.  It is also designed to demonstrate the potential for significantly enhanced clinical benefit to patients over the standard of care, without compounding toxicity. If we achieve this goal, we believe that we will have a clear path towards commercialization of PDS0101 in multiple indications.  After initial commercial approval, our strategy of combining PDS0101 with standard of care also positions us for rapid market penetration and expansion.

 PDS0102

 
 PDS0102 is an investigational immunotherapy utilizing tumor-associated and immunologically active T-cell receptor gamma alternate reading framed protein (TARP) from the NCI. PDS0102 is designed to treat TARP-associated cancers including, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), prostate and breast cancer. In our preclinical work, the administration of PDS0102, the Versamuine+TARP antigen combination led to the induction of large numbers of tumor targeted killer T-cells. In addition, the TARP tumor antigen alone has already been studied at the NCI in men with prostate cancer and been shown to be safe, immunogenic with slowing tumor growth rates (NCT00972309). We are evaluating the next steps in the clinical development of PDS0102 and are seeking nondilutive financings to move to human trials.
 
 PDS0103

 
 In April 2020, the above mentioned, PDS-NCI CRADA was expanded beyond PDS0101 to include clinical and preclinical development of PDS0103.  PDS0103 is an investigational immunotherapy owned by us and designed to treat cancers associated with the mucin-1, or MUC-1, oncogenic protein.  These include cancers such as ovarian, breast, colorectal and lung cancers. PDS0103 combines Versamune with novel highly immunogenic agonist epitopes of MUC-1 developed by the NCI and licensed by PDS. PDS0103 is currently in late preclinical development.

 
 MUC1 is highly expressed in several types of cancer and has been shown to be associated with drug resistance and poor disease prognosis in breast, colorectal, lung and ovarian cancers, for which PDS0103 is being developed.  Expression of MUC-1 is often associated with poor disease prognosis, due in part to drug resistance. In preclinical studies, and similarly to PDS0101, PDS0103 demonstrated the ability to generate powerful MUC1-specific CD8 killer T-cells.  In the first quarter of 2022, we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA on PDS0103. We were satisfied with the responses and believe we will submit our IND package in the third or fourth quarter of 2022 and will start human trials at the end of 2022.


 Infectimune Development Strategy

 
 We believe that the key differentiating attributes of the Infectimune platform technology, are strong induction of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells as well as antibodies, which can be leveraged to improve treatment and preventive options in several infectious disease indications.  Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity to highlight Infectimune’s potentially transformative utility in the development of more effective and longer lasting protective vaccines.  Our expanded infectious diseases pipeline now covers three infectious pathogens and vaccines.  Current preventive and prophylactic vaccine approaches and technologies predominantly focus on creating strong induction of antibody responses.  However, the induction of T-cell responses, in addition to antibody responses, provides more durable and broad protection against infectious diseases.

 PDS0203: COVID-19

 
Farmacore is developing PDS0203 under a licensing agreement with PDS Biotechnology. PDS0203 is a second-generation Infectimune-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate: a simple subunit vaccine that utilizes a recombinant protein derived from the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, as opposed to an inactivated virus-based vaccine.  Preclinical studies of PDS0203 have shown the induction of strong neutralizing antibodies, virus-specific polyfunctional CD8+ (killer) and CD4+ (helper) T-cells, and long-term memory T-cell responses.  Initial financial support for the program has been provided by the Brazilian government for preclinical development.


 On February 22, 2021, PDS Biotechnology and Farmacore announced that Blanver Farmoquímica e Farmacêutica S.A joined their efforts (collectively the “Consortium”) to develop and commercialize a novel COVID-19 vaccine in Latin America. Under the terms of the agreement, São Paulo-based Blanver will manufacture, promote, distribute, and commercialize the Infectimune-based COVID-19 vaccine in Latin America.

 
On March 11, 2021 we announced that the Consortium received a commitment from the Secretary for Research and Scientific Training of the MCTI, Brazil to fund up to approximately US$60 million to support the clinical development and commercialization of an Infectimune-based COVID-19.
 
 The progression of the Farmacore development program was delayed in the fourth quarter of 2021.  After a review of the program by PDS and Farmacore, the agreement with Farmacore was extended for six months to May 31, 2022 to provide additional time to Farmacore to commence manufacturing and scale up of drug product for use in clinical trials and any necessary process development work.  PDS will continue to monitor Farmacore’s progress with this program.


 PDS0203 is being designed with the goal to potentially provide long-term and broad protection against infection from COVID-19 and its potential mutations, based on the understood potential of Infectimune to prime the immune system to generate both antibodies for near term protection and T-cell responses for long term protection against pathogens. Preclinical data of studies performed at the University of Kentucky indicates that PDS0203 elicits the induction of highly active and potent virus-specific CD8 killer and CD4 helper T-cells within 14 days of treatment.  The study also showed induction of the long-lasting virus-specific memory T-cells necessary for longer term protection.  A 30-45-fold increase in COVID-19 specific T-cells was observed by Day 14 when compared to the vaccine without Versamune.  These preclinical studies also indicated induction of strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies within 14 days, with a 20-25-fold increase when compared to the vaccine without Versamune.

 
 The peer-reviewed scientific publication “A Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) Expressing a Membrane-Anchored Spike as a Cost-Effective Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine” by Sun et al. Vaccines (2020, volume 8, issue 4, page 771) also provides strong rationale for clinical development of an Infectimune-based COVID-19 vaccine to maximize the full breadth of immune responses induced against SARS-CoV-2.   This research conducted at the Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine, NY, indicated that there is powerful antibody induction by Versamune against SARS-CoV-2 at low antigen doses suggesting potential for an effective antigen dose sparing COVID-19 vaccine.  These data are based on preclinical studies combining our Infectimune technology with an inactivated Newcastle disease virus (NDV)/SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (NDV vaccine) developed at Mount Sinai.

 
The preclinical study compared various treatment regimens in their ability to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2:
 

● | the NDV vaccine alone at doses of 5µg, 10µg and 20µg,
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | the NDV vaccine in combination with Versamune at 0.2µg, 1µg and 5µg,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | and the NDV vaccine in combination with Addavax, an adjuvant well-known for its ability to induce powerful antibody responses, at 0.2µg, 1µg and 5µg.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Index
As seen in Figure 3B of the publication, shown below, the NDV vaccine with R-DOTAP nanoparticles (Infectimune) yielded the strongest antibody responses. Figure 3C, also shown below, highlighted Infectimune’s ability to induce the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies even at the lowest studied antigen dose of 0.2µg. Challenge studies also indicated that the Infectimune-containing vaccine conferred protection against challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
 


We understand this broader projected range of effective immunity to be a result of Infectimune’s activation of Type I interferons (IFNs) critical to developing effective anti-viral immune responses, and also to promote presentation of the unique disease-associated protein or peptide to the appropriate compartment of the dendritic cells of the immune system. As a result of this capability, Infectimune has indicated there is potential for enhanced immunogenicity in the context of dose sparing of both flu and COVID-19 antigens through strong induction of neutralizing antibodies.  Finally, in light of the chemical composition of PDS0203 as a subunit vaccine, we believe manufacturing scale-up for global deployment may encounter fewer challenges than is generally observed with more complex product candidates.
 
PDS0202; Universal Flu
 
 Based on the key characteristics of Infectimune we are progressing development of PDS0202, a universal influenza vaccine candidate, which combines Infectimune with novel Computationally Optimized Broadly Reactive (COBRA) influenza vaccine antigens designed by renowned influenza expert Dr. Ted Ross and licensed from the University of Georgia.  PDS0202 preclinical development was supported by an agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers, or CIVICs, program, with a goal of progressing into a human clinical trial. Preclinical development studies were performed at three sites: our Princeton, NJ laboratories, The University of Kentucky School of Medicine, and the CIVICs Center for Influenza Vaccine Research for High-Risk Populations.  The data produced in the preclinical showed significant levels of hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) titer levels when utilizing PDS0202 as compared to COBRA antigens alone ranging from 28x to 62x on various strains of the H1N1 influenza virus.
 Index
 The preclinical data also showed all animals in the control group when challenged by the flu virus became sick and died while all animals treated with either a 3mcg (high dose) or .012mcg (low dose) of PDS0102 remained alive and healthy.
 
 

 We are seeking nondilutive financing for the next stage of clinical development.

 
 PDS0201: Tuberculosis
 
 In December 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) with Farmacore to develop a novel tuberculosis, or TB, immunotherapy based on a combination of Farmacore’s proprietary TB antigens with Infectimune. In preliminary evaluations, our Infectimune-based TB product, PDS0201, demonstrated highly promising TB-specific T-cell induction in-vivo.  Under the Farmacore MTA, we will undertake product development and Farmacore will conduct in-vivo preclinical studies to evaluate product efficacy.  Testing is to be performed in Brazil although development was put on hold to prioritize PDS0203.  The term of the agreement extends until the end of the initial product testing period.  The research plan has been delayed due to COVID-19 research restrictions in Brazil.


Since our inception we have devoted substantially all our resources to developing our Versamune and Infectimune platforms and our Versamune and Infectimune -based products, advancing preclinical programs, conducting clinical trials, manufacturing PDS0101 for clinical trials, and providing general and administrative support. We have funded our operations primarily from the issuance of common stock. We have not generated any product revenue to date.  We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since our inception.
    Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:
 

● | the timing and costs of our planned clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | the timing and costs of our planned preclinical studies of our Versamune and Infectimune-based products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | the impact of COVID-19 on our operations;
--+------------------------------------------


● | the terms and timing of any future collaborations, licensing, consulting or other arrangements that we may enter into;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of any patents or patent applications or other intellectual property rights; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the extent to which we license or acquire other products and technologies.

Facilities & Manufacturing and Commercial scale up
 
Product candidates using our Versamune and Infectimune development platforms are manufactured using a readily scalable, fill-finish process with well-defined and reproducible operations. We do not own or operate cGMP compliant manufacturing facilities to produce any of our product candidates and we do not have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to produce the amounts of our product candidates necessary for our preclinical research and clinical studies. As part of the manufacture and design process for our product candidates, we rely on internal, scientific and manufacturing know-how and trade secrets and the know-how and trade secrets of third-party manufacturers. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing contractors.
 
Our research and development activities are located at the Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs, 303A College Road East, Princeton, NJ 08540, which provides first-rate development facilities for biotech companies. All animal toxicology and efficacy testing are done via third party contracts and collaborations to provide maximum flexibility and to minimize operational costs and overhead. This approach allows for independent validation of our data, and we believe it has historically been a cost-efficient way to progress our development programs.
 
We do not intend to incur the costs of building, staffing and maintaining manufacturing facilities in the near term. The supply chain integrity was not negatively impacted by COVID-19 thus far.  Our management team has formulation, manufacturing and operations expertise, including past senior executive management roles in contract drug development and manufacturing. Our management team plans to utilize its expertise and knowledge to identify suitable alternative contract manufacturers who will be capable of efficiently manufacturing our products.

Regulatory Pathway
 
For our lead product candidate, PDS0101, the next step in the product development process are our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials.  This process is described further under “U.S. Product Development Process.”  The final protocols for all phase 2 clinical trials were submitted to the FDA prior to trial initiation and information for all three trials are on www.clinicaltrials.gov.  To conform to the FDA electronic Common Technical Document format requirement and submission of the CGMP material that will be used in the Phase 2 trials for PDS0101, we submitted a Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls amendment to our Investigational New Drug application, related to PDS’s Phase 2 studies with PDS0101 to the FDA in 2020.
 
If Phase 2 clinical trials support further development, under standard FDA processes we would then need to complete a registrational Phase 2/3 clinical trial while continuing to gather other necessary application data and information for PDS0101 to seek marketing authorization.
 
We anticipate that we would seek marketing authorization from the FDA for our product candidates through the Biologics License Application pathway, under Section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act.  This process and the requirements are described further under “U.S. Product Development Process.”
 
 For our earlier stage, preclinical product candidates PDS0102 and PDS0103, we plan to work to develop data with the goal of progressing to an IND submission in 2022 or early 2023 and progressing clinical development to first-in-human trials with these products.  We have engaged with the FDA and received useful initial feedback on the clinical trial design for the PDS0103 program and this information will influence our strategy for regulatory submissions and the protocol development.


Intellectual Property
 
PATENTS
 
We seek to maintain high barriers to entry around our product candidates and the markets in which they are utilized by using a multiple layered approach to our patents, patent applications, and substantial know-how and trade secrets related to the Versamune
 platform.  We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to its business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights. We also rely on trade secrets relating to its platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain its proprietary position in the vaccine field. In addition, we rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. We also utilize trademark protection for our company name and we expect to do so for products and/or services as they are marketed.
 
PDS has developed numerous patents and patent applications and owns substantial know-how and trade secrets related to its Versamune
 platform. As of December 31, 2021, PDS holds six (6) U.S. patents with granted claims directed to its platform technology and sixteen (16) pending U.S. patent applications. These issued patents will expire in 2028, 2029, 2031 and 2033. Should the more recently submitted patent applications currently in prosecution be issued, these will expire in 2033 through 2037 assuming no patent term extensions are granted. As of March 1, 2022, PDS holds seventy (70) issued foreign patents and thirty-eight (38) pending or published foreign patent applications.  Most of our international issued patents are issued in multiple countries including Europe, Japan and Australia, and all of which cover compositions of matter and methods of use related to its platform technology. These issued patents will expire in 2031-2037, or later if patent term extension applies. Most recently, the USPTO allowed an application for our HPV 16 immunotherapy which when granted will run until October 2037.


Licensed Patents
 
We have an exclusive worldwide license from Merck & Cie to (R)-DOTAP and its crystal forms, manufacturing methods, and pharmaceutical compositions using the compounds., which are owned by Merck Patent GmbH, for use in our immunotherapy compositions and immunotherapies. Merck & Cie has informed us that it has rights to license these patent families through an intra-company agreement with Merck Patent GmbH.  These licensed patents are significant to Versamune and Infectimune platforms, as they are directed to the currently utilized Versamune ingredient.
 Index
We have licensed patented antigens from the US government for use worldwide in our cationic lipid immunotherapies. We have licensed T-cell receptor gamma alternate reading frame protein (“TARP”) from the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”)  to develop and commercialize TARP peptide-based therapies in combination with the Company’s Versamune technology and any other of the Company’s proprietary technologies for prostate and breast cancers and Acute Myeloid Leukemia.  These patents are directed to Immunogenic Peptides and Peptide Derivatives for The Treatment of Prostate and Breast Cancer Treatment and Multi-Epitope TARP Peptide Vaccine and Uses Thereof. These antigens are incorporated in PDS0102 with Versamune.  We have licensed mucin-1 (“MUC1”) novel highly immunogenic agonist epitopes of MUC1 developed by the National Cancer Institute. MUC1is highly expressed in multiple solid tumors and has been shown to be associated with drug resistance and poor disease prognosis in breast, colorectal, lung and ovarian cancers, for which PDS0103 is being developed.   We have been granted patents and are pursuing additional patents that cover compositions and methods of use of cationic lipid immunotherapies with each of the licensed technologies.
 
We entered into a non-exclusive agreement to license COBRA universal influenza antigens with the University of Georgia Research Foundation to develop, manufacture and use COBRA antigens in a clinical trial for a universal influenza vaccine worldwide.  These antigens are developed by Dr. Ted Ross at the University of Georgia.  We believe that the combination of these antigens with our proprietary Infectimune technology, representing PDS0202, has the potential to induce a broad immune response as a universal flu vaccine, based on preclinical development studies performed to date.
    Trade Secrets and Other Proprietary Information
 
In contrast to patent protection or regulatory exclusivities, trade secret protection is a form of intellectual property that does not require disclosure of the subject information as part of the process, but instead depends on maintaining the subject information as strictly confidential.  Companies may in some circumstances rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of their proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where they do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Trade secret protection depends in part on confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors that prohibit disclosure of designated proprietary information.  Trade secrets can be difficult to protect.  Confidentiality agreements may not succeed in preventing a person or parties from disclosing confidential information, and in that event the rights of the trade secret holder are subject to the viability of an adequate remedy at law, typically under state law modeled on the Uniform Trade Secrets Protection Act, to stop, mitigate or compensate for the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of the proprietary rights.  Finally, there is always at least some risk that others may independently discover the trade secrets and proprietary information.
Material License Agreements and Research and Development Agreements
 
Patent License Agreements with National Institutes of Health.
 
Effective January 5, 2015, we entered into a Patent License Agreement (the “Patent License Agreement”) as Amended by First Amendment to Patent License Agreement (“First Amendment”) of August 5, 2015, with an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), pursuant to which NIH granted PDS a nonexclusive license to certain patent rights for the development of a therapeutic cancer vaccine specifically in combination with PDS’s proprietary Versamune technology for ovarian, breast, colon and lung cancers. The Patent License Agreement expires when the last licensed patent expires if the Patent License Agreement is not terminated prior to that date. NIH may terminate the Patent License Agreement if PDS is in default in the performance of any material obligation under the Patent License Agreement. PDS may unilaterally terminate the Patent License Agreement in any country or territory upon sixty (60) days written notice.
 
 Under the Patent License Agreement and First Amendment PDS agreed to pay NIH: (a) a noncreditable, nonrefundable royalty in the amount of $30,000 upon execution of the Patent License Agreement; (b) a noncreditable, nonrefundable royalty in the amount of $60,000 upon execution of the First Amendment to Patent License Agreement (c) a nonrefundable minimum annual royalty of $5,000; (d) earned royalties of two percent (2%) on net sales, reducible by a half percent (0.5%) for any earned royalties PDS must pay to third parties; (e) benchmark royalties as follows: (i) $25,000 upon successful completion of each Phase 2 Clinical Studies of a licensed product for breast, colon, lung or ovarian cancer within each licensed territory; (ii) $50,000 upon initiation of the first Phase 3 Clinical Trial of a licensed product for breast, colon, lung or ovarian cancer within each licensed territory; (iii) $750,000 upon the first commercial sale in the licensed territory utilizing and/or directed to licensed product(s) and/or licensed process(es) within the licensed patent rights for breast, colon, lung or ovarian cancer; and (f) additional sublicensing royalties for each sublicense required to be approved by NIH of four percent (4%) on the fair market value of any consideration received for granting such sublicense.




 Index
 Effective as November 5, 2021, we entered into a Patent License Agreement (the “NCI Patent License Agreement”) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by NCI of NIH.  Pursuant to the NCI Patent License Agreement, the Company obtained a nonexclusive, worldwide license to the patent rights for TARP to develop and commercialize TARP peptide-based therapies in combination with the Versamune technology and any other of our proprietary technologies for prostate and breast cancers and Acute Myeloid Leukemia.  The NCI Patent License Agreement expires when the last licensed patent expires if the Patent License Agreement is not terminated prior to that date. NCI may terminate the Patent License Agreement if we are in default in the performance of any material obligation under the Patent License Agreement. We may unilaterally terminate the NCI Patent License Agreement in any country or territory upon sixty (60) days written notice. Under the NCI Patent License Agreement, we agreed to pay NCI certain non-creditable, nonrefundable license issue royalties, unreimbursed patent expenses for the licensed patent rights, a nonrefundable minimum annual royalty, earned royalties as a percentage of net sales and benchmark royalties.
DOTAP Chloride Enantiomer License Agreement with Merck Eprova AG.
 
Effective November 1, 2008, we entered into a DOTAP Chloride Enantiomer License (the “DOTAP License Agreement”) with Merck Eprova AG (“EPRO”), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license from EPRO technology to undertake development of products relating to the R-enantiomer and S-enantiomer of DOTAP Chloride for worldwide commercialization in a composition and method of inducing an immune response in a subject by administering at least one cationic lipid with or without an antigen. The DOTAP License Agreement expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the obligation to pay royalties applicable to such licensed product in such country. We have the right to unilaterally terminate the DOTAP License Agreement (in its entirety or on a licensed product-by-licensed product or country-by-country basis) at any time for any reason upon prior written notice. We paid a one-time royalty of CHF 100,000 as a result of the reverse merger between PDS and Edge Therapeutics, Inc.
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for Intramural-PHS Clinical Research with The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
 
Effective February 2, 2016, we entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (the “CRADA”) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”), pursuant to which the parties agreed to perform certain research and development activities as defined by the exhibited Research Plan. The principal goal of the CRADA is to determine whether our Versamune immunotherapeutic technology will be effective for enhancing delivery of cancer vaccines or viral vaccines or other immunotherapies developed by the Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, in mouse models and in human clinical studies. The CRADA provides for development, testing and studies to be conducted in conjunction with the Vaccine Branch involving Versamune and Multi-epitope (ME) T cell receptor gamma alternate reading frame protein peptide (TARP) to develop a treatment for prostate cancer using autologous dendritic cells and co- administered locally with ME TARP peptides co-formulated with Versamune immunotherapeutic technology in a non-cellular vaccine platform.
 
The term of the CRADA is five (5) years, starting February 2, 2016. Pursuant to Appendix A, PDS agreed to provide up to $1,000,000 but no less than $500,000 during the first year of the CRADA and up to $1,000,000 but no less than $750,000 per year for the remaining years of the CRADA for NCI to use in connection with acquiring technical, statistical, and administrative support for the clinical research activities, as well as to pay for supplies and travel expenses and, upon consent of the parties, to acquire support for a postdoctoral research fellow to conduct additional preclinical studies. The CRADA may be terminated by either party at any time by mutual written consent. Either party may unilaterally terminate the CRADA at any time by providing sixty (60) days written notice. If we terminate prior to the completion of all approved or active study protocol(s) pursuant to the CRADA, we must supply enough study test product to complete these study protocol(s) unless termination is for safety reasons. If the CRADA is mutually or unilaterally terminated by us before its expiration, we must pay non-cancellable obligations for personnel for a period of six (6) months after the termination date or until the expiration date of the CRADA, whichever is sooner. If we suspend development on the test article without the transfer of its active development efforts, assets, and obligations to a third party within ninety (90) days of discontinuation, NCI may continue development. In such event, we must transfer all information necessary to enable NCI to contract for the manufacture of the test article and grant NCI a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, paid-up license regarding same.

Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with MSD International GmbH.
 
 Effective May 19, 2017, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement (the “CTCSA”) with MSD International GmbH (“Merck”) pursuant to which we and Merck agreed to collaborate in a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, and preliminary efficacy of the concomitant and/or sequenced administration of the combination of a Merck compound (i.e., pembrolizumab, a humanized anti-human PD-1 monoclonal antibody) and our compound (i.e., PDS0101, a cationic lipid-based therapeutic vaccine combining HPV peptides) in treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer and high-risk human papillomavirus-16 (HPV 16) infection. The term of the CTCSA commenced on May 19, 2017 and will continue until the earlier of (i) delivery of the final study report and (ii) Study Completion (i.e., upon database lock of the Study results), or until terminated by either party. In the event the CTCSA is terminated by Merck upon a material breach by PDS, PDS must reimburse Merck for its direct manufacturing costs, such as manufacturing fees, raw materials, direct labor, freight and duty, factory overhead costs and its indirect manufacturing costs, such as allocations of indirect factory overhead and site support costs. This agreement was amended on October 28, 2019 to reflect the trial will be for first in line treatment of disease.


 On October 28, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the clinical trial collaboration agreement with Merck to evaluate the combination of our lead Versamune-based immunotherapy, PDS0101, with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), in a Phase II clinical trial. The modification to the clinical trial design to evaluate PDS0101 in combination with KEYTRUDA® as first-line treatment comes as a result of Merck’s approval by the FDA on June 10, 2019 for first line treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable recurrent HNSCC using KEYTRUDA® in combination with platinum and fluorouracil (FU) for all patients and as a single agent for patients whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test. The trial was initiated in November of 2020 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination as a first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer and high-risk human papillomavirus-16 (HPV16) infection.

Other Research and Development Agreements
 
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for Intramural-PHS Clinical Research with The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
 
 Effective April 22, 2019, PDS entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (the “CRADA”) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”), pursuant to which the parties agreed to perform certain research and development activities as defined by the exhibited Research Plan. Under the agreement, PDS will collaborate with the NCI’s Genitourinary Malignancies Branch (GMB) and Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) with plans to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating PDS0101 with novel immune-modulating agents M7824 and NHS-IL12 being studied at NCI as part of a CRADA with EMD Serono (Merck KGaA). The phase 2 clinical trial was initiated in June of 2020. The CRADA also involves preclinical evaluation of PDS0101 in combination with other therapeutic modalities upon the mutual agreement of both parties. In April 2020, this agreement was amended to include PDS0103, in preclinical and clinical development for treatment of ovarian, breast, colorectal and lung cancers.


 The term of the CRADA is five (5) years, starting April 22, 2019. Pursuant to Appendix A, we agreed to provide $110,000 annually, the first payment of which is to be made on the first anniversary the of the CRADA Effective date or upon the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial as the NIH Clinical Center, whichever comes first for NCI to use in connection with acquiring technical, statistical, and administrative support for the clinical research activities, as well as to pay for supplies and travel expenses and infrastructure costs. The CRADA may be terminated by either party at any time by mutual written consent. Either party may unilaterally terminate the CRADA at any time by providing sixty (60) days written notice. If we terminate prior to the completion of all approved or active study protocol(s) pursuant to the CRADA, we must supply enough study test product to complete these study protocol(s) unless termination is for safety reasons. If the CRADA is mutually or unilaterally terminated by PDS before its expiration, we must pay non-cancellable obligations for personnel for a period of six (6) months after the termination date or until the expiration date of the CRADA, whichever is sooner. If we suspend development on the test article without the transfer of its active development efforts, assets, and obligations to a third party within ninety (90) days of discontinuation, NCI may continue development. In such event, we must transfer all information necessary to enable NCI to contract for the manufacture of the test article and grant NCI a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, paid-up license regarding same.


Amended and Restated Material Transfer Agreement with Farmacore Biotechnology
 
 On December 4, 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Material Transfer Agreement with Farmacore Biotechnology to develop a novel tuberculosis (TB) immunotherapy based on Farmacore’s proprietary TB antigens and Versamune.  A prior material transfer agreement under which preliminary work commenced was Amended and Restated due to promising early preclinical results and to progress to the next development phase.  We will undertake product development and Farmacore will conduct preclinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of the product.  The term of the agreement extends until the end of the product testing period and may be terminated at any time by either party with 30 days’ notice.  This research plan has been delayed by the COVID-19 research restrictions in Brazil.
License and Collaboration Agreement with Farmacore Biotechnology
 
In June 2020, we announced a second collaboration with Farmacore to develop PDS0204, a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, combining Versamune with Farmacore’s recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigen.  Based on the highly promising antibody and T-cell data generated with PDS0203, we and Farmacore amended the agreement to prioritize the advancement of PDS0203 to human clinical trials.  Farmacore will retain commercialization rights in Latin America and revenues from Latin American sales will be shared between us and Farmacore.  Under the Agreement, Farmacore leads the regulatory and clinical trial effort and we contribute scientific expertise and operational support.  The Agreement term extends until the next phase of development and may be terminated with 30 days’ notice.  This Agreement has been extended through May 31, 2022.

COVID-19 Impact on Business and Operations
 
In December 2019, a novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, causing outbreaks of the coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19, that has now spread globally. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency. The Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d), in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic and on March 13 the President declared a national emergency in response to the pandemic. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown and rapidly evolving. The COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to negatively affect the Company’s liquidity and operations.  Since the pandemic began, variants of the disease have caused continuous waves of widespread transmission and illness, causing broad economic and supply chain disruptions.  The FDA issued and since updated guidance to assist sponsors in assuring the safety of trial participants, maintaining compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and minimizing risks to trial integrity.  Clinical trial sites have implemented institution-specific measures securing the safety of patients and staff to ensure the integrity of the trials in the face of the ongoing pandemic. The evolving COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the pace of enrollment in clinical trials in general and we may be negatively affected with our trials. COVID-19 related travel and other restrictions may also impact the potential for on-site monitoring visiting and audits and inspections by us, third parties, and regulators. There may be shortages of site personnel and equipment necessary for the timely completion of our trials. We are providing support to address these challenges, but these mitigation measures may not overcome the obstacles that the pandemic has wrought which continue to impede progress of clinical trials.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. We are aware of various established companies, including major pharmaceutical companies, broadly engaged in immunotherapies and vaccines in research and development that may compete directly with the products we are developing including Jansen Pharmaceuticals (part of J&J), Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck and Pfizer, among others. In addition, there are also many development-stage biotechnology companies in various immunotherapy and vaccine development including, but not limited to Inovio, Advaxis, Kite Pharma, Hookipa, Moderna, ZIOPHARM Oncology, Heat Biologics, Harpoon Therapeutics, Oncosec Medical, BioNTech, Osivax, Medicago, Vaxart, and Flugen. If one or more of these companies is successful in developing their technologies, it could materially impact our business.
 
While we believe that the Versamune and Infectimune platforms provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from many different sources, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies, as well as public and private research institutions. Any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing products and therapies as well as new products and immunotherapies that may become available in the future.
 
We anticipate that it will face intense and increasing competition as new immunotherapies enter the market and advanced technologies become available. PDS expects any products that it develops and commercializes to compete based on, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, availability of therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.  PDS’s competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than it may obtain approval for its products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before it is able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Federal, state and local government authorities in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological and pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, its activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Index
U.S. Product Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates biological drug products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. Products are also subject to certain other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial action. FDA decisions or enforcement actions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on PDS.
 
The process required by the FDA before a biological drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 
 
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practice regulations, or GLP, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that meets applicable requirements to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency/efficacy of the product that is the subject of the BLA based on results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies (including among other things clinical data, chemistry, and manufacturing and controls (CMC) data); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced, to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pre-approval inspection by the FDA of the sponsor (or any third party service providers) relative to oversight of clinical studies, clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA, and any manufacturing facilities; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------



Before testing any product candidate in humans, the product enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical studies of product candidates with small patient populations may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical studies or the results once the applicable clinical studies are completed. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical studies and places the study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, PDS cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
 


 Index
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection (for example, inclusion and exclusion criteria), and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and require IRB approval. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA law including GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in seriously ill subjects. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Multiple Phase 2 clinical studies may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical studies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical studies, which must be adequate and well-controlled, are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Although these are the typical phases of progression, and characteristics of the phases of a clinical development program, certain expedited programs allow for variations that could support a marketing application based on surrogate endpoints, intermediate clinical endpoints, or single-arm as opposed to comparative or placebo-controlled studies (for example, FDA could rely on well-controlled Phase 2 studies for evidence of effectiveness under certain circumstances).
 
Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up, or to gain other information about the product.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators of potential safety risks, from clinical trials or any other source, including for serious and unexpected adverse events and serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, any findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but no later than within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
 


 Index
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website, and other jurisdictions have similar laws that may apply.
 
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant application fee. For approved drugs, including BLA-licensed biological products, PDUFA also imposes an annual PDUFA program fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. No user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs unless the application for the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved, and applications for new molecular entities and original BLAs are generally discussed at advisory committee meetings unless the FDA determines that this type of consultation is not needed under the circumstances. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it is satisfied that the manufacturing establishments and processes supporting the BLA meet the appropriate requirements and comply with the applicable regulations (including cGMP requirements and adequate assurance for consistent commercial production of the product within required specifications). Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of regulated participants in clinical trials (for example, the sponsor, investigators responsible for specific sites, and CROs) to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with the IND and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 


 Index
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than PDS interprets the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
 
Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a new indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any products for which PDS receives FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses or consistent with the approved labeling, known as ‘off-label’ use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Recent court decisions have impacted the FDA’s enforcement activity regarding off-label promotion in light of First Amendment considerations; however, there are still significant risks in this area in part due to the potential False Claims Act exposure.  Further, the FDA has not materially changed its position on off-label promotion following legal setbacks on First Amendment grounds and the DOJ has consistently asserted in FCA briefings that “speech that serves as a conduit for violations of the law is not constitutionally protected.”
 
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 


 Index
The Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA imposes obligations on manufacturers of prescription biopharmaceutical products for commercial distribution, regulating the distribution of the products at the federal level, and sets certain standards for federal or state registration and compliance of entities in the supply chain (manufacturers and repackagers, wholesale distributors, third-party logistics providers, and dispensers). The DSCSA preempts certain previously enacted state pedigree laws and the pedigree requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA. Trading partners within the drug supply chain must now ensure certain product tracing requirements are met that they are doing business with other authorized trading partners; and they are required to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statements. Product identifier information (an aspect of the product tracing scheme) is also now required. The DSCSA requirements, development of standards, and the system for product tracing have been and will continue to be phased in over a period of years, with the FDA indicating enforcement discretion on certain aspects due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of product samples continues to be regulated under the PDMA, and some states also impose regulations on drug sample distribution.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of its product candidates under development.
 
Regulatory Exclusivities Applicable to Biologics and Related Matters
 
Abbreviated Licensure Pathway for Biosimilars: The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for “biosimilar” biologics, that is, those shown to be highly similar to an already-FDA-licensed reference biologic.  The abbreviated approval process for biosimilars under the BPCIA is similar in concept to the Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) for generic small molecule drugs established by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (“Hatch-Waxman”) amendments to the FDCA.  As with Hatch-Waxman, the goal of the BPCIA was to increase access to lower-priced versions of drugs, while balancing the need to continue incentivizing innovation in drug development. Biosimilarity is defined to mean that the proposed biologic is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product.  Further, a biosimilar may be determined to be “interchangeable” with the reference product, in which case the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product under state substitution laws, similar to the way generic small molecule drugs are substituted.  The higher standard of interchangeability requires a showing that the biosimilar is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference biologic in any given patient, and further that the risk to the patient in terms of safety, purity, and/or potency pf switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no more than using the reference product without switching.
Regulatory Exclusivities Applicable to Biologics Under the BPCIA: The BPCIA established certain regulatory exclusivities that provide reference biologics with prescribed periods of time during which competing biosimilars or interchangeable biosimilars may not be approved or may not be marketed.  Once its BLA is approved (“date of first licensure) the reference biologic is entitled to a period of four years after its date of first licensure during which time FDA is prohibited from accepting a marketing application that would seek approval of any products that are biosimilar to the branded product.  In addition, the reference biologic is entitled to a period of 12 years after its date of first licensure during which time FDA is prohibited from approving marketing applications for any products that are biosimilar to the branded product.  In addition, the first interchangeable biosimilar may be entitled to a period of one year after its date of first licensure, or other periods keyed to the outcome of patent litigation if instituted, during which FDA is prohibited from finding that any other biosimilars are interchangeable to the same reference biologic.  The reference biologic may also be entitled to regulatory exclusivity under other statutory provisions that apply to biologics and small molecule drugs.

Orphan Drug Exclusivity: Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biological products indicated for  a rare disease or condition, generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or in the alternative there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the biological product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.  The first BLA sponsor to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a period of 12 years after its date of first licensure during which time FDA is prohibited from approving marketing applications for any products that are biosimilar to the branded product.  There is an exception in certain limited circumstances, such as for a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition.  Other benefits of orphan drug designation include tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.
Pediatric Study Requirements and Pediatric Exclusivity: Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), a sponsor qualifies for “pediatric exclusivity” if it complies with a Written Request (WR) issued by FDA for pediatric studies.  The sponsor may apply to FDA to issue a WR.  Pediatric exclusivity operates by adding six months of exclusivity on to the end of the latest-expiring form of exclusivity and may apply to patent rights or to FDA regulatory exclusivities.  To qualify for pediatric exclusivity, at least one of those rights must still be currently in force at the time FDA approves the pediatric studies.
Patent Term Extensions: Patents have a limited lifespan. In most countries, including the U.S., the standard expiration of a patent is 20 years from the effective filing date. Various extensions of patent terms may be available in certain circumstances, for example where there are delays in obtaining FDA regulatory approvals that result in a reduction of the period of time during which we could market a product under patent protection.  In the U.S., such possible extensions include those permitted under Hatch-Waxman, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years to cover an FDA-approved product. The actual length of the extension will depend on the amount of patent term lost while the product was in clinical trials, and FDA must agree with our calculation of the time lost in regulatory review.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, PDS’s activities are potentially subject to regulation, either directly or indirectly, by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the criminal provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, and similar state laws, each as amended. The compliance and enforcement landscape, and related risk, is informed by government enforcement precedent and settlement history, Advisory Opinions, and Special Fraud Alerts.  Our approach to compliance may evolve over time in light of these types of developments.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. PDS’s practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. The lack of uniform court interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute combined with emerging, novel enforcement theories, makes compliance with the law difficult. The potential safe harbors available are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action, and we may decide to adjust our business practices or be subject to heightened scrutiny as a result. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant criminal fines, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid and follow-on civil litigation, among other things, for both entities and individuals.
 


 Index
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a per se false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, as discussed below.
 
The Criminal Healthcare Fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1347 prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. Federal criminal law at 18 U.S.C. § 1001, among other sections, prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act and similar state laws allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal or state government and to share in any monetary recovery. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government, whether directly or indirectly. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.
 
Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 
HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
Also, many states have enacted similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor, even extending to self-pay items and services.
 
PDS may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which it conducts its business. We are not a covered entity under HIPAA and have not functioned as a business associate under HIPAA that would cause the HIPAA Security Rule and provisions of the Privacy Rule to apply directly to us as a business associate.  To the extent that we ever function in a business associate capacity, HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and its respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Following enactment of the HITECH Act, HIPAA’s privacy and security standards now directly apply to business associates of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, and may apply more broadly thus complicating compliance efforts (for example, California recently enacted legislation — the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA — which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information, and creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches. The CCPA was recently amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, expanding certain consumer rights such as the right to know. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to these laws by the California legislature or how these laws will be interpreted and enforced. The potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA and implementing regulations are significant and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply.
 


 Index
Even for entities that are not deemed “covered entities” or “business associates” under HIPAA, according to the United States Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 USC § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule. The FTC’s authority under Section 5 is concurrent with HIPAA’s jurisdiction and with any action taken under state law.
 
Additionally, the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”. In 2022 the Sunshine Act reporting will be extended to payments and transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners (with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021). Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.
 
In order to distribute products commercially, PDS must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical studies and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of PDS’s activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between pharmaceutical companies and providers and patients, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the industry. Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management’s attention from the business, even if investigators ultimately find that no violation has occurred.
 
If PDS operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, PDS may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties; damages; fines; disgorgement; exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid; injunctions; private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow it to enter into government contracts; contractual damages; reputational harm; administrative burdens; diminished profits and future earnings; and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations; any of which could adversely affect PDS’s ability to operate its business and its results of operations.
 
In addition to the laws discussed above, we may see more stringent state and federal privacy legislation in the future, as the increased cyber-attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic have heightened attention to data privacy and security in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. We cannot predict where new legislation might arise, the scope of such legislation, or the potential impact to our business and operations.

Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which PDS obtains regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which PDS receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. PDS may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its tablet product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. PDS’s product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable PDS to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development.
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The marketability of any product candidates for which it receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement, or require onerous prior approvals or other restricted access. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and PDS expects the pressure on healthcare pricing will continue to increase. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which PDS receives regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
U.S. Healthcare Reform
 
In recent years, there have been numerous initiatives on the federal and state levels in the United States for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. PDS anticipates that current and future U.S. legislative healthcare reforms may result in additional downward pressure on the price that PDS receives for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm its business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent PDS from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize its product candidates. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
For example, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which was signed into law in the United States in March 2010, was enacted to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Act. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact health care laws and regulations PDS’s business.
 


 Index
There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. For example, U.S. federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies seeking information about pricing practices in connection with an investigation into pricing practices being conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice. Several state attorneys general also have commenced drug pricing investigations and filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, and the U.S. Senate has publicly investigated a number of pharmaceutical companies relating to price increases and pricing practices. Proposed legislation has been designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Drug pricing is and will remain a key legislative issue in the coming year, although we do not know the steps the Biden Administration will take with respect to drug pricing.
 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, which could limit the amounts that state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and result in additional pricing pressures. The boom in state laws targeting drug pricing is unprecedented and the requirements are not uniform from state to state, creating additional compliance and commercialization challenges for manufacturers. If PDS is able to obtain marketing approval for one or more of our products, our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected if these or other inquiries were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of any products for which we obtain marketing approval.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical studies, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of its products. Whether or not PDS obtains FDA approval for a product, it would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
European Union member states and other foreign jurisdictions, including Switzerland, have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. Moreover, the collection and use of personal health data in the European Union, which was formerly governed by the provisions of the European Union Data Protection Directive, was replaced with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, in May 2018. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States, provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The recent implementation of the GDPR has increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, including in clinical trials, and we may in the future be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management’s attention and increase our cost of doing business. In addition, new regulation or legislative actions regarding data privacy and security (together with applicable industry standards) may increase our costs of doing business. In this regard, we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.
