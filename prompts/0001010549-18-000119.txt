Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources, should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As discussed in the condensed consolidated financial statements, our recurring net losses and inability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations and sustain our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans concerning these matters are also discussed in the condensed consolidated financial statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including information with respect to our plans, intentions and strategies for our businesses. Our actual results may differ materially from those estimated or projected in any of these forward-looking statements.
 Unless the context otherwise suggests, “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar terms in this report, as well as references to “UMED” and “Greenway Technologies,” all refer to Greenway Technologies, Inc, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Greenway Innovative Energy, Inc., unless the context requires otherwise.
 Company Overview
 Greenway Technologies was originally incorporated as Dynalyst Manufacturing Corporation (“Dynalyst”) under the laws of the State of Texas on March 13, 2002.

In connection with the merger with Universal Media Corporation (“UMC”), a Nevada corporation, on August 17, 2009, we changed our name to Universal Media Corporation. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger, and Universal Media Corporation was the acquiring company on the basis that Universal Media Corporation’s senior management became the entire senior management of the merged entity and there was a change of control of Dynalyst. The transaction was accounted for as recapitalization of Dyanlyst’s capital structure. In connection with the merger, Dynalyst issued 57,500,000 restricted common shares to the shareholders of Universal Media Corporation for 100% of Universal Media Corporation.
 On August 18, 2009, Dynalyst approved the amendment of its articles of incorporation and filed with the Texas Secretary of State an amendment to change our name to Universal Media Corporation and approved the increase in authorized shares to 300,000,000 shares of common A stock, par value $0.0001 and 20,000,000 shares of common B, par value $0.0001.
 On March 23, 2011, Universal Media Corporation approved the amendment of its articles of incorporation and filed with the Texas Secretary of State an amendment to change our name to UMED Holdings, Inc.
 On June 22, 2017, Greenway Technologies, Inc. approved the amendment of our certificate of formation and filed on June 23, 2017, with the Texas Secretary of State, to change our name to Greenway Technologies, Inc.
 GTL Technology
 In August 2012, Greenway Technologies (formerly, UMED) acquired 100% of Greenway Innovative Energy, Inc. (“GIE”) which owns patents and trade secrets for a proprietary technology to convert natural gas into synthesis gas (“syngas”). Based on a new, breakthrough process called Fractional Thermal Oxidation™ (“FTO”), GIE’s G-Reformer™, combined with a Fischer-Tropsch (“FT”) process, offers an economical and scalable method to converting natural gas to liquid fuel (the “GTL Technology”).
 On June 26, 2017, Greenway Technologies, in conjunction with the University of Texas at Arlington (“UTA”), announced that it had successfully demonstrated its GTL technology at the Conrad Greer Laboratory at UTA proving the viability of the GTL Technology. Greenway Technologies now plans to commercialize the GTL Technology and is in discussions with several oil and gas companies, and other individuals and organizations regarding joint venture funding for its first GTL plant using our proprietary processes. Should an agreement be made, the joint venture relationship will provide funding at a level of $15M to $30M with an ongoing profit-sharing arrangement between Greenway Technologies and the joint venture partner. Our GTL Technology is unique in that it allows for plants with a smaller footprint, versus legacy large-scale technologies, combined with lower up-front and ongoing costs.
 One of several important applications for our GTL Technology is the harvesting of stranded natural gas. There is an abundance of stranded natural gas located throughout the United States and the world with no practical way to transfer the gas to existing distribution systems for sale. This valuable energy resource sits untapped, unused, or more harmfully, is vented to the atmosphere. Our GTL Technology allows this valuable energy resource to be harvested and monetized.
 Greenway Technologies’ breakthrough patented GTL Technology offers a solution to this energy challenge. Our system allows for relatively small by comparison, scalable plants, to be deployed at geographically dispersed locations to convert natural gas into synthetic fuel that is transportable and can be sold directly to markets without the need for additional processing at a refinery.
 Our research has been centered on developing a production-scale FT system (“the Technology”) to accommodate the needs of smaller gas plays that are increasingly beginning to characterize natural gas production within the United Stated and elsewhere. We are currently seeking funding of $20M to build the initial GTL plant.
 Besides the fuel products, the Company will produce water and can produce electricity using the heat from the G-reformer.
 Since March 1, 2016, we have raised approximately $3,746,750 and have built a small-scaled prototype unit at UTA, pursuant to an SRA with UTA.

Mining Interest
 In December 2010, UMED acquired the mineral mining rights to approximately 1,440 acres of BLM placer mining claims in Mohave County, Arizona for 5,066,000 shares of our restricted common stock. We staked the claims in September 2011, and, since then, have maintained them and plan to establish an exploration and development plan, when capital is available. We plan to drill test holes and test the samples on our claims to determine the potential value of the various metals that may be located on the claims. Early indications, from samples taken and processed, provides reason to believe that the potential recovery value of the metals located on the 1,440 acres is significant, but actual mining and processing will determine the ultimate value which may be realized. Funding of $500,000 is being sought to begin certified assaying, to determine the viability of continued development of our mining claims. However, it should be noted that at no time has Greenway Technologies been a mining operator.
Going Concern
 As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statement, the Company has liabilities in excess of assets by $2.8 million as of December 31, 2017. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we used net cash of $2,230,759 for operating activities. Our ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt and dependent upon necessary capital and financing to fund ongoing our operations and achieving a profitable level of operations. We do not have the financial resources and do not have any commitments for funding from unrelated parties or any other firm agreements that will provide working capital to our business segments. We cannot give any assurance that we will locate any funding or enter into any agreements that will provide the required operating capital. We have been depended on the sale of equity and advances from shareholders to provide it with working capital to date.
 These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm issued a going concern qualification in their report dated April 4, 2018, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 While we are attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement our business plan and generate revenues provides the opportunity for the registrant to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the implementation of our business plan and generate revenues.
 Risks Related to Our Proposed GTL Operations
 We are affected by the risks faced by natural gas owners who we expect will be our future customers. Our prospective customers are engaged in economically sensitive and competitive businesses. As a result, we will be indirectly affected by all the risks facing natural gas owners, which are beyond our control. Our results of operations will depend, in part, on the financial strength of our customers and our customers’ ability to compete effectively in the marketplace and manage their risks. Many of these risks are discussed below.
 Our Legal Rights and Remedies are Uncertain in the Event of a Default by a Joint Venture Partner. In the event we are required to take any legal action under a joint venture agreement, such as to repossess our equipment, we would be required to do so in the courts, and under the laws, of the country where the equipment is located. The legal systems of foreign countries may not allow for the repossession of equipment as quickly and as cost-effectively as in the U.S., with the result that we may face greater delays and expenses in exercising any rights under our joint venture agreement. Consequently, losses due to a default by a lessee may be greater than otherwise would be the case.
 Competition
 We believe that existing and new competitors will continue to improve their GTL offerings and introduce new GTL methods with competitive price and performance characteristics. We expect that we will be required to continue to invest in product development and productivity improvements to compete effectively in our markets. Our competitors could develop a

more efficient GTL product or undertake more aggressive and costly marketing campaigns than ours, which may adversely affect our marketing strategies and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include:
 
· | Sales and marketing efforts; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rapid and effective development of new, unique GTL techniques; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pricing.
--+---------

 In periods of reduced demand for our GTL Technology, we can either choose to maintain market share by reducing our prices to meet competition or maintain prices, which would likely sacrifice market share. Sales and overall profitability could be reduced in either case. In addition, if competitors enter our existing markets, we may be unable to compete successfully against existing or new competition.
 Most of our potential competitors have far greater resources than we have and have far greater experience in the GTL industry than we possess.
 Currently, there is significant competition for personnel and financial capital to be deployed in the oil and gas extraction industries and mining and mineral extraction industries. Therefore, it is difficult for smaller companies such as Greenway Technologies to attract investment for its various business activities. We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to compete for capital funds, and without adequate financial resources management cannot assure that we will be able to compete in our business activities.
 Patents and Intellectual Property
 As of December 31, 2017, GIE, our wholly-owned subsidiary, owns United States Patents Nos. 8,574,501 B1 and 8,795,597 B2 covering its mobile GTL conversion technology for the purpose of converting natural gas to clean synthetic fuels.
 In the United States, a patent’s term may be up to 21 years if the earliest claimed filing date is that of a provisional application. Other legal provisions may, however, shorten or lengthen a patent’s term. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent. Alternatively, a patent’s term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date.
 GIE also owns a provisional patent for its G-Reformer™ front-end reforming process.
 Impact of Inflation
 We are affected by inflation along with the rest of the economy. Specifically, our costs to complete our proposed GTL units could rise if specific components needed see a rise in cost.
Adequacy of Working Capital
 We will apply great efforts to raise through equity or debt offerings what we feel is sufficient working capital for our intended business plan by various means. If we are not able to raise additional capital, we would not be able to continue operations and our business may fail.
 Disruptions in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise additional financing. To properly deploy our GTL Technology, we will need to construct GTL units. We currently do not have any arrangements to obtain debt or equity capital to finance the construction of GTL units, and if we do not obtain such capital we may be unable to expand our anticipated operations. Severe disruptions in the commercial credit markets in the recent past have resulted in a

tightening of credit markets worldwide. Liquidity in the global credit markets was severely contracted by these market disruptions, making it difficult and costly to obtain new lines of credit or to refinance existing debt. The effect of these disruptions was widespread and difficult to quantify. While economic conditions have recently improved, that trend may not continue and the extent of the current economic improvement is unknown. Any future disruptions in the commercial credit markets may impact liquidity in the global credit market as greatly, or even more, than in recent years.
 Our business and financing plan may be dependent upon completion of future financings. If the credit environment worsens, it may be difficult to obtain any additional financing on acceptable terms, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to complete our planned projects, and as a consequence, our results of operations and business plans. Should general economic conditions not improve, if we are unable to obtain sufficient funding such that completion of planned projects is not probable, or should management decide to abandon certain projects, all or a portion of our investment to date in our planned projects could be lost and would result in an impairment charge.
 Our Financial Results May Be Affected by Factors Outside of Our Control
 We will be unable to pay our obligations in the normal course of business or service our debt in a timely manner throughout 2018 without raising additional debt or equity capital. There can be no assurance that additional debt or equity capital will be raised.
 Greenway Technologies is currently evaluating strategic alternatives that include the following: (i) raising of capital, or (ii) issuance of debt instruments. This process is ongoing and can be lengthy and has inherent costs. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any specific action to alleviate our 12 month working capital needs or result in any other transaction.
 We currently have a need of approximately $150,000 per month to sustain operations and to pay UTA for the SRAs until our first GTL unit is completed and deployed.
 Our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. Our anticipated expense levels are based, in part, on our estimates of future revenues and may vary from projections. We may be unable to adjust spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenues shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our planned
 expenditures would materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future performance.
 Key Personnel
 Our future financial success depends to a large degree upon the personal efforts of our key personnel, D. Patrick Six, our chairman, president, chief financial officer, and director, Raymond Wright, our corporate secretary officer, and director, and president of GIE, our subsidiary, and Thomas Phillips, the vice president of operations of GIE, all of whom will play a major role in securing the services of those persons who can develop our business strategy upon receipt of sufficient funds to pay for such services either from success through receipt of funds from earnings, borrowing or sales of our securities. Greenway Technologies has only one employee, D. Patrick Six, at the date of this report. GIE has two employees, Raymond Wright and Thomas Phillips, at the date of this report. We do not have any other employees at this time. In the future, when we need other persons for aspects of our GTL work and other functions, we will hire persons under service agreements as consultants, part-time and full-time employees as necessary. While we intend to employ additional personnel in order to minimize the critical dependency upon any one person, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the persons needed. We do not have any arrangements for the hiring of any persons at this time. We do not anticipate any difficulty in securing the services of required personnel.
Consultants
 We plan to use outside consultants to perform the engineering and design work on the GTL Technology, until such time as capital funds are available to hire in-house staff. In that regard we have Sponsored Research Agreements with UTA

 for catalyst and heat exchange research and have contracted with UTA to build a small-scale GTL unit at the university. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Consulting Agreements.”
 Adequacy of Working Capital
 We hope to generate sufficient capital to fund our business plan through investments in our securities, revenues from operations, or borrowings. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financing Activities.” If we are not able to raise additional capital as described above, we would not be able to continue and our business would fail. As of the date of this report, we do not have any commitments for financing.
