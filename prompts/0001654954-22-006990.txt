ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS

GrowLife, Inc. (“GrowLife” or the “Company”) is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. We were founded in 2012 with the Closing of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with SGT Merger Corporation. 

The Company’s total revenue declined 11%. Our revenue reduction of approximately $0.8 million was the result of a major decline of the hydroponics business during 2021. On the positive side, annual sales of our EZ-CLONE subsidiary rose 14% during the year and gross margin increased from 42.6% to 46.3% year to over year and operating expenses were reduced 10% to $4.4 million. 

Also previously reported, we did not close the purchase of the remaining 49% of stock of EZ-CLONE that was due on July 15, 2020 and the founders of EZ-CLONE entered into litigation against the Company. 

The GrowLife executive team has focused on exploring new business alternatives for the Company and settlement on the EZ-CLONE litigation matter.  As a result, the Company has decided to divest away from any Cannabis-related investments and focused on functional mushroom business opportunities.  We see a growing market, intend to service our existing distribution channel and will build on opportunities in the medicinal mushroom industry.  We believe this is an opportunity for our customers, shareholders and one where GrowLife is uniquely positioned to capitalize on.  The Company’s goal is to become the nation’s largest mushroom supplier focused on serving more providers of mushroom-based products of high quality, exceptional value and competitive price. 

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased by $801,700 to $6,199,000 from $7,001,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease resulted a major decline in our involvement in the hydroponics business in 2020. The reduction of the hydroponics sales personnel and the impact of the pandemic on the hydroponics segment during the year ended December 31, 2020 and early 2021, resulted in hydroponics revenue declining to $35,000 in 2021 as compared to $1,568,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The EZ-CLONE revenue from its line of products for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $6,164,000 as compared to $5,433,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Employees

As of December 31, 2021, we had 13 full-time employees. Marco Hegyi, our Chief Executive Officer, and the Company remains based in Kirkland, Washington. In addition, we employ 12 full-time employees at EZ-CLONE in Sacramento, CA. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. 
Key Partners

Our key customers have become the cultivation buyers of cloning systems throughout various states and these products are sold through direct sales, retailers and distributors.  Therefore, our key suppliers include distributors and manufacturers including EZ-CLONE. All the products purchased and resold are applicable to indoor growing for organics, greens, and plant-based medicines. 
Competition

Covering two countries across all cultivator segments creates competitors that also serve as partners. Large commercial cultivators have found themselves willing to assume their own equipment support by buying large volume purchased directly from certain suppliers and distributors such as Hawthorne and HydroFarm. Other key competitors on the retail side consist of local and regional hydroponic resellers of indoor growing equipment. On the e-commerce business our competition includes GrowersHouse.com, Hydrobuilder.com and smaller online resellers using Amazon and eBay e-commerce market systems. 
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights

Our intellectual property consists of brands and their related trademarks and websites, customer lists and affiliations, product know-how and technology, and marketing intangibles. Our other intellectual property is primarily in the form of trademarks and domain names. We also hold rights to several website addresses related to our business including websites that are actively used in our day-to-day business such as www.growlifeinc.com and www.ezclone.com. We have a policy of entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, some of our vendors and customers as necessary.

Acquisition of EZ-CLONE

On October 15, 2018, we closed the Purchase and Sale Agreement with EZ-CLONE Enterprises, Inc., a California corporation (the “Agreement”). On November 5, 2019, we amended the Agreement with one 24.5% shareholder of EZ-CLONE Enterprises, Inc. (“EZ-CLONE”), to extend the date to purchase the remaining 49% of stock of EZ-CLONE in exchange for a 20% extension fee (a total of $171,000 for the 49% or $85,500 for each 24.5% shareholder) of the $855,000 cash payable at the earlier of the closing of $2,000,000 in funding or nine months (July 2020). The Company did not close the purchase of the remaining 49% of stock of EZ-CLONE by the extended deadline.

On September 15, 2020, we received notice that William Blackburn and Brad Mickelsen (“Plaintiffs”), minority shareholders of EZ-CLONE Enterprises, Inc., a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, filed a complaint against the Company and its officers Marco Hegyi and Mark Scott (“Officers”), in the Superior Court of California, County of Sacramento (“Complaint”) for claims related to breach under the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated October 15, 2018 between the Company and Plaintiffs. The Complaint also alleges that the Company and its Officers made certain false representations and other claims to consummate the Transaction and as a result has failed to complete the second closing as required under Purchase and Sale Agreement. As of December 4, 2020, the Company’s officers were dismissed from the case. The Plaintiffs are seeking rescission of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, unspecified damages in excess of ten thousand dollars, and other equitable relief.

On September 15, 2020, we filed a notice of removal with the California Superior Court, County of Sacramento and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California.  The case was removed to Federal District Court for the Eastern District of California and Plaintiffs filed an Ex Parte Application for TRO and an Order for Preliminary Injunction with the Federal Court.  The TRO was granted on September 16, 2020 and a preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled for September 29, 2020.  After reviewing all pleadings and oral arguments at the hearing, the Court issued a ruling granting Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction.  The parties provided legal briefs to the Federal court to determine if rescission should be granted.  The Court did not reach a decision on this issue, and denied without prejudice, the Company’s effort to reverse the preliminary injunction.  The Company is currently reviewing all options in this matter including settlement discussions. 

As of December 31, 2021, we have recorded a liability of $2,131,000 related to the acquisition of which a $1,105,000 is payable in stock and $1,026,000 is payable in cash.
