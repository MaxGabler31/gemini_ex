Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a global medical technology company focused on the care of patients of all ages suffering from the respiratory distress often associated with complex lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), congestive heart failure (“CHF”), pneumonia, asthma and COVID-19. Our strategy is to become the world’s preeminent complex lung disease patient management company by combining digital, clinical and device solutions to create a healthcare ecosystem focused on improving the lives of complex lung disease patients while reducing the cost of their care. Our device solutions are focused on High Velocity Nasal Insufflation (“HVNI”, or “High Velocity Therapy”), which delivers non-invasive ventilatory support to patients by providing heated, humidified, oxygenated air at high velocities through a small-bore nasal interface, and on closed loop control systems such as our Oxygen Assist Module, designed to automatically maintain SPO2 levels within a specified range for a defined period of time. Our digital solutions are focused on at home patient monitoring, using proprietary algorithms to predict impending respiratory episodes before they occur and coordinate timely intervention, obviating the need for costly hospital admissions and minimizing patient distress. Our clinical solutions include affiliations with leading pulmonologists and other clinicians, offering both in person and virtual care, as well as our own call center staffed by experienced nurses. While these device, digital and clinical solutions function independently, we believe leveraging the three together can create a unique healthcare ecosystem, focused on delivering high quality, efficient respiratory care. 
  High Velocity Therapy is an advanced form of high flow therapy that is differentiated due to its ability to deliver breathing gases, including oxygen, at a high velocity, for the treatment of spontaneously breathing patients with either Type 1 hypoxic respiratory distress, like that experienced by patients with pneumonia or COVID-19, or Type 2 hypercapnic respiratory distress, like that experienced by patients with COPD. Our Precision Flow systems, which use High Velocity Therapy technology, are clinically validated alternatives to, and address many limitations of, the current standard of care for the treatment of respiratory distress in a hospital setting. Our next generation High Velocity Therapy system, known as HVT 2.0, received 510k clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in 2021 and is currently in limited market release. The HVT 2.0 platform is approved for therapy in multiple settings of care, including the home. As of December 31, 2021, more than 3.3 million patients have been treated with our Precision Flow systems, and we have a global installed base of over 35,200 units, an increase of 22.9% compared to December 31, 2020, and an increase of 112.0 % compared to December 31, 2019.
 Our business was significantly transformed during 2020 due to increased demand for our High Velocity Therapy technology for treatment of COVID-19 patients, as evidenced by year over year revenue growth of 161.4% from 2019 to 2020, and a 53.5% compounded annual revenue growth rate from 2019 to 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to this transformation in at least two primary ways: first, it resulted in increased awareness of the unique efficacy of our High Velocity Therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, and generally, resulting in high global demand for our technology and the concomitant rapid growth of our installed base referred to above. Today, our brand is a recognized and respected name in an ever-increasing number of hospitals around the world. Second, many respiratory distress patients who require ventilatory support are initially treated in a hospital’s emergency department (“ED”) with the goal of stabilizing these patients with a non-invasive ventilation therapy so their underlying condition can be treated. Our focus on hospital emergency departments as an effective entry point for our products resulted in our systems being in the right place at the right time when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. This exposed a significant number of new physicians to the efficacy of our High Velocity Therapy technology, especially as they were able to see patients moved out of the emergency room and into lower acuity settings in the hospital after receiving our High Velocity Therapy. We expect that increased awareness among physicians of the efficacy of our High Velocity Therapy to treat respiratory distress will result in expanded use of our products to treat all forms of Type 1 and Type 2 respiratory distress in a variety of settings. 
 Patients with both Type 1 and Type 2 respiratory distress can have severe difficulty breathing and inability to sustain sufficient oxygen levels or remove retained carbon dioxide in their lungs and airways. These patients often require immediate respiratory support ranging from supplemental oxygen therapy for mild cases to invasive mechanical ventilators for severe cases. Many of these patients are initially treated in the emergency department. Patients who cannot be adequately stabilized are often transferred to the intensive care unit, or ICU, a high cost and capacity-constrained setting in the hospital. An independent third-party study published in the June 2005 issue of Critical Care Medicine determined that the average cost for a typical three day stay in the ICU in the United States was $13,347. This cost increased by an average of 47% to $19,558 when the patient required mechanical ventilation. To the extent our products are able to reduce the number of patients requiring transfer to the ICU, these treatment costs can be reduced.

The market for the treatment of respiratory distress is large and growing. Based on industry sources, we estimate that there are over 12 million patients who suffer from respiratory distress each year in the United States and select international markets that could benefit from our High Velocity Therapy technology. As a result, we believe the annual total addressable global market for our High Velocity Therapy technology exceeds $1.5 billion. We believe that an aging population and growing prevalence of heart failure and COPD will lead to an increase in the size of our total addressable market in the future. Additionally, if, as many believe, COVID-19 is now an annual, endemic respiratory illness that will recur in various mutations around the world, the size of our total addressable market already has increased.
 Our High Velocity Therapy technology competes with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, or NiPPV, the traditional standard of care for respiratory distress. NiPPV uses pressure to drive gas in and out of a patient’s lungs. It is typically administered through the fitting of an air-tight mask over the patient’s nose and mouth and tightening a strap around the patient’s head to secure the mask in place. NiPPV delivered through a mask is associated with increased patient discomfort and anxiety and can cause facial skin ulceration and trauma to the lungs. The mask complicates the care required to support a patient because they cannot talk, eat, drink or take oral medications while wearing the tight-fitting mask, and must time their breaths to be in sync with the bursts of air being forced into their lungs. NiPPV can also be delivered through a tight-fitting mask that only covers the nose or tight-fitting prongs that seal the external opening of each nostril. These alternatives, which usually require a chin strap to limit air leaks by keeping the patient’s mouth closed, can also cause skin ulceration around the nose and nostrils. Third-party clinical evidence published in the June 2000, January 2009 and February 2013 issues of Critical Care Medicine suggests that delivering NiPPV through a mask that covers both the nose and mouth is generally preferred from an effectiveness perspective over a mask that only covers the nose or nasal prongs, particularly in the acute setting.
 NiPPV is typically an escalation therapy, which means that practitioners often start at low pressures and increase as tolerated until the patient stabilizes. Patients treated with NiPPV are often transferred to the ICU due to the high level of patient monitoring required. Clinical evidence published in the November 2007 issue of Respiratory Care shows that approximately 30% of patients are intolerant of NiPPV masks, which can cause them to become non-compliant with treatment. Patients who cannot tolerate NiPPV are often sedated and potentially intubated in preparation for mechanical ventilation. Intubation involves the insertion of a plastic tube into the trachea to maintain an open airway. Mechanical ventilation is a complex, invasive procedure that is associated with increased costs of care, lengths of stay, incidence of infections, ventilator dependence and mortality.
 In contrast to NiPPV, our High Velocity Therapy technology delivers heated, humidified and oxygenated air at a high velocity to patients through a comfortable small-bore nasal interface to help reduce the work of breathing. Our Precision Flow systems, are clinically validated alternatives to NiPPV, and we believe they also provide the following primary benefits for the patient, the clinician and the hospital:
  
• | meaningful improvement in patient comfort and compliance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | facilitation of patient admissions to lower intensity, lower cost and less capacity-constrained care settings;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced risk of pressure ventilation related side effects; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinician workflow benefits, including easier administration and reduced patient monitoring.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A compelling body of clinical data supports the efficacy and benefits of High Velocity Therapy technology for respiratory distress. In 2018, the FDA, granted our de novo request for an expanded indication for the Precision Flow Hi-VNI system, which incorporates our High Velocity Therapy technology. The expanded indication was based on compelling clinical evidence and currently identifies this system as a high velocity nasal insufflation device that provides ventilatory support to spontaneously breathing patients suffering from respiratory distress in a hospital setting. The FDA also created a new classification, known as QAV, under which this system is currently the only product listed. We believe this expanded QAV indication, which encompasses actual ventilatory support in the indicated circumstances, clinically differentiates our system from other “high flow” systems, which are not indicated for the provision of ventilatory support and validates High Velocity Therapy as an attractive alternative to NiPPV. We are presently in the process of obtaining the QAV designation for our next generation HVT 2.0 platform, which we expect to receive from the FDA in 2022. Our goal is for our High Velocity Therapy products to become the standard of care for the treatment of respiratory distress in the hospital, in the home, and during EMS transport. 
 In certain countries outside the United States, we currently offer our Oxygen Assist Module, or OAM, which launched in the United Kingdom, select European markets, and Israel in late 2020. The Oxygen Assist Module can be used with most versions of our Precision Flow system as well as the HVT 2.0. The Oxygen Assist Module helps clinicians maintain a patient’s pulse oxygen saturation, or SpO2, within a target SpO2 range over a greater period of time while requiring 
 2


significantly fewer manual adjustments to the equipment. Maintenance of the prescribed oxygen saturation range may reduce the health risks associated with dosing too much, or too little, oxygen, particularly in neonates. In neonates, these risks include visual or developmental impairment or death. 
 We sell our Precision Flow systems to hospitals through a direct sales organization in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany and through distributors in other select countries outside of those countries. Our Oxygen Assist Module is sold through a direct sales organization in the United Kingdom and Germany and through distributors in Europe and the Middle East. We are in the process of seeking FDA approval to market the Oxygen Assist Module in the United States. In addition, we employ field-based clinical educators who focus on medical education and training in the effective use of our products and help facilitate increased adoption and utilization. We focus on physicians, respiratory therapists and nurses who work in acute hospital settings, including the ED and adult, pediatric and neonatal ICUs. Our relationship with these clinicians is particularly important, as it enables our products to follow patients through the care continuum. As of December 31, 2021, we have sold our Precision Flow systems to over 2,200 hospitals across the United States, and in over 40 countries outside of the United States.
 Presently, our revenues are derived principally from sales of Precision Flow systems and sales of the single-use disposable vapor transfer cartridges these systems require. We also derive revenue from ancillary products and services related to our Precision Flow systems. Due to demand for our High Velocity Therapy technology during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 we generated revenue primarily from sales of our Precision Flow systems. However, historically we have generated revenue primarily from sales of the disposable products utilized with our Precision Flow systems, and in the future, we believe we will generate revenue primarily from the sales of disposable products utilized with our systems. Our revenue grew from $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $113.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenue from single-use disposables represented approximately 45.1% and 58.8% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and increased 17.5% on a year over year basis. During this time, our international revenue also grew, representing 21.1% of our total revenue in 2020 and 25.7% of our total revenue in 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, we incurred net losses of $51.1 million, $51.5 million, and $59.8 million, respectively.
 We believe our anticipated growth will be driven by the following strengths: disruptive High Velocity Therapy technology supported by a compelling body of clinical and economic evidence; the expanded FDA indications we received for our next generation HVT 2.0 platform, enabling use in multiple settings of care; deep expertise in the area of closed loop control, machine learning based respiratory technology, the first example of which is our Oxygen Assist Module; new FDA clearances and/or approvals for our product pipeline, including the Oxygen Assist Module; a recurring revenue model with high visibility on our disposables utilization across a robust global installed base; an expanding digital and clinical footprint we expect will accelerate our strategy to become the world’s preeminent complex lung disease patient management company; dedicated respiratory sales forces in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, which we expect to extend to other growing international markets; experienced international distributors; a comprehensive approach to market development with established clinical and digital marketing teams; a robust and growing intellectual property portfolio; and an experienced senior management team and board members with deep industry practice.
 In late 2020, we acquired HGE Health Care Solutions, LLC (“HGE”) a company which created a digital disease management solution for ongoing management of chronic respiratory disease. HGE developed a clinical services platform designed to help providers, payors and hospitals improve the quality of life of their COPD patients and reduce their cost of care by remotely monitoring their daily condition and responding early to changes that could signal an impending worsening of their COPD condition (known as an “exacerbation”). COPD exacerbations often result in emergency room visits and hospital admissions. HGE’s platform was built based on clinical protocols and supported by 12 years of research focused on finding a better way to provide care for a geographically and socio-economically diverse COPD patient population. 
 Unlike other disease management solutions, HGE effectively engages both patients and providers on a daily basis. A patient’s symptoms are typically logged daily via a mobile application, quickly establishing a baseline. From there, HGE’s intelligent platform enables clinicians to triage and respond to patients in need with same-day treatment plans that address current symptoms and seek to prevent impending exacerbations. 
 In mid-2021, we re-branded HGE as Vapotherm Access and launched “Vapotherm Access – Post Care” to hospitals, a program dedicated to reducing 30-day readmissions of recently discharged COPD patients. We also launched “Vapotherm Access – 365” to hospitals, providers and payors, extending the 30 days of post care to full year patient monitoring. As part of this initiative, we established a small direct sales force focused exclusively on Vapotherm Access- Post Care and Vapotherm Access – 365. We believe our Vapotherm Access platform can be adapted to address other respiratory 
 3


conditions and will help us achieve the goal of making our High Velocity Therapy products the standard of care in a variety of clinical settings.
 
Our strategy includes: attracting new customers while driving penetration within our existing customer base, with a specific focus on educating those customers who first utilized our technology to treat the Type 1 respiratory distress experienced by COVID-19 patients on the efficacy of our High Velocity Therapy technology at also treating Type 2 respiratory distress such as COPD ; continuing to build a preeminent respiratory sales team to facilitate further adoption; increasing awareness of our solutions through social media, digital marketing, and medical education programs; continuing to drive manufacturing cost efficiencies and leveraging our infrastructure to expand margins; leveraging our innovation capabilities to expand our High Velocity Therapy and Oxygen Assist Module technologies; scaling our Vapotherm Access service offerings and integrating them with our other solutions; and expanding the range of respiratory conditions for which the Vapotherm Access platform can be utilized.
 
In late 2021, we affiliated with a leading pulmonology practice in Tulsa, Oklahoma known as Pulmonary Care Innovations, PLLC d/b/a RespirCare (“RespirCare”). RespirCare provides in-person and virtual care to COPD and other respiratory distress patients in Oklahoma (and potentially other states with licensure reciprocity). This affiliation was structured as an acquisition of RespirCare’s management company, PCI Management Group LLC (“PCI”) and PCI’s arrangements with RespirCare and its physician shareholder. Our affiliation with RespirCare is an important element of our strategy to become the world’s preeminent complex lung disease patient management company. Operating within established legal safe harbors and applicable regulatory requirements, we may in the future enter into similar arrangements with other participants in the complex lung disease continuum of care.
 Overview of High Velocity Therapy Technology
 High Velocity Therapy technology delivers heated, humidified and oxygenated air at a high velocity through a small-bore nasal interface to treat patients of all ages suffering from respiratory distress. Our Precision Flow systems, which use High Velocity Therapy technology, can treat nearly all patients in respiratory distress who would not otherwise require mechanical ventilation, regardless of whether they are in need of an oxygen-based therapy or NiPPV. There is a subset of patients who will require NiPPV that we might otherwise have been able to treat, but for their absence of a respiratory drive, or the inability to breathe on their own. 
 Patient groups that can be treated with High Velocity Therapy. These include patients suffering from a wide range of respiratory distress acuity levels, including most of those traditionally treated by NiPPV.
 

Instead of a mask, High Velocity Therapy technology delivers temperature-controlled humidified gas to the patient at a high velocity through a small-bore nasal interface. High Velocity Therapy is typically a de-escalation therapy, which means it is appropriate to start at higher flows. Breathing while on High Velocity Therapy technology helps patients ventilate and return to their normal breathing pattern. In comparison to NiPPV, we believe that our technology improves patient comfort and compliance due to the delivery of breathing gases through a small-bore nasal interface that does not completely cover the patient’s nose and mouth. While using our High Velocity Therapy products, patients can eat and drink, talk with their caregivers and loved ones, and in some cases where important to the patient’s rehabilitation, remain ambulatory. For parents with infants in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU, our products allow more direct skin-to-skin contact between parents 
 4


and their babies which has been shown to improve cardiorespiratory and temperature stability, sleep organization and duration of quiet sleep, neurodevelopmental outcomes, breastfeeding and modulation of pain responses in published clinical literature.

High Velocity Therapy Mechanism of Action
 The key to High Velocity Therapy technology is the ability to deliver conditioned breathing gases to patients in respiratory distress at a sufficient velocity to flush out the anatomical dead space between breaths when the patient’s respiratory rate is elevated. As patients inhale this properly humidified, oxygen rich and carbon dioxide depleted medical gas, the work of breathing is reduced. Similar to the effect seen with water flowing from a garden hose, narrowing of the opening leads to dramatic increases in water velocity and turbulent kinetic energy exiting the hose or, in the case of High Velocity Therapy technology, air exiting the cannula. The Precision Flow systems’ high-velocity delivery of breathing gases through a small-bore adult cannula results in an approximately four-fold increase in velocity as compared to the same flow from the large-bore adult cannula of conventional heated humidified high flow oxygen devices. This increased velocity promotes turbulent flush of the airway, even for patients breathing very rapidly.
 
The high velocity breathing gases delivered by Precision Flow systems both actively push the air out of the anatomical dead space through the mouth and nose and also replace air containing carbon dioxide from the lungs with freshly oxygenated air.
 Diagram depicting the ability of high velocity air to displace dead air in the nasal cavities and the back of the throat.
 

Increasing the flow rate of untreated air would typically present challenges to the upper airway structures which are responsible for both heating and humidifying the inhaled gas prior to reaching the lungs. The increased air flow has the potential to cause drying and damage to the mucosa, which in turn could lead to complications such as increased infection rates. Breathing gases provided by our High Velocity Therapy products are temperature controlled and humidified both for patient comfort as well as to protect the integrity of the airway. This is accomplished by a proprietary vapor transfer cartridge, or VTC, containing water-vapor-permeable hollow fibers that provide a high surface area allowing air to become saturated with water vapor at body temperature. The result is a very fine, molecular water vapor that is energetically stable.

An important factor in providing temperature-controlled humidified air to patients is ensuring that the intended temperature and humidity are maintained as the air travels from the device to the patient. Our High Velocity Therapy products accomplish this by using a proprietary triple-lumen water-jacketed delivery tube which maintains the air at a constant temperature throughout the length of the delivery tube. This design, coupled with the very fine, molecular water vapor generated by our proprietary VTC, is designed to prevent water from condensing in the delivery tube and to eliminate the risk of having liquid water introduced into the patient’s airway. Other conventional humidified high flow oxygen delivery device manufacturers create humidified breathing gases by heating a bulk volume of water to create steam, which is then transferred to patients through electrically heated concentric wires. This results in the breathing gases passing through areas of uneven heating, including areas of excess heat which could be dangerous to the patient as well as cooler areas where condensation, or rainout, occurs. Delivery of liquid water rainout into the nose of the patient is both uncomfortable and potentially harmful. The Precision Flow systems’ triple-lumen delivery tube has been shown in a study we sponsored to provide excellent control of rainout of condensation as compared to the humidified breathing gas systems with the heated wire.
 The oxygen content of the air and its flow rate can be precisely regulated by the Precision Flow systems using a simple, intuitive single-dial interface. Connections to air and oxygen are through standard wall connectors or via standard oxygen and air tanks typically available in hospitals. The Precision Flow systems make use of industry-standard, user-replaceable oxygen sensors to measure oxygen concentrations.
 Benefits of High Velocity Therapy 
 We believe our High Velocity Therapy technology addresses the key limitations of existing respiratory distress treatment options and provides the following principal benefits to hospitals, patients and providers:

• | Meaningful improvement in patient comfort and compliance. Our proprietary High Velocity Therapy technology is an innovative solution that provides non-invasive ventilatory support and enhances patient comfort and compliance when compared to NiPPV. According to a third-party clinical study published in the November 2007 issue of Respiratory Care, approximately 30% of patients are intolerant of NiPPV masks. The tight-fitting and difficult to seal masks can cause patient discomfort, anxiety and complicate the care required to support patients. In a Company-sponsored, randomized clinical trial, physicians reported a higher median score for High Velocity Therapy technology than NiPPV for patient comfort, ease of use, clinical response and need for monitoring, which we believe is due to properly conditioned medical gases being delivered through a small-bore nasal interface that does not completely cover the patient’s nose and mouth. While using our products, patients can eat and drink, talk with their caregivers and loved ones, take oral medications and may remain ambulatory. For parents with infants in the NICU, our product allows more direct skin-to-skin contact between the parents and their babies.

• | Reduced risk of pressure ventilation related side effects. In addition to improving overall patient comfort and ability to communicate, we believe our Precision Flow systems address other negative side effects caused by pressure ventilation and tight-fitting masks. These potential side effects include facial skin pressure ulcers, lung injury, claustrophobia, patient anxiety and risk of vomiting and aspiration.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Facilitation of patient admissions to lower intensity, lower cost and less capacity-constrained care settings. As we believe our Precision Flow systems are more easily tolerated by patients, the monitoring requirements may be lower, which may increase the likelihood that a patient can be admitted to a general care floor, step-down unit or discharged home from the ED. Patients who are placed on NiPPV in an ED are often admitted to an ICU. In comparison, in a multicenter utilization study we sponsored that included 128 patients with respiratory distress treated in emergency rooms with High Velocity Therapy technology, the physicians’ perception was that 54% of the patients could be transferred to general care floors as opposed to being admitted to the ICU. An independent third-party study published in the June 2005 issue of Critical Care Medicine determined the average cost for a typical three day stay in the ICU in the United States was $13,347. The cost increased by an average of 47% to $19,558 when the patient required mechanical ventilation. To the extent our products are able to reduce the number of patients requiring transfer to the ICU, these treatment costs can be reduced.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinician workflow benefits, including easier administration and reduced patient monitoring. As the patient monitoring requirements may be lower than NiPPV, our Precision Flow systems may improve clinician and hospital workflow. Additionally, unlike conventional humidified high flow oxygen delivery devices, our Precision Flow systems can be connected directly to standard nurse call systems found in most hospitals. Connecting to the nurse call systems allows the nursing staff to be immediately alerted to alarms indicating that the patient may not be obtaining optimal therapy.

systems can also be connected to an electronic medical record, or EMR, system to record the delivered flow rate, temperature, and percent oxygen. These accessories help reduce the time clinicians need to spend with a single patient and enable them to have more time to see other patients.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe we can replace NiPPV as the standard of care for treating respiratory distress patients who require non-invasive ventilatory support and who are capable of spontaneously breathing. The table below highlights the key advantages of High Velocity Therapy technology over NiPPV.

Overview and Benefits of our Oxygen Assist Module
 Our Oxygen Assist Module is a module designed for use with most versions of our Precision Flow systems, as well as our next generation HVT 2.0, and is designed to help clinicians maintain oxygen levels within a tight SpO2 range. The Oxygen Assist Module adjusts delivered FiO2 in response to SpO2 readings captured by a standard pulse oximetry probe. We launched our Oxygen Assist Module in the United Kingdom, select European markets, and Israel in late 2020 and are presently seeking FDA approval of this technology in the United States.
 We believe our Oxygen Assist Module has the potential to address the key limitations of utilizing manual control to maintain oxygen levels, particularly in neonates, within a tight SpO2 range, and provides the following principal benefits to hospitals, patients and providers:
  
• | Allows reliable realization of SpO2 target;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Assists staff in maintaining targeted SpO2 range, including during stress, movement and, with neonates, feeding;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | May allow nurses to spend more time with patients and parents and less time changing settings;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Allows for further evaluation of consequences of selected SpO2 targeted range, including clinical indications, outcomes, and workflow improvement; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Allows for the use of the Precision Flow system to provide respiratory support and its attendant benefits, including facilitation of cuddling and kangaroo care with neonates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Oxygen Assist Module is not an SpO2 monitor and does not eliminate the need for separate and independent patient monitoring. 
 Our Product Portfolio
 High Velocity Therapy Family
 We currently offer four versions of our Precision Flow systems: Precision Flow Hi-VNI, Precision Flow Plus, Precision Flow Classic and Precision Flow Heliox. Our Precision Flow systems include a capital unit, a single-use disposable and a nasal interface. The capital unit contains all the electronic components and the input gas controls that enable the delivery 
 7


of breathing gas at a precise level of oxygenation at flow rates, controlled by the operator, ranging from 1 to 40 liters per minute. All of our Precision Flow versions are integrated systems that provide precise user control of temperature, air flow and percentage oxygen through a simple one-button interface. Setup time, including warm-up time, for all of our Precision Flow versions is less than five minutes and alarms are incorporated into the system to alert the operator to disruption of respiratory support. All four versions are also mounted on a roll stand pole for easy transfer, use and visualization of the displayed settings. All four versions are easy to set up and require little support to operate beyond changing sterile inhalation water bags as needed.
 The Precision Flow Hi-VNI system was fully launched in February 2019. When compared to the Precision Flow Plus, which was launched in April 2017, the Precision Flow Hi-VNI system includes incremental hardware and software updates to improve the reliability and ease of manufacture and to comply with the Electromagnetic Compatibility or EMC 4th Edition requirements for medical devices. The primary change was to limit the maximum temperature to 39 degrees Celsius. As with the Precision Flow Plus, the Precision Flow Hi-VNI system offers connectivity to a hospital’s nurse call system to alert the staff to disruption of the patient’s respiratory support and/or to most hospitals’ EMR systems to record the user selected and current delivered flow rate, temperature, percent oxygen, and the status of the supply gas connections and water supply as well as any fault codes.
 The Precision Flow Heliox also includes the same High Velocity Therapy technology as the other Precision Flow versions and is also able to precisely deliver heliox gas. 
 We received 510k clearance of our next generation HVT 2.0 High Velocity Therapy system from the FDA in 2021 and began a limited market release of this system in early 2022. The HVT 2.0 represents the next generation of High Velocity Therapy. The system retains the core competencies of the current Precision Flow platform and, with an internal blower, is designed to eliminate the need for wall air. With a variable oxygen connection (tank, wall or concentrator) the HVT 2.0 system is designed to support patients wherever they need respiratory support, including outside of the hospital in a home or future use in a field transport setting. A large intuitive display with touchscreen operation, on screen troubleshooting guidance, and a fully assembled disposable are intended to minimize clinician time spent on operating the equipment so they can focus on their patient. 
 The single-use, disposable component of our Precision Flow systems has two parts: (1) the disposable patient circuit, or DPC, which includes all of the components that generate the temperature-controlled humidified breathing gas, including the VTC and (2) the triple-lumen delivery tube which ensures the heated, humidified gas is delivered from the DPC to the patient at constant temperature and humidification level. We also sell a series of small-bore nasal interfaces and adapters. The interfaces we offer come in a variety of sizes, ranging from premature infants to adults, allowing clinicians to select an interface that blocks less than half of the external opening of each nostril, thereby maximizing the technology’s ability to flush the anatomical dead space.
 
Companion Products and Enhancements
 We sell companion products that facilitate clinical use and enable rapidly growing market acceptance and expansion. These products include (i) the Vapotherm Transfer Unit 2.0, which allows patients to be transferred between care areas within the hospital or ambulate while on therapy, (ii) the Q50 compressor, which provides a compact, relatively low noise, low cost source of compressed air necessary to run the Precision Flow systems in areas of the hospital without access to a wall gas source, (iii) the aerosol aeroneb adaptor, which is designed to facilitate delivery of ultrasonic aerosolized medication, (iv) an aerosol disposable patient circuit that is designed to streamline both continuous and intermittent delivery of aerosol medication for patients on High Velocity Therapy, and (v) a tracheostomy adaptor that simplifies the connection of the Precision Flow systems to a tracheostomy collar used to wean patients off mechanical ventilation. Specialized disposable products also enable the delivery of specialized nitric oxide and heliox breathing gases. We also sell a new lightweight ProSoft cannula that is designed to provide gentle contact with the skin.
 In addition, we have product enhancement projects ongoing at any point in time. These enhancements incorporate customer feedback with the goal of improving the patient and caregiver experience.
 Market Expanding Products
 We are in the process of seeking FDA approval of our Oxygen Assist Module and have obtained an investigational device exemption for pediatric evaluation of the Oxygen Assist Module. On April 2, 2020, the Oxygen Assist Module was granted Breakthrough Device Designation by the FDA for on-demand titration of oxygen into warm humidified breathing gases delivered to spontaneously breathing patients based on continuous non-invasive monitoring of pulse oxygen saturation.

FDA’s Breakthrough Device Program is intended to help patients and healthcare providers receive more timely access to breakthrough technologies that may have the potential to provide more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. The program is designed to expedite the development, assessment and FDA review of breakthrough technologies. 
 
On February 12, 2021, the FDA notified us that, under FDA Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) issued on March 24, 2020, the HVT 2.0 was authorized for emergency use in healthcare settings to treat patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the conditions set forth in the EUA.
 Clinical Results and Studies and Economic Data
 We have a compelling body of clinical studies and economic data that supports the use of High Velocity Therapy technology for treating respiratory distress and providing non-invasive ventilatory support. Maintaining an ongoing cadence of clinical study and economic data publications is an important component of our strategy, including both Vapotherm-sponsored research and providing grants for investigator-initiated research.
High Velocity Therapy Compared to NiPPV
 A significant body of clinical studies across multiple spontaneously-breathing patient populations has validated High Velocity Therapy technology as a safe and effective alternative to NiPPV. Additionally, High Velocity Therapy affects ventilatory support through a process called high-velocity nasal insufflation. In the adult population, we sponsored a 204 patient (100 NiPPV patients and 104 High Velocity Therapy technology patients), multisite randomized controlled trial in the ED, which was published in the July 2018 issue of Annals of Emergency Medicine. Patients in respiratory distress were recruited with the need for non-invasive ventilatory support in the ED. Of the patients who were enrolled in the study, 65 were suffering from respiratory failure due to COPD including hypercapnia, the inability to effectively clear carbon dioxide from the body. The primary outcome measure was therapy failure requiring intubation, the insertion of a plastic tube into the trachea to maintain an open airway for mechanical ventilation, within 72 hours of initiation or a clinical decision to cross-over to the alternative therapy. This study concluded that high velocity nasal insufflation delivered with High Velocity Therapy technology is non-inferior to NiPPV in preventing patients from being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
 
Patients were recruited with the need for non-invasive ventilatory support and followed for 72 hours. The primary outcome measure was respiratory failure requiring intubation within 72 hours of initiation or clinical decision to cross-over to the alternative therapy. The outcome showed High Velocity Therapy technology was non-inferior to NiPPV. The following chart conveys the rates of failure resulting in intubation for those randomized to High Velocity Therapy technology and NiPPV. There was no statistically significant difference between the two.

Secondary outcomes included monitoring of vital signs, oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, and patient reports of their perception of shortness of breath were monitored during the first four hours of therapy, and High Velocity Therapy technology performed as well as NiPPV during this period. The important measure of the effect of the therapy on providing ventilatory support is blood carbon dioxide and how that changes over time. Elevated blood carbon dioxide levels will generally decline over time when a patient receives adequate ventilatory support. Use of both High Velocity Therapy technology and NiPPV led to similar decreases in carbon dioxide levels within the blood.
 
The chart below demonstrates the changes observed in blood gas values for both High Velocity Therapy technology and NiPPV therapy. Both begin at baseline with elevated carbon dioxide values, and both drop at a similar rate over time, at one hour and four hours of therapy.

The clinicians involved in the trial were asked for their perception of the various therapies. The clinicians reported a higher median score for High Velocity Therapy technology than NiPPV for patient comfort, ease of use, clinical response and need for monitoring. The clinicians reported the same median score for High Velocity Therapy technology and NiPPV for technical/clinical complexity. The authors also concluded that patients treated with High Velocity Therapy technology can more easily communicate, receive oral medications, and eat without interruption of therapy, which are limitations of NiPPV.

In February 2018, the NEJM Journal Watch, which reviews and summarizes medical research studies across 12 specialties, concluded after reviewing our Company-sponsored ED study described above that High Velocity Therapy technology is easier to set up than NiPPV. Further, the NEJM Journal Watch noted that High Velocity Therapy technology has the potential to replace NiPPV in EDs, ICUs and ambulances.
 A subgroup analysis of these data was published in Heart and Lung in April 2020 looking at the effectiveness of High Velocity Therapy technology specifically in the 65 patients among the 204 in this study that were diagnosed with significant hypercapnia. The ability of High Velocity Therapy technology to adequately provide ventilatory support is particularly important in this population. This subgroup analysis showed that 6% of the High Velocity Therapy technology patients and 16% of the NiPPV patients required intubation within the first 72 hours of care after admission, with comparable ability to reduce carbon dioxide levels over time. The subgroup analysis concluded that High Velocity Therapy technology provided ventilatory support similar to NiPPV in patients presenting with hypercapnic respiratory distress. Another sub-group analysis of these data was published in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine in April 2020 looking at the effectiveness of High Velocity Therapy technology specifically in the 42 patients from the primary ED study who presented with decompensated heart failure. This subgroup analysis demonstrated comparable results between High Velocity Therapy technology and NiPPV. The results from these subgroup analyses may be valued by ED physicians who need to make treatment decisions before knowing the patient diagnosis. 
 High Velocity Therapy technology was also observed in a third-party study published in the May 2013 issue of the Journal of Pediatrics to have similar efficacy when compared to nCPAP in a randomized controlled trial of premature infants who were receiving non-invasive ventilatory support after being removed from intubation, or extubation. nCPAP is the standard non-invasive therapy for management of respiratory distress in neonates in the NICU. nCPAP is administered using a tight-fitting nasal plugging cannula and delivers pressure to the lungs. It is efficacious, but it is also associated with trauma to the face of the baby, pressure and volume-related complications to the chest, and limitation of access to both parents and caregivers to maintain close contact with the newborns. High Velocity Therapy technology produced similar rates of extubation failure as the standard of care nCPAP, and significantly reduced nasal trauma.
 Additionally, High Velocity Therapy technology was observed in a third-party study published in the May 2016 issue of JAMA Pediatrics to be non-inferior to NiPPV as a primary respiratory support therapy in a randomized controlled clinical trial of premature newborn infants with respiratory distress syndrome. In this trial, 316 infants were randomized to High Velocity Therapy technology or NiPPV. The primary outcome of the trial was the number of patients who required intubation and mechanical ventilation within 72 hours, and there was no significant difference seen between High Velocity 
 11


Therapy technology and NiPPV. No significant differences in other measures such as the length of time on respiratory therapy, infection rates or other prematurity-associated complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a disease in newborns caused by destruction of lung tissue, were reported.
 The results from an independent clinical trial of High Velocity Therapy technology versus NiPPV in 76 preterm infants published in the May 2015 issue of Pediatric Pulmonology similarly suggest that High Velocity Therapy technology is non-inferior to NiPPV. These trials support the use of High Velocity Therapy technology as an alternative to nCPAP and NiPPV for primary and post-extubation support of neonates in respiratory distress. 
 
Economic Cost Savings Data
 An independent third-party study published in the June 2005 issue of Critical Care Medicine determined the average cost for a typical three day stay in the ICU in the United States is $13,347. The cost increased by an average of 47% to $19,558 when the patient required mechanical ventilation. To the extent our products are able to reduce the number of patients requiring transfer to the ICU, these treatment costs can be reduced. Treatment of patients with High Velocity Therapy technology can impact admission and placement of patients due to the lower complexity of High Velocity Therapy technology as compared to NiPPV. This is dependent on the individual sites, which often require admission to the high cost and resource-constrained ICUs if NiPPV is initiated on the patient. In a multicenter utilization study we sponsored, published in the Winter 2015 issue of Respiratory Therapy, of the 128 patients with respiratory distress treated in emergency rooms with High Velocity Therapy technology, treating physicians perceived that 54% of patients could be admitted to the general care floor, as opposed to the ICU. This finding is exemplified by a single-patient case study report from Athens Regional Medical Center. In this report, a patient with end-stage COPD who was well-known to that facility had recently been discharged from the hospital following a three day stay in the ICU where the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Upon a subsequent arrival in the ED with severe difficulty breathing, this patient was treated using High Velocity Therapy technology and within 44 minutes her respiratory rate had decreased from 36 to 20 breaths per minute. Blood measurements later confirmed a normalization of pH, reduction in carbon dioxide, and maintenance of oxygenated levels of hemoglobin. The patient was kept overnight and discharged the following day. We believe the less intensive nature of the High Velocity Therapy technology permitted the physician to direct the patient to the general care floor, rather than the ICU, in this situation resulting in a savings of an estimated $3,750 for this hospital (estimated $4,500 cost for a three day stay in the ICU versus an estimated $750 cost for a one day stay on the general care floor).
 Additionally, patients who are intolerant of NiPPV devices are often sedated and potentially intubated and escalated to mechanical ventilation, an invasive procedure that often results in increased care costs, increased lengths of stay, ventilator dependence, and increased morbidity and mortality. Because patients who are placed on High Velocity Therapy technology are no more likely to fail to intubation than NiPPV patients and High Velocity Therapy technology may be more easily tolerated, its utilization has the ability to reduce the number of NiPPV intolerant patients who otherwise would have been intubated. Therefore, in addition to increased patient benefits due to potentially avoiding intubation for patients who are intolerant of the masks associated with NiPPV, there may be substantial savings to the healthcare system for each patient that can be successfully treated with High Velocity Therapy technology.
 Studies have shown that reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation days is an important element in reducing the potential for ventilator-associated consequences, including pneumonia, a life-threatening complication associated with mechanical ventilation. One role LTACHs play is to help wean patients from their dependence on mechanical ventilation. Gaylord Hospital, a LTACH, presented at the 2017 National Association of Long Term Hospital conference that their adoption of High Velocity Therapy technology helped them achieve an average reduction of four days of mechanical ventilation per patient, yielding an annual average cost savings for that facility of $394,000 between 2012 and 2015.
 Oxygen Assist Module Prototype Study
 Our Oxygen Assist Module helps clinicians maintain oxygen levels within a target range by simplifying and automating adjustments to most versions of our Precision Flow systems’ delivery of oxygenated breathing gases. The adjustments are based on the module’s continuous readings of a patient’s oxygen from a standard pulse oximetry probe. In November 2018, the Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal & Neonatal edition published the results of our sponsored prospective, two-center, order-randomized cross-over study performed at two NICUs in the United Kingdom, designed to evaluate the performance of a prototype of our Oxygen Assist Module technology as a module to our Precision Flow Plus system. The Oxygen Assist Module is referred to in the study as the IntellO2.
 The target SpO2 range set in this study was 90-95% in preterm babies being supported by High Velocity Therapy technology. Babies were randomized to receive 24 hours of either manual control or automatic control using the Oxygen Assist Module. After the first 24 hours, the babies were crossed over to the alternative therapy for another 24 hours. The primary 
 12


outcome measure was percent of time spent within the target SpO2 range. Secondary outcomes included the overall proportion and durations of SpO2 within specified hyperoxemic and hypoxemic ranges, and the characteristics of the times within and outside SpO2 target range. Data were analyzed from 30 preterm infants with median gestation at birth of 26 (24–27) weeks, age during the study of 29 (18–53) days and study weight 1080 (959–1443) g.
 When using the Oxygen Assist Module, clinician performance in maintaining SpO2 within the target SpO2 range was significantly greater proportion of the time than during manual control alone, while at the same time requiring significantly fewer manual adjustments to the equipment. The median target SpO2 range was achieved 80% of the time on automated (Oxygen Assist Module) control compared with 49% under manual control. In addition to the greater proportion of time in the target range, there were also fewer episodes of transient severe hypoxemia (defined as SpO2 below 80% lasting at least 60 seconds) under automated control compared with manual control. There were no differences in the number of episodes per hour of SpO2 above 98% between the study arms, but the average episode duration and the total percentage of time spent above the SpO2 target range was significantly lower under Oxygen Assist Module automated control as compared to manual control.
 
The chart below depicts a composite SpO2 histogram of all patient data (n=30) with paired bars as automated control (white) and manual control (black). The frequency of SpO2 values denotes the proportion of total time (%) spent at each SpO2, with aggregated SpO2 values <80%. The target SpO2 range for babies receiving oxygen (90%–95%) is illustrated in the blue outlines. The chart is based on graphic found in the aforementioned November 2018 edition of the Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal & Neonatal edition. 
 


We are currently enrolling patients in a pediatric evaluation of the Oxygen Assist Module pursuant to an Investigational Device Exemption received from the FDA.

We have structured our sales and clinical support team with specialized roles to sell our Precision Flow systems and single-use disposables, while delivering customer support and medical education on an ongoing basis. Our field sales representatives are responsible for identifying key customer prospects, educating them on the value of our High Velocity Therapy technology, gaining their commitment for acquiring and utilizing our capital units and introducing our clinical educators.
 Our clinical educators enhance the experience for customers and help facilitate adoption and utilization. We established a medical education department that develops and delivers physician-to-physician, Company-sponsored education events, and sponsors continuing medical education programs focused on addressing respiratory distress.
 Our customer service and technical support team is responsible for addressing maintenance, repairs and general product and technical questions to help ensure uninterrupted patient treatments. We also use an inbound digital marketing campaign to drive leads and accelerate sales. We leverage the internet, social media, and email channels to increase brand awareness and educate customers. For example, during 2020 and 2021 we were able to utilize our online Vapotherm Academy to train more than 37,000 caregivers on High Velocity Therapy technology, which proved critical during the COVID-19 pandemic when we were not able to directly access many hospitals in the United States, United Kingdom, and around the world. Data and analytics drive our decision making and help us hone our messaging and strategies. Educated and interested potential customers convert to sales prospects on our website and all leads integrate with our CRM system.
 Commercial Activities Outside of the United States
 We conduct our international business in the United Kingdom and Germany through a direct sales organization which, in the United Kingdom, is operated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Solus Medical Limited (“Solus Medical”). We conduct our remaining international business through a distributor model, partnering with 50 distributors in 54 countries around the world. We focus our efforts on our most established and fastest growing markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy and Japan. We have directly employed or retained through professional employment organizations 48 individuals to support our distributors in several of these key markets. Additionally, in the United Kingdom, our subsidiary Solus Medical now has 13 full time commercial employees. As in the United States, our direct sales teams in the United Kingdom and Germany and our distributors around the world work to grow the sales of our disposable products by increasing the utilization and installed base of our Precision Flow Systems. Our international sales and marketing efforts also encompass marketing of our Oxygen Assist Module in select countries. Our direct sales teams in the United Kingdom and Germany and our distributors around the world work to offer different options to our customers for acquiring Precision Flow capital units and Oxygen Assist Modules as appropriate on a country by country basis, ranging from the purchase of the Precision Flow capital units with payment in full at the time of purchase, to financed purchases of the Precision Flow capital units, to bundled discounts involving the placement of Precision Flow capital units for use by the customer at no upfront charge in connection with the customer’s ongoing purchase of disposable products. We offer the Oxygen Assist Module in select international markets on both sales and time-based subscription models. We leverage our digital marketing platform abroad to educate our international clinicians, focusing primarily in the United Kingdom. We continue to evaluate market opportunities outside of the United States for business expansion.
Reimbursement
 Payment for patient care in the United States is generally made by third-party payors, including private insurers and government healthcare programs. The reimbursement from third-party payors for patients that require High Velocity Therapy technology is typically intended to cover the overall cost of treatment, including the cost of our devices used during the procedure as well as the overhead cost associated with the facility where the procedure is performed. We do not directly bill any third-party payors and receive payment from the hospital or providers for our devices or services. RespirCare, the pulmonary medical practice with which we have affiliated, typically does bill third party payors in the ordinary course of its business.
 
Reimbursement for hospital services, including the cost of our devices, during an inpatient stay generally is made by the payor directly to the healthcare provider under a prospective payment system that is determined by a classification system known as Diagnosis Related Groups, or DRGs. A DRG is a statistical system of classifying any inpatient stay into groups for the purposes of payment using a number of factors including, among other things, the principal diagnosis, major procedures, discharge status, patient age and complicating secondary diagnoses. DRGs are used in both acute and chronic care settings and employed by both private insurers and government payors. Rather than paying the hospital or provider for what it spent caring for a patient, payors pay a fixed amount based on the patient’s DRG. Similar reimbursement methodologies that bundle the cost of our devices into a provider’s payment also exist for services provided to patients in the ED and out-patient settings. 
 14



Reimbursement for physician and clinical staff services provided in connection with Vapotherm Access is generally made by the payor directly to the healthcare provider based on applicable Current Procedural Terminology reimbursement codes, or CPT codes. There are presently five CPT codes that may describe professional services provided in conjunction with Vapotherm Access services. Coding guidelines from the American Medical Association and third-party payors govern when an applicable CPT code may be provided to report such services for reimbursement. 
 
Research and Development
 Maintaining a strong cadence of new product introductions is an integral part of our strategy. We launched our Oxygen Assist Module in the United Kingdom, select European markets, and Israel in late 2020 and are presently seeking FDA approval of this technology in the United States. We previously entered into an agreement with a third party for a perpetual, exclusive, world-wide license to certain intellectual property related to the Oxygen Assist Module for the delivery of non-invasive ventilatory support. Pursuant to the agreement, we began paying a royalty starting on the date of the first commercial sale of the Oxygen Assist Module, and continuing for a ten year term equal to 10% of the first $3.0 million of Oxygen Assist Module revenue, 5% of the next $6.0 million of Oxygen Assist Module revenue, and 2% of any additional Oxygen Assist Module revenue until the end of the ten year term. We also license the pulse oximetry technology utilized with the Oxygen Assist Module from other manufacturers. Finally, HGE has a license agreement with Temple University under which HGE is required to pay a 1% royalty on all HGE commercial sales of HGE service offerings relating to the clinical management of and data regarding patients with COPD. The license agreement will remain in effect until the last to occur of the following (i) August 1, 2022, (ii) the expiration of the life of the last to expire of the licensed patents, and (iii) a complete cessation of reasonable efforts on the part of HGE to sell, service, or otherwise derive revenue from any licensed product. 
Competition
 The medical device industry is subject to rapid change from the introduction of new products and technologies and other activities of industry participants. We compete as a clinically validated alternative to NiPPV for treatment of patients who are suffering from respiratory distress.
 As our products are capable of treating respiratory distress, including those suffering from low oxygen levels, as well as those who have historically required NiPPV because they were unable to flush retained carbon dioxide from their respiratory system, we consider our primary competition to be NiPPV manufacturers, including Philips Respironics. We also compete on a secondary basis with manufacturers of conventional heated humidified high flow oxygen delivery products, such as Fisher & Paykel Healthcare.
 We believe that the primary competitive factors in the respiratory distress market are:
  
• | product efficacy and ability to prevent intubation;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | product safety, reliability and durability;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | product ease of use and patient comfort;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | quality and volume of clinical evidence;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | product support and service;
--+-----------------------------


• | pricing and revenue strategies;
--+--------------------------------


• | technological innovation;
--+--------------------------


• | effective marketing to and education of clinicians;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | sales force experience and access; and
--+---------------------------------------


• | Company, product and brand recognition.
--+----------------------------------------

 Other companies that offer treatments for respiratory distress against which we compete are larger businesses that have greater resources than we do. NiPPV is an established proven therapy and is currently better known to physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists, and it is currently considered the standard of care for treating patients with respiratory distress. However, we believe clinician awareness of High Velocity Therapy technology is increasing, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. HGE competes in the technology enabled services and digital health industries, where some of its competitors include Livongo Health Inc., Vivify Health Inc., Propeller Health Inc., Conversa and Spire Health Inc.

Intellectual Property Portfolio
 As of December 31, 2021, we held more than 165 issued patents and more than 95 patent applications, totaling an active patent portfolio of over 260 filings granted or pending, with expiration dates ranging from April 2022 through August 2039. These filings can be organized into four main categories representing our patent portfolio: Precision Flow, next generation system filings, Flow Rest, and various accessory technologies. In the United States, we hold 14 issued patents for the Precision Flow family, 11 for the Flow Rest family (a legacy device), nine for the accessories (including the Oxygen Assist Module), and five for our next generation technology. The Precision Flow patents are expected to expire between December 2022 and March 2033, the Flow Rest patents are expected to expire between November 2026 and December 2038, and the accessories patents are expected to expire between December 2031 and August 2038, with the next generation patents expected to expire between November 2033 and August 2039. Additionally, we have eight pending U.S. patent applications directed to our next generation technologies, two pending U.S. patent applications directed to our Precision Flow systems technology, one pending U.S. patent application directed to our Flow Rest technology and 13 pending U.S. patent applications directed to accessories for the aforementioned technologies (including the Oxygen Assist Module). We maintain a strategic international patent portfolio primarily in the European Union, Australia, Japan and China, with other counties pursued in select circumstances. Since 2016, we have maintained and executed on deliberate innovation areas designed to sustain the continued growth of our patent portfolio to protect our proprietary technology from competitor use.
 As of December 31, 2021, we have at least 14 trademark registrations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, at least 19 trademarks applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, at least 13 trademarks with common law rights, and a wide range of international protection of its trademarks with a focus of increasing brand awareness and market penetration globally.
 Manufacturing and Supply
  We manage all aspects of product supply through our operations team based in Exeter, New Hampshire. We manufacture certain components of our Precision Flow systems in-house, but primarily rely on third-party suppliers to source the majority of Precision Flow components. We outsource all of the manufacturing of our Oxygen Assist Module. Outsourcing manufacturing of both components or finished goods, as applicable, reduces our need for capital investment and provides expertise and the capacity necessary to meet demand for our Precision Flow systems and Oxygen Assist Module. During 2021, we continued to make improvements and adjustments to our production capacity in response to high demand for our products and labor shortages, including engaging a third-party manufacturer to assemble certain of our products at its facility in Tijuana, Mexico and hiring a significant number of temporary production workers. We assess, qualify and select our suppliers with a view towards ensuring that our High Velocity Therapy systems and Oxygen Assist Module, and their components are safe and effective, adhere to all applicable regulations, are of the highest quality, and meet our supply needs. Our quality assurance process monitors and maintains supplier performance through qualification and periodic supplier reviews and audits against the requirements of the FDA, the International Organization for Standardization and our own policies and procedures.
 Certain components used in our High Velocity Therapy systems, and in the case of our Oxygen Assist Module, the finished good itself, are supplied by single source suppliers. Our suppliers manufacture the components they produce for us and test our components and devices to our specifications. We intend to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to enable us to continue our operations while we obtain another supplier if one or more of our single source suppliers were to encounter a delay in supply or end supply.
 Government Regulation
 Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) and other countries in which we conduct business. Our products are subject to regulation in the United States as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
 16


In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to a variety of regulations in the EEA governing clinical trials and the commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we have or are required to obtain FDA clearance or approval for a product, we will be required to obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials and to obtain marketing authorization or approval of our products under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials or commercialize our products in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval.
 FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, granting of a de novo request, or approval of an application for premarket approval, or PMA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of regulatory controls needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance.
The 510(k) Process
 Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or another commercially available device that was cleared through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 After a 510(k) premarket notification is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process.
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated under the FDCA as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
 After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo grant or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) (or a PMA) in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a manufacturer documenting the change in an internal letter-to-file. The FDA can review these letters to file during an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) clearance, de novo grant or PMA approval is obtained. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 17


De Novo Classification
 Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified under the FDCA into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, a medical device could be eligible for de novo classification only if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the request if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) notification, determines that the device is not low to moderate risk, or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. After a device receives de novo classification, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, another de novo petition or even PMA approval.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
 In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the study and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is allowed to go into effect by the FDA and the study approved by the reviewing IRB(s), human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of subjects as set forth in the study protocol. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate review from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and allowed to go into effect by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
 During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.

 Regulation of Medical Devices in the EEA
 There is currently no premarket government review of medical devices in the EEA. However, all medical devices placed on the market in the EEA must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I of Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, or the Medical Devices Directive. The most fundamental essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment, and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter. Compliance with a standard developed to implement an essential requirement also creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
 To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body. Notified bodies are often separate entities and are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by government authorities. The notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EEA. Once the product has been placed on the market in the EEA, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the medical device.
 In order to demonstrate safety and efficacy for their medical devices, manufacturers must conduct clinical investigations in accordance with the requirements of Annex X to the Medical Devices Directive, and applicable European and International Organization for Standardization standards, as implemented or adopted in the EEA member states. Clinical trials for medical devices usually require the approval of an ethics review board and approval by or notification to the national regulatory authorities. Both regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of serious adverse event reports during a study and may request a copy of the final study report.
 On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member States, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them, in all EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
 The Medical Devices Regulation took effect on May 26, 2021. The new regulations among other things:
  
• | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20


 
• | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the European Union; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of:
  
• | design, development, manufacturing and testing;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | product standards;
--+-------------------


• | product safety;
--+----------------


• | product safety reporting;
--+--------------------------


• | marketing, sales and distribution;
--+-----------------------------------


• | packaging and storage requirements;
--+------------------------------------


• | labeling requirements;
--+-----------------------


• | content and language of instructions for use;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | clinical trials;
--+-----------------


• | record keeping procedures;
--+---------------------------


• | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


• | recalls and field corrective actions;
--+--------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | import and export restrictions;
--+--------------------------------


• | tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | registration for reimbursement; and
--+------------------------------------


• | necessity of testing performed in country by distributors for licensees.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
 Regulation of Medical Devices in China
 Depending on the product risk level, each imported medical device commercially marketed and distributed in China requires a notification to or a registration with China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”, formerly known as CFDA). Under the current Chinese Medical Device Regulation (State Council Order. #680, effective since 2017), medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III. Class I includes devices with lowest risks to patients, whose safety and effectiveness can be assured by general risk control mechanisms. Class I devices can be marketed in China through a notification to the NMPA. Class II includes devices with medium risks to patients and are under special control of the NMPA. Class III devices are those with high risks to patients, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and are under the most stringent regulatory control. Both Class II and Class III devices require a registration with the NMPA.
 We initiated a product registration process in China for our Precision Flow systems, VTU and nasal interfaces in 2021. Our Precision Flow systems, VTU and nasal interfaces, which provide ventilatory support to neonatal and pediatric patients, as well as patients in EDs, ICUs, general care floors and LTACHs, are likely to be classified as Class II or Class III devices in China, subject to the NMPA’s classification designation.
 Before registering an imported Class II or Class III medical device with the NMPA, manufacturers are required to prepare the Product Technical Requirements (PTRs) that consist of performance specifications and testing methods specific to their products and in compliance with applicable Chinese device standards. Manufacturers must engage a NMPA-accredited laboratory to conduct an in-country type testing against the PTRs and applicable Chinese device standards. A type testing 
 21


process typically takes 3-6 months or longer. Under the current medical device regulations, imported medical devices must first be approved for marketing in their country of origin. Manufacturers are obligated to provide the appropriate documents (e.g. CE Mark, 510(k) letter, approved Premarket Approval Application) showing that the device has been approved for marketing in a country where the manufacturer is incorporated or the manufacturing site resides. 
 All of imported Class II and III devices are required to conduct local clinical trials in China unless (i) they are exempted from clinical trials under the Clinical Trial Exemption List published by the NMPA from time to time, (ii) manufacturers can demonstrate “substantial equivalence” to a predicate device currently on the market, or (iii) if there are overseas clinical study data or real world evidence that can prove product safety and effectiveness in Chinese patient populations. Clinical trials for some particular high risk devices are mandatory and need approval from the NMPA in advance. Clinical trials for other devices require a pre-notification to the NMPA. All registration trials must be approved by and conducted under the oversight of an Institutional Review Board, or Ethics Committee.
 The NMPA, after receiving an application for registration, will have the Center for Medical Device Evaluation (“CMDE”) review the application dossier and notify the applicant whether the application for registration is approved. The CMDE may require applicants to submit supplemental information (including clinical data and technical data) for its review. Applicants will be given 1 year to prepare and submit the required information. The CMDE’s statutory time limit for technical review is 60 working days for Class II devices and 90 working days for Class III devices. Subject to specifics of a product, an approval process could take longer, and clearance is never guaranteed. Fast track or priority review pathways can be available for devices that are innovative, address urgent unmet clinical needs, or have significant clinical value.
 After a device is approved by the NMPA for marketing, numerous and extensive regulatory requirements will apply post marketing authorization. These include but are not limited to:
 
 
• | Completion of any post-approval studies that may be required by the NMPA upon its conditional approval; Renewal of the registration with the NMPA every 5 years since the initial registration;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | GMP compliance requirements, which require foreign manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures during all stages of the manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Labeling, advertising and promotion requirements, which require that claims are truthful, non-misleading, and substantiated. Instructions for use should be clear to guide correct use of the products, and manufacturers are prohibited from unapproved or “off-label” uses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medical device adverse event monitoring, reporting and re-evaluation obligations, which require a manufacturer to report to the NMPA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury, would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury, if malfunction were to recur; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medical device recall obligations, which require that manufacturers to report to the NMPA any field corrections and product removals that are undertaken to reduce an unreasonable risk to health posed by the device or to remediate a violation of any applicable Chinese device standards, PTRs, or any applicable regulatory requirements that may present an unreasonable risk; the NMPA also has the authority to order a manufacturer to recall its product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will be subject to regular or fly-in inspections and market surveillance by the NMPA and its local counterparts to ensure continuous compliance with regulatory requirements. If the NMPA determines that we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
 
 
• | warning letters, corrective actions, fines;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | recalls, detention or seizure of our products, confiscation of illegal revenues;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | import alerts and bans;
--+------------------------


• | refusing to accept any future applications within a specific period of time;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing any NMPA approvals that have already been granted; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Debarment of responsible persons from engaging in medical device-related business activities within a specific period of time.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


The Chinese State Council passed new Medical Device Regulations, which replaced the previous Medical Device Regulations, effective June 1, 2021. The new Medical Device Regulations echo various regulatory reform initiatives unveiled by the NMPA in recent years with an aim to create a regulatory system that is conducive to device innovation. The new Medical Device Regulations reinforce post-approval compliance obligations and expect medical device marketing authorization holders to take primary responsibility for pre- and post-approval compliance. Additionally, the new Medical Device Regulations significantly increase penalties for all kinds of illegal actions, and introduce a dual penalty system, subjecting both companies and individual responsible persons to sanctions. This legislative development may result in the acceleration or delay of certain regulatory clearance or approval for our products in China.
 Pricing, Contracting and Reimbursement
 We believe our products are priced consistent with their value. In order to obtain or maintain business in the competitive respiratory therapy market, however, we have historically had to offer various discounts directly to purchasers or indirectly to purchasers through group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) or integrated delivery networks (“IDNs”), in accordance with applicable law. We have recently expanded the use of product discount offerings related to placed capital arrangements for our Precision Flow systems. Such bundled discount offerings involve the placement of capital equipment for use by the customer at no upfront charge in connection with the customer’s ongoing purchase of disposable products. In addition, consistent with an increasing emphasis in the medical device and broader healthcare industry on payment based on value (so-called value-based pricing), we may enter into contracts with customers that guarantee performance of our Precision Flow systems by refunding costs of disposables (or providing replacement disposables) used on patients if treatment does not achieve specific patient outcomes. In response to pressure from competition or customers, we may have to offer enhanced discounts or enter into additional value-based contracting arrangements, which may adversely affect our revenue.
 Health insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement of our products (or services provided using our products) is critical to the success of our business. Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products (or services provided using our products) will be covered and adequately reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government-sponsored health programs and private health plans.
 Our products are used in providing services and are often reimbursed by third-party payors as part of a global payment that covers all costs associated with providing that service. Healthcare providers that use our products may therefore be responsible for costs incurred in providing the service that exceed reimbursement. If our products are priced higher than competitor products, including products used to provide alternative treatments, and we are unable to demonstrate that our products are nonetheless cost-effective, we may encounter obstacles in obtaining or maintaining business.
 Third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for clinical products and services. Within the United States and abroad, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments. Limits on reimbursement available from governmental or private third-party payors may reduce the demand for, or negatively affect the price of those products, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse and Physician Payment Transparency Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, U.S. and foreign laws intended to prohibit or otherwise regulate activities that might result in fraud and abuse.
 U.S. federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws generally apply to our activities because our products are covered under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid or, in some instances, private insurance. The principal U.S. federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws applicable to us and our activities include: (1) the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the knowing and willful offer, solicitation, payment or receipt of anything of value for patient referrals or the generation of business reimbursable by a federal health care program; (2) the False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally-funded healthcare program, including claims resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute; and (3) healthcare fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payor. There are also similar state anti-kickback and false claims laws that apply to activities involving state-funded Medicaid and other healthcare programs as well as private third-party payors.
 The Anti-Kickback Statute is particularly relevant because of its broad applicability. Specifically, the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing anything of value, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Courts have interpreted the law to provide that a financial arrangement may violate this 
 23


law if any one of the purposes of an arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. Statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protect certain interactions if specific requirements are met. Failure to satisfy an exception or safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the Anti-Kickback Statute is violated; rather, the government will consider relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether the requisite intent for a violation is present and whether there is a low risk of fraud, waste, or abuse. Many interactions in which we commonly engage, such as the provision of business meals to healthcare practitioners, could implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute and are not protected by an exception or safe harbor. If the government determines that these activities are abusive, we could be subject to enforcement action. Penalties for Anti-Kickback Statute violations may include both criminal penalties such as imprisonment and civil sanctions such as fines and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs. Exclusion would mean that our products were no longer eligible for reimbursement under federal healthcare programs.
 Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit and monitor financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers; require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to comply with voluntary compliance standards issued by industry associations and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”).
 The healthcare laws and regulations applicable to us, including those described above, contain ambiguous requirements and are subject to evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. Manufacturers must adopt reasonable interpretations of requirements if there is ambiguity and those interpretations could be challenged. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil financial penalties, including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by government payors. Any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and healthcare goods and services could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and cash flows.
 To help ensure compliance with healthcare laws and regulations applicable to us, we have implemented a comprehensive compliance program based on the HHS Office of Inspector General’s Seven Fundamental Elements of an Effective Compliance Program. We adhere to, and the compliance program incorporates, standards consistent with voluntary compliance code standards adopted by the medical device industry to promote compliance with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Despite our compliance program, we cannot be certain that we have always operated in full compliance with all applicable healthcare laws.
 Many foreign countries have similar laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Foreign laws and regulations may vary greatly from country to country. For example, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EU Directives concerning misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
 Data Privacy and Security Laws
 We are, or in the future may, become subject to various U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers.
 Within the United States, our operations may be affected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, collectively, HIPAA, which impose obligations on certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and certain of their “business associate” contractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information (referred to as “Protected Health Information” or “PHI”). We are a business associate of HIPAA covered entities under some of our lines of business. In our business associate relationships, we must comply with applicable HIPAA requirements and the contractual terms of our business associate agreements with HIPAA covered entities. In addition, HIPAA may affect our interactions with customers who are covered entities or their business associates because HIPAA affects the ability of these entities to disclose PHI to us. Various states also have laws that regulate the privacy and security of personal information and so may affect our business operations. Most notably, in 2018, California passed into law the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 
 24


2020 and imposed many requirements on businesses that process the personal information of California residents. Many of the CCPA’s requirements are similar to those found in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679), or GDPR, including requiring businesses to provide notice to data subjects regarding the information collected about them and how such information is used and shared, and providing data subjects the right to request access to such personal information and, in certain cases, request the erasure of such personal information. The CCPA also affords California residents the right to opt-out of “sales” of their personal information. The CCPA contains significant penalties for companies that violate its requirements. It also provides California residents a private right of action, including the ability to seek statutory damages, in the event of a data breach involving their data. In addition to California, many states have laws that impose fines on entities that experience a data breach involving certain types of personal data or that permit consumers to bring private actions against parties that experience a breach involving their data.
 European Data Privacy and Data Security
 In the European Union, we may be subject to laws relating to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identified or identifiable individual) because we process personal data of our employees, customers, vendors and other third parties based in the European Union in relation to the operation of our business.
 In the European Union, the data privacy regime applicable to us includes the GDPR and the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC (“EPD”). We depend on a number of third parties to provide our services, a number of which process personal data on our behalf and are therefore considered our processors under the GDPR. With each such provider we enter into contractual arrangements to ensure that they only process personal data according to our instructions, and that they have sufficient technical and organizational measures in place to safeguard the data. Where we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we do so in compliance with the relevant data export requirements. We take our data protection obligations seriously as any improper disclosure, particularly with regard to our customers’ sensitive personal data, could negatively impact our business and/or our reputation.
 GDPR
 The GDPR became applicable on May 25, 2018 and replaced the previous data protection regime which consisted of separate laws issued by each EU Member State, based on the EU Data Protection Directive. Unlike the Directive (which needed to be transposed at a national level), the GDPR is directly applicable in each EU Member State, resulting in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the European Union. However, the GDPR does allow each Member State to implement laws which supplement the GDPR, causing some variation between EU Member States (for example, in connection with processing employee personal data and processing personal data for scientific purposes). The GDPR also provides that EU Member States may separately introduce further conditions, including limitations, to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data, or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. We need to ensure compliance with the supplemental laws in each jurisdiction where we operate, either through having an establishment or through offering goods or services to, or monitoring the behavior of, data subjects located in such jurisdiction.
 The GDPR imposes accountability obligations requiring controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and policies. It requires us, as a controller of personal data, to be transparent and to disclose to data subjects (being the individuals to whom the personal data relates), in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form, how their personal information is used by us. It also imposes limitations on our retention of information, introduces requirements to pseudonymize (i.e., key-code) data, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements and sets certain standards for controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities.
 The requirements also state that personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes which have a legal basis set out in the GDPR and may only be processed in a manner consistent with those purposes. Personal data must also be adequate, relevant, and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and protected using appropriate technical and organizational measures. In addition, personal data must not be transferred outside of the EEA unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection. The GDPR also requires that the data not be kept for longer than necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected. To the extent that we process, control or otherwise use sensitive data relating to individuals (for example, individuals’ health or medical information, race or ethnicity), more stringent rules apply, limiting the circumstances and the manner in which we are legally permitted to process that data and transfer that data outside of the EEA. In particular, in order to process such data, an additional legal permission is required, such as explicit consent of the data subject to the processing. 
 Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR have the potential to be significant—the greater of EUR 20 million or 4% of our global annual revenue in the previous financial year.

EPD
 The requirements laid down by the EPD have been transposed into the national laws of each EEA Member State since 2003. The requirements are particularly relevant when we send electronic direct marketing to individuals in the EEA or when we use cookies or similar technologies on our websites with respect to individuals located in the EEA and will usually require us to obtain consent from such recipients to carry out these activities. Although all EEA Member State national laws stem from the EPD, the laws differ by jurisdiction, sometimes significantly. We need to ensure compliance with the laws in each jurisdiction where we operate.
 The European Union is in the process of replacing the EPD with an E-Privacy Regulation which, unlike the EPD which needed to be transposed into the national law of EEA Member States, will be directly applicable in each EEA Member State. The text of the new Regulation has not yet been finalized nor has an implementation date been set. We will continue to monitor the progress of the new Regulation and make necessary modifications to our practices as and when required.
 Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
 For example, the Patient Protection an Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Healthcare Reform Act, substantially changed the way in which healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The Healthcare Reform Act also provides incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the Healthcare Reform Act provided additional federal funding to state Medicaid programs that expanded eligibility for Medicaid programs and required individuals to obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty.
 There have been administrative, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Healthcare Reform Act, and we expect additional challenges and amendments in the future. 
 
With respect to Congressional action, tax legislation enacted at the end of 2017 removed penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance effective in 2019. The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the Healthcare Reform Act. In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Healthcare Reform Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Healthcare Reform Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. It remains to be seen whether and how quickly the Biden administration may take executive action to accelerate the Healthcare Reform Act’s implementation. In December 2018, a federal district court found the Healthcare Reform Act unconstitutional in its entirety because, once Congress repealed the individual mandate provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. On appeal, a federal appeals court held in December 2019 that the individual mandate portion of the Healthcare Reform Act was unconstitutional and left open the question whether the remaining provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act would be valid without the individual mandate. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the states and individuals that brought the lawsuit challenging the ACA’s individual mandate do not have standing to challenge the law, and accordingly, did not rule on the merits of the suit regarding whether the individual mandate was severable from the rest of the ACA. We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products (or the services provided using our products) or additional pricing pressure. Future healthcare legislation could also have a significant impact on our business. Due to the uncertainties regarding the outcome of future healthcare reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation, however, we cannot predict which, if any, of the future reform proposals will be adopted or the effect such adoption may have on us.
 26


In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Healthcare Reform Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken.
 Laws Relating to Foreign Trade
 We are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices. These laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. Additionally, interactions with or on the part of our vendors or other agents may also implicate the FCPA. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents unique challenges in the medical device industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials.
 Our international operations could also be subject to compliance with national laws of other countries, such as the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, or the U.K. Bribery Act. The U.K. Bribery Act applies to any company “carrying on business” in the United Kingdom, irrespective of where the offending conduct occurs. The U.K. Bribery Act applies to bribery activities both in the public and private sector and prohibits the provision of an “advantage” intended to induce or reward “improper performance” of the recipient’s function. The failure by a company to prevent third parties from providing a bribe on its behalf could also constitute an offense. Penalties under the U.K. Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances.
 There are also trade laws within the United States and in other regions that regulate the sale, purchase, import, export, re-export, transfer and shipment of goods, currency, products, materials, services and technology. Violations of these laws can lead to serious consequences, including substantial fines.
 Other Regulations
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Seasonality
 Although we did not experience seasonality during 2020 or 2021 due to demand for our High Velocity Therapy technology during the COVID-19 pandemic, historically prior to COVID-19 we have experienced seasonality in our first and fourth quarters, and we expect this trend to continue. We have experienced and may in the future experience higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of increased sales from hospitals nearing their fiscal year-end that have not fully utilized the funds allocated to purchases of our Precision Flow systems. In the first quarter of each year we have experienced and may in the future experience higher sales in direct correlation with the number of patients presenting with respiratory distress due to the severity of the flu season, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. We expect COVID-19 to be a permanent part of the respiratory landscape similar to the flu or RSV. While COVID-19 surges are unpredictable, we believe that these surges will be aligned to changes in seasons when individuals spend more time inside. Thus, we believe that COVID-19 will most likely impact the first and fourth quarters of the year.

Employees
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 550 employees and contractors, consisting of approximately 510 full-time employees and contractors and approximately 40 part-time contractors. Of these 550 employees and contractors, 512 of them are located in the United States, 15 of them in the United Kingdom and nine of them in Germany. None of our domestic employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. As of December 31, 2021, two of our international team members were subject to a collective bargaining agreement, comprised of two individuals retained through professional employment organizations. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. 
Our Culture
 As part of our corporate culture, we encourage our employees to make decisions, think outside the box and operate with flexibility and speed. To meet the rapidly growing needs of our Customers’, our teammates often face tight deadlines requiring overtime or work outside of normal business hours. We seek to recognize and reward our teammates for these efforts by hosting social activities to help strengthen teams and allow for different departments to get together in a casual setting. We host all company monthly Town Hall Meetings where we share updates on team development, quality initiatives, and patient stories, and recognize employees for embodying our Guiding Principles. We’ve earned Business New Hampshire Magazine’s “Best Company to Work For” recognition every year since the start of our involvement in the competition in 2016.
Code of Business Conduct and Professional Culture Principles
 As part of our Mission, we are committed to conducting all of our business in a law-abiding and principled fashion and maintaining a professional culture. Each employee agrees to follow our Code of Business Conduct. We also understand that guidance is most impactful when teams have ownership in its creation, and to that end, our employees have established Professional Culture Principles, which are three bedrock principles that are universally applicable and help guide our employee decision-making. Our Professional Culture Principles are: 
 To achieve our shared Mission, we …
 
Actively seek and provide feedback, 
 Count on one another to act with integrity,
 Treat everyone with respect.
 
Recognizing that our Professional Culture Principles and Code of Business Conduct may not address every situation our employees may encounter, other resources exist to assist our employees in their decision-making, including our management team and Professional Conduct hotline. 
Employee Engagement
 
We provide all employees with the opportunity to share their opinions and feedback through a culture survey that is typically performed twice per year. Results of the survey are measured and analyzed to enhance the employee experience, promote retention, drive change, and leverage the overall success of our organization. Programs we have implemented in response to these surveys include monthly “Listening Lunches” hosted by our Chief Executive Officer and our Bright Idea Program where we solicit new ideas from employees to streamline processes, improve workflow and/or reduce costs.
Employee Development and Training
 We recognize that successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining top talent in all areas of the business. In furtherance of our Guiding Principle to Hire, Develop & Retain The Very Best People In the Medical Device Industry, we have an employee referral program to encourage our employees to help us to hire other talented individuals into the organization. We strive to hire the best fit for the role and for the team, and develop our existing employees in their current roles as well as preparing them for future roles within our company. On an annual basis, our Leadership Team participates in a talent review and succession planning exercise to identify organizational needs, development opportunities, and potential future leaders. This enables us to identify the resources and skill sets needed to meet our growth objectives. We perform quarterly employee evaluations and annual manager effectiveness evaluations where all team members provide input on how their leader is doing. We promote a continuous learning environment encouraging employees to attend relevant seminars and informational sessions and often refer tools for further development. We also offer monthly and yearly professional development opportunities to team members of all levels, including: Lab and Lecture for Leaders, Women’s Leadership Group, Communication Workshops, Annual Companywide Training Week, New Leader Bootcamp and ESL Courses.

Employee Safety, Health and Wellness
 
We are committed to maintaining a safe workplace and promoting the health and wellness of our employees. We have implemented multiple safety programs and regularly perform safety hazard evaluations within our manufacturing facility. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees have been our first and foremost focus as we implemented a number of measures to provide a safe work environment. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in 2020, we quickly shifted to a fully remote work environment where possible, while field-based sales and clinical employees continued to support accounts, utilizing technology to engage with customers in virtual settings when physical access is prohibited. When allowed to go into hospital accounts, our field team was there to answer any customer request which often required urgently needed visits, education and deliveries at all hours of the day, night and weekend. Our team was there to support those on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic in any way they could. During the initial months of the pandemic, when critical resources were sparse, we provided “Essential Bags” to our Production and Warehouse employees on a weekly basis filled with toilet paper, hand sanitizer and non-perishable food items to help make a stressful personal situation a bit easier for all. 
 
With respect to health and wellness, we want our employees to be their best self and therefore provide them access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs designed to support their physical and mental health. These include, among others, health savings and flexible spending accounts, flexible work schedules, family leave and care resources, an on-site wellness coach, fitness classes, stress management sessions, and employee assistance programs, such as our Breathe Easy Fund, which supports employees and their families through times of hardship by the utilization of employee-raised funds. During 2021, we encouraged employees to get a COVID-19 vaccine by sharing information on the process of how to register and voluntarily extended paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave coverage under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act into mid-2021. 
 
Compensation and Benefits
 We provide competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to salaries, our compensation and benefits, which vary by country/region, are in place as part of our “Pay for Performance” culture and can include annual bonuses, commission programs, stock-based compensation awards, employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) plan with employee matching opportunities, tuition assistance, among many others. We believe in perpetuating an ownership culture throughout our organization. To that end, today approximately 94% of our team has equity in our Company that they either were granted upon hire or earned through performance. Our compensation program also includes several recognition awards throughout the year, including a formal award ceremony during our Annual “Vapotherm Invests in People” Week where we recognize the Impact Player of the Year, Innovator of the Year and Disciplined Planning & Execution of the Year and provide the recipients with additional stock-based compensation, money towards a vacation and extra paid-time off days.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 
In furtherance of our Professional Culture Principle to treat everyone with respect, we strive to create a diverse workplace in which all employees feel respected, valued and empowered to reach their full potential. We define diversity as the range of human differences, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, social class, physical ability or attributes, religious or ethical values system, national origin, and political beliefs. We hold Diversity & Inclusion Roundtable sessions every other month both in person and virtually where we discuss different aspects of diversity and inclusion, why it is important to our business and how we can seek to further focus on it at Vapotherm. To facilitate diversity, we implement recruitment strategies to encourage diverse candidates to apply to positions for which they qualify.
Community Engagement
 
Throughout the year, we engage in community programs, such as our Care in the Air Day where our team is deployed to volunteer at local charitable organizations to give back to the local community. We give back to local families in need through our partnership with St. Vincent de Paul and New Hampshire Foster Care where we donate Thanksgiving baskets and Christmas gifts during the holidays. We also host our Annual Patient of the Year Celebration where Patient families are brought in from across the country and tell their story about how Vapotherm was able to help them. This event allows us to celebrate our Patients, as well as our great People who make, sell and develop our products, and demonstrates to our employees that their work with Vapotherm matters and impacts Patients and the greater community.
