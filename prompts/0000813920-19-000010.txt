ITEM 1. Business.
Company Overview
We believe we are a leading family entertainment and dining company, focused on providing an exciting, fun-filled play and food experience for children and parents alike. We develop, operate and franchise family dining and entertainment centers (also referred to as “venues”) under the names “Chuck E. Cheese’s” (“Where A Kid Can Be A Kid”) and “Peter Piper Pizza”(“Pizza Made Fresh, Families Made Happy”). Our venues deliver a lively, kid-friendly atmosphere and feature a broad array of entertainment offerings including arcade-style and skill-oriented games, rides, live entertainment shows, and other attractions, with the opportunity for our guests to win tickets that they can redeem for prizes. We combine this memorable entertainment experience with a broad and creative menu that combines kid-friendly classics as well as a selection of sophisticated options for adults. We offer families a highly compelling value proposition, where a family of four, for as little as $9 per person, can dine at Chuck E. Cheese's for food, drinks and entertainment, which we believe to be significantly lower than comparable offerings at both casual dining and entertainment alternatives. We believe the combination of wholesome entertainment, family dining and a strong value proposition creates a highly differentiated experience, which appeals to our diverse customer base. We operate 554 venues and have 196 venues operating under franchise arrangements across 47 states and 14 foreign countries and territories as of December 30, 2018.
In Fiscal 2018, we generated $896.1 million in revenue, $20.5 million of net loss and $175.2 million in Adjusted EBITDA. See Item 6. “Selected Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information about Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin.
We have developed iconic brands and a highly loyal customer base through our more than 40-year commitment to being a family-fun and entertainment company. Over the last few years, we have invested in revitalizing our guest experience, revamping our menu offering, modifying our marketing message, and reinvigorating our corporate culture. We have made corresponding investments in technology, staff training, and our physical assets. We believe these significant investments position our Company for sustained growth in the future. 
Our Brands
Chuck E. Cheese's: Where A Kid Can Be A Kid. Chuck E. Cheese's was founded in 1977 and is a highly recognized brand that uniquely appeals to our primary customer base of families with children between 2 and 12 years of age. Chuck E. Cheese, our iconic, energetic mouse mascot, performs music and entertainment shows along with his friends, providing free entertainment to our guests and driving strong brand recognition. Chuck E. Cheese's venues feature an open and bright setting, which creates an inviting atmosphere for kids and a good line of sight for parents. Showrooms include approximately 75 games, rides and attractions for kids of all ages, including classic skill games, such as arcade basketball, Skee-Ball and Whack-a-Mole, as well as the Ticket Blaster machine where birthday guests can grab as many tickets as possible in 30 seconds. In the third quarter of 2018 we launched All You Can Play (“AYCP”), a first-of-its-kind gaming experience that allows kids access to play every game at Chuck E. Cheese’s as many times as they want on any day, without any restrictions, in all our domestic Company-operated Chuck E. Cheese’s venues. Our menu features fresh, hand-made pizza, sandwiches, boneless and bone-in chicken wings, desserts and beverages, including beer and wine. We also offer high-energy musical entertainment and live performances featuring our iconic Chuck E. Cheese character with frequent appearances on our showroom and gameroom floor. As of December 30, 2018, there were 606 Chuck E. Cheese's locations in 47 states and 14 foreign countries and territories, of which 515 are Company-operated.
Peter Piper Pizza: Pizza Made Fresh, Families Made Happy. Peter Piper Pizza serves fresh, high-quality handcrafted food, craft beer and wine, and offers state-of-the-art games for all ages. Venues feature a bold design and contemporary layout, with open kitchens revealing much of the handcrafted food preparation, such as fresh mozzarella being shredded off the block, vegetables being hand-chopped, wings being hand-tossed and our Certified Dough Masters crafting pizzas with made-from-scratch dough. Our large, open dining areas provide an enjoyable atmosphere for families and group events, with attentive staff dedicated to providing an enjoyable and memorable experience to each guest. As of December 30, 2018, there were 144 Peter Piper Pizza locations in the United States (also referred to as “U.S.”) and Mexico, of which 39 are Company-operated.
We believe Peter Piper Pizza is complementary to Chuck E. Cheese's, offering guests a pizza-anchored menu and entertainment in ways that create very different experiences from Chuck E. Cheese's. Peter Piper Pizza is a food-first experience with more sophisticated food offerings (e.g., sriracha pizzas) and a décor/layout package that creates more of a neighborhood pizzeria feel for guests. While the venues offer games, the game packages target older children and are generally 
5

placed in the back of the restaurant behind a glass wall to protect the dining experience for adults. With this approach, Peter Piper Pizza is not only popular with families, but also attracts a guest base that includes many adults without children. In addition to everyday visits for the excellent food, adults without families are common customers for the day-time buffet on their weekday lunch break and frequently choose Peter Piper Pizza's carryout option, which can also be ordered online.
During the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, approximately 57% and 27% of our Company-operated venue revenue for Chuck E. Cheese's and Peter Piper Pizza, respectively, was from entertainment and merchandise. For the same period, food and beverage made up 43% and 73% of company venue revenue for Chuck E. Cheese's and Peter Piper Pizza, respectively. 
Our Company has benefited from the 2014 acquisition of Peter Piper Pizza through the implementation of best corporate practices and synergies from both brands. Peter Piper Pizza has benefited from lower procurement costs under CEC Entertainment's ownership, as Chuck E. Cheese's is one of the largest purchasers of arcade games in the United States. We believe the combination of Chuck E. Cheese's and Peter Piper Pizza positions our brands for sustained growth through the realization of synergies and further implementation of best corporate practices across our brands. 
Although these brands are complementary in many ways, we believe that these are distinct concepts that do not directly compete. Peter Piper Pizza operates smaller venues with a primary emphasis on food, resulting in an older customer demographic with higher frequency visits.
Our Competitive Strengths
We attribute our success in large part to our established recognized brands, our unique and differentiated experience, our value-oriented family experience, our diversified and resilient business model and our experienced management team. Our venues are unique in that we combine a wholesome family dining offering with distinctive family-oriented games, rides, activities, shows and other entertainment alternatives, all under one roof and within convenient driving distance from our guests’ homes. Many of our high quality entertainment offerings, including all of our live and interactive shows in Chuck E. Cheese’s venues, guest Wi-Fi in all our venues, and live television in our Peter Piper Pizza venues, can be experienced free of charge. We also offer our guests packaged offerings whereby they can receive a combination of food, drinks and game credits, time blocks or tokens at discounted prices. We believe that we benefit from strong and consistent demand for our entertainment offerings from families who desire high quality, safe, clean, convenient and affordable ways to spend time with their children outside of the home. Our executive management team has significant experience in the leisure, hospitality, entertainment and family dining industries and has significant expertise in operating complex, themed family entertainment businesses.
Our Strategic Plan
Our strategic plan is focused on increasing comparable venue sales, improving profitability and margins and expanding our venues domestically and internationally.
Increase Comparable Venue Sales. Our core strategy to grow comparable venue sales is achieved by protecting and
enhancing the service provided to children through a lively, kid-friendly atmosphere, while improving the experience for adults. During 2018, we delivered experience enhancements through technology investments, attractive game-play packages, new games, remodels of our venues, and menu innovation.
Recent technology investments allow us to offer more compelling offerings to a wider variety of guests:

• | Play Pass card system: In 2018, we completed the deployment of our proprietary Play Pass card system at all Company-operated Chuck E. Cheese’s venues. Guests can purchase “points” on reloadable plastic cards and use these cards to play our games.


• | AYCP: In the third quarter of 2018, we completed the roll-out of AYCP at all of our domestic Company-operated Chuck E. Cheese’s venues. This product leverages our Play Pass card system and allows guests the option to play unlimited games within a specified period of time. As of December 30, 2018, AYCP accounted for approximately 50% of our entertainment revenues.


• | More Tickets: We believe our guests enjoy the thrill of winning tickets and redeeming them for our merchandise. During the third quarter of 2018, we completed the roll-out of higher ticket payouts at our redemption games, coupled with a smaller adjustment to the ticket “prices” of our merchandise.


• | Gameplay promotions: Play Pass technology allows us to vary pricing and offerings by geography and day part within a venue. During 2018, we began offering guests promotions that included discounts during slow school days, surge pricing on select weekends and holidays, and traffic-driving deals like discounted AYCP.

Other initiatives designed to grow sales:

• | Remodeling our venues to provide a modern, fresh look: In 2017, we began testing a redesigned concept at seven of our Chuck E. Cheese’s venues which carefully targeted areas to improve family experience and comfort. Changes included a new exterior and signage, brighter interiors, art décor on the walls, digital menu boards, a new star dance stage, and pizza windows that allow guests to view the pizza being made. In 2018, we completed 25 remodels and have plans for 60 in 2019.


• | Refreshing and improving our marketing: We focus on connecting with kids via national television, gaming and promotional opportunities. We also focus on connecting with moms through national television advertising, digital advertising, cross-promotional coupons, social media, public relations and e-mail.


• | Improved menu offerings and birthday reservations: We continue to enhance the guest experience by introducing new menu items, attractive packaging, promotional programs and simplifying our online birthday ordering system.


• | “More Cheese” customer loyalty program: In the first quarter of 2018, we launched our first customer loyalty program where guests can earn awards and discounts based on purchases.

Finally, we believe that we can modify pricing, couponing and packaging in select markets across the United States while still continuing to provide our guests with a strong value proposition when compared to other family dining-entertainment options. 
Improve Profitability and Margins. Our business model benefits from substantial operating leverage, enabling us to drive margin improvement. We continuously focus on delivering financial performance through expense rationalization across all of our venues and functions. We believe that the deployment of best corporate practices across each of our brands and our corporate functions will yield continued margin improvement. Our general managers at our venues and our corporate management staff typically have revenue, profit and customer satisfaction incentives, which foster a strict focus on both providing a high-quality experience for our guests and expense control. Additionally, we have implemented several new technology investments over the past three years that we believe will drive continued cost savings. These investments include our enhanced labor management tool, a system-wide upgrade of our point-of-sale terminals and an improved venue inventory management system that provides additional visibility into food cost measurements and automates our replenishment cycles. These initiatives have generated cost efficiencies in a number of key areas, including labor, supplies, food and general and administrative expenses, and we expect these cost efficiencies to continue in the future.
Finally, in 2018 we re-aligned the activities of our corporate office in order to more efficiently serve our operators. We expect these efforts to result in approximately $2.5 million in annual savings.
Pursue New Venue Growth Domestically and Internationally. We have a long track record of successful new venue development and will continue to pursue a disciplined venue growth strategy in both new and existing markets where we can achieve strong cash-on-cash returns. For new venue openings, we follow a rigorous due diligence and site selection process and strategically locate our venues within convenient driving distance to large metropolitan areas. Our venues generate strong cash flow and perform consistently well across geographic regions, which demonstrates the portability of our concept to new domestic and international markets. We have a successful track record of opening new Company-operated Chuck E. Cheese's venues at attractive rates of return and believe our existing markets can support additional venues. 
As of December 30, 2018, we have 109 international venues operating under franchise arrangements. We plan to grow internationally with existing and new franchise partners. In 2018, we opened 8 new venues collectively in five countries, with one new franchised Chuck E. Cheese venue and one new franchised Peter Piper Pizza venue in the United States and six new franchised Chuck E. Cheese's venues in four other countries.
See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Expenditures” for more information regarding our capital initiatives and expenditures.
Overview of Operations
Food and Beverage
Each Chuck E. Cheese’s and Peter Piper Pizza venue offers a variety of pizzas, wings, appetizers, salads and desserts, as well as certain gluten-free options. Soft drinks, coffee and tea are also served, along with beer and wine in many locations. Chuck E. Cheese’s venues also offer sandwiches, and most Chuck E. Cheese’s and Peter Piper Pizza venues offer lunch buffet 
7

options with unlimited pizza, salad, breadsticks and dessert. We continuously focus on delivering a quality-driven product and believe the quality of our food compares favorably with that of our competitors. 
Food and beverage sales represented 45.3%, 47.3% and 45.8% of our Company-operated venue sales during Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.
Entertainment and Merchandise
Each of our Chuck E. Cheese’s and Peter Piper Pizza venues has a gameroom area, which includes an array of amusement and entertainment options. These options range from classic arcade, redemption and skill games, such as air hockey, skee-ball and basketball, to rides, such as mini trains, motorcycles and various driving games. At Chuck E. Cheese’s, we also offer musical and comical entertainment that features our iconic Chuck E. Cheese character with live performances and frequent appearances on our showroom and gameroom floor, as well as ongoing entertainment featuring music videos and televised skits. Each Peter Piper Pizza venue also offers flat-screen televisions located throughout the dining area. In the first quarter of 2018, we completed the implementation of Play Pass, a new proprietary game card system, in all of our Chuck E. Cheese’s Company-operated venues. Play Pass is similar to a stored value gift card and allows guests to activate games and rides with their own personal card. In addition, in July 2018 we launched AYCP in all of our domestic Chuck E. Cheese’s Company-operated venues. AYCP, a time based play option, allows guests to play unlimited games within a block of time, increasing the number of games, tickets and prizes over Play Pass. More Tickets provides the thrill of winning a greater number of tickets on redemption games. A number of games dispense tickets that can be redeemed by guests for prize merchandise such as toys and plush items. Our guests can also purchase this merchandise directly for cash. 
Entertainment and merchandise sales represented 54.7%, 52.7% and 54.2% of our Company-operated venue sales during Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.
Franchising 
As of December 30, 2018, we franchised a total of 91 Chuck E. Cheese’s venues, with 26 venues located in the United States and 65 venues located in 14 foreign countries and territories, and a total of 105 Peter Piper Pizza venues, with 61 venues located in the United States and 44 venues located in Mexico. We have 18 active development and franchise agreements to open 78 Chuck E. Cheese’s venues in 16 countries, and four signed development and franchise agreements with rights to open another 19 Peter Piper Pizza venues in Texas and one signed development and franchise agreement with rights to open another four venues in Mexico. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding the risks associated with franchise development agreements.
Our standard franchise agreements grant the franchisee the right to construct and operate a venue and use our associated trade names, trademarks and service marks in accordance with our standards and guidelines. Most of our existing Chuck E. Cheese’s franchise agreements have an initial term of 15 to 20 years and include a 10-year renewal option. Peter Piper Pizza’s franchise agreements are for a 10-year term and include a 10-year successor agreement on Peter Piper Pizza’s then standard form of agreement. The standard franchise agreement provides us with a right of first refusal should a franchisee decide to sell a venue. We also enter into area development agreements, which grant franchisees exclusive rights to open a specified number of venues in a designated geographic area within a specified period of time. In addition to initial franchise and area development fees, the franchisee is charged a continuing monthly royalty fee equal to a percentage of its gross monthly sales, generally up to 6%, which varies by location and brand.
In 1985, we and our Chuck E. Cheese’s franchisees formed the International Association of CEC Entertainment, Inc. (the “Association”) to discuss and consider matters of common interest relating to the operation of Company-operated and franchised Chuck E. Cheese’s venues. Routine business matters of the Association are conducted by a board of directors, composed of five members appointed by us and five members elected by the franchisees. The Association serves as an advisory council that, among other responsibilities, oversees expenditures, including (a) the costs of development, purchasing and placement of advertising programs, including websites; (b) the costs to develop and improve audio-visual and animated entertainment attractions, as well as the development and implementation of new entertainment concepts; and (c) the purchase of national network television advertising.
The franchise agreements governing existing franchised Chuck E. Cheese’s in the United States currently require each franchisee to pay to the Association a monthly contribution equal to a certain percentage of its gross monthly sales. Additionally, under these franchise agreements, we are required, with respect to Chuck E. Cheese’s Company-operated venues, to contribute at the same rates, or at higher rates in certain instances, as our franchisees. We and our franchisees are also required to spend minimum amounts on local advertising and could be required to make additional contributions to fund any deficits that may be incurred by the Association. Certain franchise agreements governing existing franchised Chuck E. Cheese’s outside of the United States currently require each franchisee to pay a certain percentage of their gross monthly sales to the Association to fund various advertising, media, and entertainment costs.

We do not currently have any advertising co-ops or a franchise advisory council with our Peter Piper Pizza franchisees, but we reserve the right to require the formation, merger or dissolution of either or both. Franchisees are required to contribute (a) 5% of weekly gross sales to be used to develop, produce, distribute and administer specific advertising, public relations and promotional programs that promote the services offered by system franchisees; and (b) 0.5% of weekly gross sales to be used to research, develop, produce, and support creative ideas and materials for use in commercial advertisements, public relations, and promotional campaigns in the United States and Mexico. We may elect at any time not to collect or maintain all or any portion of the amount contributed to fund advertising related programs and activities and, during such time that we have made such election, the monies not collected must be expended by the franchisees in their own markets. In addition, we are required, with respect to Company-operated Peter Piper Pizza restaurants, to contribute funds on the same basis as our franchisees.
Royalties, franchise and area development fees and other miscellaneous franchise income represented 2.3%, 2.0% and 2.0% of our total consolidated revenues during Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.
Foreign Operations
As of December 30, 2018, we operated a total of 11 Company-operated venues in Canada. Our Canadian venues generated total revenues of $15.8 million, $16.6 million, and $15.6 million during the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, respectively, representing 1.8%, 1.9% and 1.7% of our total consolidated revenues, respectively. All of our other international venues are franchised.
These foreign activities, along with our international franchisees, are subject to various risks of conducting business in a foreign country, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, laws and regulations and economic and political stability. See “Risk Factors” for more information regarding the risks associated with operations located in foreign markets.
Third-Party Suppliers
We use a network of 15 distribution centers operated by a single company to distribute most of the food products and supplies used in our domestic Chuck E. Cheese’s branded venues, five distribution centers for our Canadian Chuck E. Cheese’s branded venues, and four distribution centers for our Peter Piper Pizza branded venues. We believe that alternative third-party distributors are available for our products and supplies, but we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace our distributors or obtain the necessary products and supplies from other suppliers.
We have not entered into any hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility; however, we typically enter into short-term purchasing arrangements, which may contain pricing designed to minimize the impact of commodity price fluctuations.
We procure games, rides and other entertainment-related equipment from a limited number of suppliers, some of which are located in China. The number of suppliers from which we purchase games, rides and other entertainment-related equipment, redemption prizes and merchandise has declined due to industry consolidation over the past several years. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding the risks associated with our third-party suppliers.
Competition
The family dining and entertainment industries are highly competitive, with a number of major national and regional chains operating in each of these markets. In this regard, we compete for customers on the basis of (a) our name recognition; (b) the price, quality, variety, and perceived value of our food and entertainment offerings; (c) the quality of our customer service; and (d) the convenience and attractiveness of our venues. Although there are other concepts that presently utilize the combined family dining and entertainment format, these competitors primarily operate on a regional or market-by-market basis. To a lesser extent, we also compete directly and/or indirectly with other dining and entertainment formats, including full-service and quick-service restaurants appealing to families with young children, the quick service pizza segment, movie theaters, themed amusement attractions, and other entertainment facilities for children.
Intellectual Property
We own various trademarks and proprietary rights, including Chuck E. Cheese’s®, Where A Kid Can Be A Kid®, Peter Piper Pizza® and the Chuck E. Cheese character image used in connection with our business, which have been registered with the appropriate patent and trademark offices. The duration of such trademarks is unlimited, subject to continued use and renewal. We believe that we hold the necessary rights for protection of the trademarks considered essential to conduct our business. We believe our trade names and our ownership of trademarks and proprietary rights in the names and character likenesses featured in the operation of our venues provide us with an important competitive advantage, and we actively seek to protect our interests in such property.

Seasonality
Our operating results fluctuate seasonally. We typically generate our highest sales volumes during the first quarter of each fiscal year due to the timing of school vacations, holidays and changing weather conditions. School operating schedules, holidays and weather conditions may also affect our sales volumes in some operating regions differently than others. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for our full fiscal year.
Government Regulation
We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the development and operation of Chuck E. Cheese’s and Peter Piper Pizza venues. For a discussion of government regulation risks to our business, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Employees 
As of December 30, 2018, we employed approximately 16,800 employees, including approximately 16,400 in the operation of our Company-operated venues and approximately 400 in our corporate offices. Our employees do not belong to any union or collective bargaining group. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory, and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our venues.
Each Chuck E. Cheese’s and Peter Piper Pizza venue typically employs a general manager, senior assistant manager, one or more assistant managers, an electronics specialist who is responsible for repair and maintenance of the show, games and rides, and approximately 25 to 45 food preparation and service employees, many of whom work part-time. Our staffing requirements are seasonal, and the number of people we employ at our venues will fluctuate throughout the year.
