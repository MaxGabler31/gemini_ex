ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction

Sharing Services, Inc. (SHRV, we or the Company) is a diversified holding company specializing in the direct selling industry. The Company owns, operates, or controls an interest in a variety of companies that sell products and services to the consumer directly through independent representatives that range from health and wellness, energy, technology, insurance services, training, media and travel benefits. Our website is https://www.sharingservicesinc.com. We believe our management team and affiliated companies and consultants are industry leaders with extensive experience in all the areas of the direct selling or network marketing industry as well as familiarity with our product offerings.

The Company was originally formed to develop and market a taxi-ride sharing website and application (web app). Beginning in February 2017, the Company expanded its business model to also offer a wide range of travel and technology management products and services which are currently being offered through direct channels. 

In December 2017, the Company launched a wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the trade name Elepreneurs. Elepreneurs meaning is derived from Elevated Entrepreneur. This subsidiary is structured as a sales and marketing company that currently has over 10,000 independent representatives and markets all the Companys products and services. One of the leading product lines of Elepreneurs is called Elevate. The Elevate product line consists of Nutraceutical products which the Company terms D.O.S.E. (Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin and Endorphins) and was developed and is owned by another of the Companys wholly-owned subsidiaries, Elevacity Global. This product line has accelerated the Companys growth over the last two quarters enabling the Company to expand its operations and expand into the direct selling industry at a rapid pace.

The Company uses a direct-selling model with a subscription-based portal and, as part of its growth strategy, has 
completed several acquisitions and purchases of equity interest in businesses it believes have a leading position in the direct selling industry, technology management sectors and services directly relating to this industry. Subject to approval by its Board of Directors (the Board), the Company intends to continue to make strategic acquisitions of and purchases of equity interests in businesses that complement its business competencies and growth strategy 
to meet or exceed its objectives and create shareholder value. 

Please see Significant Recent Acquisitions and Our Acquisition and Growth Strategy below.

The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 24, 2015 and has a fiscal year ending April 30.

Significant Recent Acquisitions

Total Travel Media

On May 23, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Total Travel Media, Inc. a Nevada corporation (Total Travel Media or TTM). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of TTM in exchange for (i) 10,000,000 shares of the Companys Common Stock Class B, par value $0.0001 per share and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of the Companys Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Series B Preferred Stock). 

TTM is a leading travel and technology management product and services provider. TTM produces videos and interactive tools for hotels, resorts and other travel-related locations that will show the consumer the benefits of such. In addition, it is designed to attract visitors and consumers through social media to those specific locations and has uses for personal social media exposure for celebrities and high-profile individuals.

Four Oceans

On September 29, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Four Oceans Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (Four Oceans). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Four Oceans in exchange for the issuance of 75,000,000 shares of the Companys Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock). Following the closing, Four Oceans became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

1

Prior to the Companys acquisition of Four Oceans, it was controlled by Alchemist Holdings, LLC, a company controlled by the Chairman of our Board of Directors. Alchemist Holdings received 50,000,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock; Bear Bull Market Dividends, Inc., a Company that is a significant shareholder of Sharing Services, received 20,000,000 shares; and Research and Referral BZ, a shareholder of the Company, received 5,000,000 shares. Since these transactions are between entities under common control, the Company treated the acquisition under the pooling-of-interests method and has consolidated financial results since the initial date in which the above companies were under common control. Assets and liabilities were combined on their carrying values and no recognition of goodwill was made. The Companys calculation of earnings per share is based on the new parent-company shares issued to the shareholders of the Company. 

Four Oceans owns and operates an online travel platform. We believe its online search engine tool, Four Oceans Explorer, provides Elepreneurs-based users the best guaranteed rates, on over 400,000 hotels, cruises, rental cars, extended stays and time-share properties from around the world. It also provides Lifestyle and Marketplace rewards that can allow discounts on many retail products and services.

212 Technologies, LLC

212 Tech has revolutionary technology that has created an APP for the direct selling industry that we believe will change the way Independent Representatives will grow their businesses. This APP will ensure that the users are compliant with the companies they represent and give a clear and concise message to the prospect. In addition, this APP can be marketed to and could benefit any company in the direct selling industry. We plan to use this APP in our organization and license it to many other companies.

Key Industry and Business Trends

We believe the following key industry and business trends and characteristics will influence our growth and our financial results in a positive way going forward:

·
 From 2011 to 2016, the number of people involved in direct selling in the United States grew by 31.4%, outpacing U.S. retail sales growth according to Direct Selling in 2016: An Overview and Direct Selling Fact Sheet published by the Direct Selling Association (DSA) in 2016. By comparison, over the same period, retail sales in the U.S. grew from $29.9 billion to $35.5 billion, up just 19%;

3

·
 Interest in direct selling has been on an upward trend in recent years. In 2011, 15.6 million people in the U.S. were involved in direct selling. In 2016, that number hit 20.5 million, up over 31%;

·
 Classified by major product category, the most lucrative sectors of the direct selling industry include Wellness products and Value-added Services. Wellness products alone, such as those marketed through the Elevacity brand, accounted for more than $12 Billion in sales in 2016;

·
 People involved in direct selling have a higher than average percentage of annual incomes over $50,000, at 58%. They also have a higher level of average education, with 52% of direct sellers being college graduates compared to 28% of all Americans; and

·
 Independent contractors prioritize being ones own boss, flexibility in schedule and having a better work life balance, according to Bloomberg. With these factors in mind, more than three-quarters of independent contractors report being highly satisfied with their work.

Business Segments, Geographic Area Information and Seasonality

Please see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ITEM 8  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained elsewhere in this Annual Report for information about our business segments and geographic area information.

The Companys travel services business is subject to seasonality inherent to the travel and tourism industries in the United States and Canada. The travel and tourism industries experience greater passenger activity in the period from March to September than during the rest of the year. These industries also may be adversely affected by acts of terrorism and natural disasters from time to time. 

We believe sales of our health and wellness, energy, technology, insurance services, training and media products are not seasonal in nature. 

Our Acquisition and Growth Strategy

We believe there are significant opportunities to increase our sales volume and profitability through the further implementation of our growth strategy, including through strategic acquisitions.

During the period from inception (May 5, 2017) to April 30, 2018, we completed several acquisitions and purchases of equity interests in business we believe have a leading position in the direct selling industry, technology management sectors and services directly relating to this industry. Please see Significant Recent Acquisitions above.

Other key elements of our growth strategy are to:

Competitive Strengths

We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and will help drive our future growth: Three key differentiators separate Sharing Services, Inc. from our competitors in the direct sales and traditional consumer spaces. One is our proprietary Elevacity Global product line nutraceuticals D.O.S.E. component which is sourced through exclusive strategic partnerships. The second is our technology-driven marketing initiatives which emphasize the nutritional value or health benefits of our health and wellness product offerings. Third is our ability to offer industry exclusive brands.
Recently Launched Brand

Our goal has been to empower the health-conscious global community with emphasis on Health, Wealth and Happiness. To achieve this objective, we launched our Elevacity product line, marketed and exclusively distributed through our subsidiary Elepreneurs. During the first two quarters of launching this product line we have experienced sales in excess of $8.0 million, and we believe this product line will revolutionize how people take care of their health by facilitating the convergence of the Companys nutraceuticals, advanced technologies and most complete entrepreneurial opportunity in the market place.
Key Products and Services

4

Sharing Services mission is to produce and deliver products and services that improve Health, Wealth and Happiness by creating products and services from within the Companys management team, through strategic partnerships and an independent sales force with the direct selling model. We take pride in our commitment to offering the finest products and services throughout the industry, including, but not limited to:
Elevate Smart Coffee - A great tasting micro-ground, functional coffee that contains a proprietary blend of Nootropic ingredients designed to assist with mental clarity, memory and energy.

Elevate Keto Cre - A delicious non-dairy Ketogenic creamer designed to support a healthy Keto diet.

Elier Serum - Anti-aging skin care designed to deeply nourish and regenerate at the cellular level resulting in a more youthful look. 

Distribution

Our main distribution center is operated by a third-party logistics provider located in Addison, Texas. We also operate a smaller fulfillment center in our corporate headquarters which capitalizes and improves our product distribution and delivery with cost savings and efficiencies for our distributors and customers. We purchase our products from independent formulators and manufacturers. We service individual product orders and ship to individual customers and distributors throughout the United States and Canada, and intend to offer our products to customers in other geographies.

Distributors and their customers pay for products prior to shipment, resulting in minimal amounts of accounts receivables. Distributors and customers are provided a web-based platform to place customer service orders online with the Company and are supported by phone or live chat through our in-house call center.

Competition

The market for our products and services designed to enhance physical and mental performance is large and growing, and intensely competitive. Our primary competitors include other network marketing companies that manufacture and market herbal remedies, nutritional products and personal care products. We also compete with large traditional retail businesses that offer products in similar categories. To attract positive industry attention and hold sustainable market advantage, we emphasize differentiators such as our company culture, our exclusive access to unique ingredients, the quality and efficacy of our products and the reliability and convenience of our distribution system. We emphasize products and services that improve health, wealth and happiness of our distributors and customers rather than one specific product or service that most companies focus on. We take pride in our commitment to offering our distributors and our customers the very best tools and support in the industry.

Herbal remedies, personal care, and nutritional products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution. While we believe that consumers appreciate the convenience of ordering products from home through a sales person they know and trust or through a catalog, the buying habits of many consumers indicate they may not wish to change their preference for purchasing products through traditional retail channels. We address this challenge directly in our marketing approach.

5

We also compete for Elepreneurs (independent distributors) with other direct selling organizations, many of which have a longer operating history, higher visibility, name recognition, and financial resources. Some of the dominant network marketing companies in our existing markets are Amway Corporation, Herbalife and NuSkin Enterprises, to name a few. We also compete with many smaller network marketing companies that also offer personal care products, health and nutrition products. We compete for new Elepreneurs on the strength of our product line, leadership training, compensation plan, marketing focus, corporate values and management leadership strengths.

Product Guarantees

Our 30-day, 100% customer satisfaction policy applies to all our products, sometimes subject to a restocking fee. This policy improves our customer and Elepreneurs satisfaction and brings us in line with Direct Selling Association recommendations. 
Sales and Marketing

We rely on a network marketing system for the distribution of our products through our independent representatives (referred to as Elepreneurs) and customer referrals. Our revenue depends directly upon the sales efforts of our Elepreneurs. We distribute our products exclusively through independent representatives who have contracted directly with the Company. Elepreneurs are entitled to purchase products from us for personal use or for resale, depending on their market, and the sales by our Elepreneurs have the potential to earn commissions. Individuals who join as Elepreneurs may enroll and sponsor other Elepreneurs and may further earn commissions from the resale of products. Our compensation plan provides multiple ways to earn income for our Elepreneurs.

We offer our products online and each Elepreneur position that is purchased also includes a virtual online website. Known as a replicated website and Backoffice,
 this is where Elepreneurs can manage, monitor, and operate their businesses 24 hours a day from any location with internet access. This site is password protected, exclusive to Elepreneurs and provides access to Company news, order information, commission information, product tracking, product information, and a library of Company documents geared to help them with their business, such as frequently-asked questions and various forms and reference materials. We also offer additional for-purchase tools like marketing material and educational tools to help enhance their business experience.

In addition, we offer a replicated website model to our Elepreneurs allowing them to obtain an immediate online presence and personal URL for their business, which they can use as a place to direct potential new Elepreneurs to learn about the Company and sign up as Elepreneurs. Features on this website include Company information, video and flash presentations, prospect management and follow-up, online registration of new Elepreneurs, online product ordering, online customer service and a contact me function that allows anyone visiting the website to contact an Elepreneur directly via email.

Enrollment and Sponsorship

Any person may join the Company as an Elepreneur to purchase products for personal use or to build a sales organization. Elepreneurs are independent contractors and are thus prohibited from representing themselves as our agents or as employees of the Company. Enrollment and sponsorship activities are encouraged, but not required of our Elepreneurs. Successful Elepreneurs will both enroll and sponsor new Elepreneurs. The sponsoring of new Elepreneurs creates multiple levels in a network marketing structure. Individuals that an Elepreneurs sponsors are referred to as downline, or sponsored Elepreneurs. If downline Elepreneurs also sponsor new Elepreneurs, they create additional levels in the structure, but their downline Elepreneurs remain in the same downline network as their original sponsoring Elepreneurs.

Elepreneurs assist their downline Elepreneurs to successfully sponsor new Elepreneurs. While we provide product and Company brochures, magazines, websites, videos and other sales and marketing materials, our greatest success and retention comes from Elepreneurs who are accountable and responsible for educating and training new Elepreneurs with respect to our products and how to build and maintain a successful business.

Generally, Elepreneurs who are new to network marketing invite friends, family and acquaintances to attend conference calls, review websites and marketing materials, or attend personal or company-sponsored meetings. Elepreneurs with a history in direct sales are quick to invite their contacts within the industry to experience the difference that our Company brings to the network marketing profession. Some people are attracted to become Elepreneurs after experiencing our products and desiring to enjoy the wholesale pricing that Elepreneurs receive.

Turnover is a typical aspect of the direct selling or network marketing industry. Our Elepreneurs understand that to prevent a possible decline in their organization and sales volume, the enrollment, sponsoring and training of new 

6

Elepreneurs is necessary to increase the overall Elepreneurs force and motivate new and existing Elepreneurs. We may experience seasonal decreases in Elepreneurs sponsoring and product sales because of holidays and customary vacation periods. We cannot predict the timing or degree of these enrollment fluctuations because of the number of factors that impact the sponsoring of new Elepreneurs. We cannot assure that the number, growth or productivity of our Elepreneurs will be sustained at current levels or increase in the future.

Regular conference calls, the materials available online, training events, corporate events and Elepreneurs Support offerings help to provide a duplicable business model that help new Elepreneurs successfully begin their independent contractor business.

Elepreneurs Contract

A potential Elepreneur must enter into a standard Elepreneurs Agreement which governs the relationship between the Company and the Elepreneurs in accord with our policies and procedures. Elepreneurs, may purchase a non-commissionable Kit which includes all the business building websites, 
web back office and online tools. No product purchases are required to become an Elepreneur, and large inventory product purchases are discouraged. However, in order to receive compensation as an Elepreneurs, personal or customer monthly purchases and/or personal customer sales of a certain amount of volume are required. Our Elepreneurs Agreement and Policies and Procedures, which outline the scope of permissible marketing activities, and information on the compensation plan are provided. Our Elepreneurs rules and guidelines are designed to provide Elepreneurs with maximum flexibility and opportunity within the bounds of governmental regulations regarding product claims, network marketing and prudent business policies and procedures. Elepreneurs are obligated to present our products and business opportunity ethically and professionally. Elepreneurs contractually agree to abide by all local, state and federal laws and regulations pertaining to the advertising, sale and distribution of our products. All advertising must be factual and not misleading and an Elepreneurs account may be terminated for making false claims about the income potential, the compensation plan, or product efficacy.

Elepreneurs must represent to potential Elepreneurs that the receipt of commissions is based on sales and substantial efforts. Products may be promoted by personal contact or by literature produced or approved by the Company. In traditional retail environments, our products generally may not be sold, and the business opportunity may not be promoted.

We are not in a position to provide the same level of direction, motivation, and oversight to our Elepreneurs as we would our own employees because the Elepreneurs are independent contractors residing across the United States and in other countries. We review alleged reports of Elepreneurs misconduct or breach of contract to enforce contract compliance. If we determine that an Elepreneur has violated any of the Elepreneurs Policies or Procedures, we may elect to educate the Elepreneurs regarding the contract terms or impose sanctions such as warnings, probation, suspension of privileges of Elepreneurship, withholding commissions until specified conditions are satisfied, termination of the Elepreneurs rights completely or other appropriate injunctive relief. An Elepreneur may voluntarily terminate their position at any time.

Compensation Plan

We believe our Compensation Plan brings together the best of uni-level compensation plans. Each personally enrolled Elepreneur is considered a personally sponsored position. The Enrollment structure addresses the uni-level features of the plan, with no limit to how many Elepreneurs can be enrolled per level. The Placement structure addresses the features of the plan. Each Elepreneur can have unlimited individuals in their organization, and everyone contributes building by placing their enrollments.

An Elepreneur could begin earning commissions when their personally invited Elepreneurs make the first purchase. Our intention is to ensure that all new Elepreneurs receive the know how to achieve success in this business. We believe we provide a format for them to succeed. Each person begins in the program by enrolling an Elepreneur. They then work to help mentor and educate the Elepreneurs they recruited and others in their organization do the same. We believe when everyone is following the same actions the result can be impressive and it also promotes team building. We believe when people work as a team, they can be rewarded for their team actions. 

The Company pays certain weekly and monthly bonuses and certain matching bonuses. We also offer lucrative one-time cash bonuses to people who reach new ranks for the first time. These cash bonuses vary depending on the level of their success.

Each of our product carries a specified number of commissionable volume, and commissions or bonuses are based on an Elepreneurs personal qualification, organizational, and commission volumes. 

7

An Elepreneur receives commissions based on a percentage of the sales volume of their downline weekly and monthly. Commission qualification volume points are essentially based upon a percentage of the products wholesale cost, net of any sales related taxes. As an Elepreneurs retail business expands, and as they successfully sponsor other Elepreneurs into the business, both of which expand their business, the Elepreneurs can receive more commissions from the expanded sales volume of the downline. An Elepreneur receives weekly commission bonuses by remaining in good standing with the Company and by generating a minimum of Personal Volume (PV).

As with any business, individual results may vary, and will be based on the Elepreneurs personal capacity, business experience, expertise and level of desire. There are no guarantees concerning the level of success Elepreneurs may experience. The examples used in the Companys training materials are exceptional results, which may not apply to an average Elepreneur, and are not intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results. There are several ways for Elepreneurs to get paid under the Companys compensation plan. 

Trademarks, Patents and Intellectual Property

We are in the process of applying for trademark protection in the United States and in other countries where we currently do business or intend to do business in the future. The Company anticipates securing multiple U.S. trademarks and foreign trademarks. As we continue to expand internationally, trademark protection is increasingly important for brand recognition as Elepreneurs and consumer loyalty. It is standard Company practice to follow through with ongoing trademark registration in the United States and other countries where we are experiencing growth.

A number of our products utilize proprietary formulations and processes. Although we do not directly hold any patents currently, a number of our key vendors have secured or applied for patents to maintain exclusivity for the ingredients or integrated products they supply to us. To protect our own intellectual property and proprietary processes that are material to the long-term health and profitability of the Company, we maintain disciplined business practices to manage trade secrets and use various forms of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.
 Our exclusive product is listed, and we exercise special vigilance in the area of compliance. For this reason, we employ a compliance team that closely monitors all company and Elepreneurs messaging and is empowered to edit or remove all non-compliant language pertaining to our products. 

Strategic Partnerships

We maintain good relationships with our key vendors to ensure a continuous supply of our key products. During
 2017 to current we relied on three principal suppliers for our product. Although there are other providers in the world who claim to produce similar products our sourcing information indicates that the products we offer are the best quality.

We retain the freedom to use any competitive suppliers to garner control over our product costs, quality and lead times for manufacturing and delivery. Our inventory control system ensures appropriate available volumes of finished product based on the anticipated movement of each item in our catalog.

Regulatory Environment

Direct Selling Activities

Direct selling activities are regulated by various federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States and by similar agencies in foreign countries. We believe the Companys method of distribution is in compliance in all material respects with the laws and regulations relating to not-for-resale and direct selling activities in the United States, and other countries where we operate. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive practices, often referred to as pyramids, money games, business opportunity or chain sales schemes that promise quick rewards for little or no effort, require high entry costs, use high-pressure recruiting methods, and/or do not involve legitimate products. These laws and regulations can impose certain cancellation or product return obligations on us, impose inventory buy-backs obligations on us and provide cooling-off rights for consumers. In addition, such laws and regulations can require us to register with governmental agencies and can otherwise impose limiting regulatory requirements on us.

The purpose of these laws and regulations is to ensure that Elepreneurs are compensated for sales of products and not for recruitment of new Elepreneurs. The extent and provisions of these laws vary from state to state and internationally. International laws may impose significant restrictions and limitations on our business operations. For example, in foreign countries where we have not yet established a local office, our Elepreneurs and customers may 

8

purchase product through a not-for-resale program enabling them to receive product for personal consumption, but may not be allowed to retail the product to consumers.

Any assertion or determination that we are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We cannot assure that regulatory authorities in our existing markets will not impose new legislation or change existing legislation that might adversely affect our business in those markets. Also, we cannot assure that new judicial interpretations of existing law will not be issued that adversely affect our business. Regulatory action, whether or not it results in a final determination adverse to us, has the potential to create negative publicity, with detrimental effects on the motivation and recruitment of our Elepreneurs and, consequently, on our revenue and net income.

Regulation of Personal Care and Nutritional Food Products

Our products and related marketing and advertising are subject to governmental regulation by various domestic
 federal, state and local agencies and authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates food, medical products and cosmetics. The advertising and marketing of our products are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces consumer protection laws regarding truth in advertising. The Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from unreasonable risk of injuries and death associated with consumer products, and the U. S. Department of Agriculture regulates food safety and quality. Similar types of agencies also exist in our foreign markets. To date, we have not experienced any governmental actions related to health or safety and food and drug regulations for our products.

Our markets have regulations concerning product formulation, labeling and packaging. These laws and regulations often require us to, among other things, conform product labeling to the language and regulations, and register or qualify products with the applicable government authority or obtain necessary approvals or file necessary notifications for the marketing of such products. Many of our existing markets also regulate product claims and advertising. These laws regulate the types of claims and representations that can be made regarding the capabilities of products. For example, in the United States we are unable to make any claim that our nutritional products will help diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease.
