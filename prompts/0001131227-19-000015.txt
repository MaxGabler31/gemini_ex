ITEM 1—Business
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Hornbeck Offshore Services, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1997. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or like terms refer to Hornbeck Offshore Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated. Hornbeck Offshore Services, Inc. is a leading provider of marine transportation, subsea installation and accommodation support services to exploration and production, oilfield service, offshore construction and U.S. military customers. Since our establishment, we have primarily focused on providing innovative technologically advanced marine solutions to meet the evolving needs of the deepwater and ultra-deepwater energy industry in domestic and select foreign locations. Throughout our history, we have expanded our fleet of vessels primarily through a series of new vessel construction programs, as well as through acquisitions of existing vessels. We maintain our headquarters at 103 Northpark Boulevard, Covington, Louisiana, 70433; our telephone number is (985) 727-2000.
We own and operate one of the youngest and largest fleets of U.S.-flagged, new generation OSVs and MPSVs. In late 2011, we commenced our fifth OSV newbuild program, which also includes the construction of MPSVs. Since that time, we have grown our new generation fleet from 51 OSVs and four MPSVs to 66 OSVs and eight MPSVs. Upon completion of the last two vessels to be delivered under this newbuild program, our expected fleet will be comprised of 66 OSVs and ten MPSVs. Together, these vessels support the deep-well, deepwater and ultra-deepwater activities of the offshore oil and gas industry. Such activities include oil and gas exploration, field development, production, construction, installation, IRM, well-stimulation and other enhanced oil recovery activities. We have also developed a specialized application of our new generation OSVs for use by the U.S. military. Our new generation OSVs and MPSVs have enhanced capabilities that allow us to more effectively support the premium drilling and installation equipment and facilities required for the offshore deep-well, deepwater and ultra-deepwater energy industry. We are one of the top two operators of domestic high-spec new generation OSVs and MPSVs and one of the top three operators of such equipment worldwide, based on DWT. Our fleet is among the youngest in the industry, with a weighted-average age, based on DWT, of nine years.
While we have historically operated our vessels predominately in the U.S. GoM, we have diversified our market presence and now operate in three core geographic markets: the GoM, Mexico and Brazil. In addition to our core markets, we frequently operate in other foreign regions on a project or term charter basis. We have recently operated in the Middle East, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and in other locations in Latin America, including Nicaragua, Guyana, Trinidad and Argentina. We have further diversified by providing specialized vessel solutions to non-oilfield customers, such as the United States military as well as oceanographic research and other customers that utilize sophisticated marine platforms in their operations. In addition, we have provided vessel management services for other vessel owners, such as crewing, daily operational management and maintenance activities. We also operate a shore-base support facility located in Port Fourchon, Louisiana. See "Item 2-Properties" for a listing of our shoreside support facilities. 
Although all of our vessels are physically capable of operating in both domestic and international waters, approximately 76% are qualified under Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, as amended, or the Jones Act, to engage in the U.S. coastwise trade. The two remaining vessels being constructed under our fifth OSV newbuild program are also expected to be eligible for Jones Act coastwise trading privileges. Foreign owned, flagged, built or crewed vessels are restricted in their ability to conduct U.S. coastwise trade and are typically excluded from such trade in the GoM. Of the public company OSV peer group, we own the largest fleet of Jones Act-qualified, new generation OSVs and MPSVs, which we believe offers us a competitive advantage in the GoM. From time to time, we may elect to reflag certain of our vessels to the flag of another nation. We have reflagged 14 Jones Act-qualified OSVs and one Vanuatu-flagged MPSV to Mexican and other flags, including one OSV under Brazilian registry. We believe we currently own and operate one of the youngest and largest fleets of Mexican-flagged new generation OSVs and MPSVs. Once a Jones Act-qualified vessel is reflagged or a new vessel is foreign flagged, it permanently loses the right to engage in U.S. coastwise trade.
We intend to continue our efforts through up cycles and down cycles to maximize stockholder value through our long-term return-oriented growth strategy. We will, as opportunities arise, acquire or construct additional vessels, as well 
1

as divest certain assets that we consider to be non-core or otherwise not in line with our long-term strategy or prevailing industry trends.
DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS
The Deepwater Offshore Energy Industry
The modern quest to explore for and produce energy resources located offshore began in the 1940s. While these offshore operations began in shallow waters, relatively close to shore, technological advances have permitted them to migrate to ever deeper waters and well depths. Until the late 1970s, most offshore activity was technologically and logistically restricted to that which was accessible on the continental shelf, or waters of up to about 500 feet of depth. Since that time, a number of advances have opened drilling regions in deepwater. The initial push into deeper waters was facilitated through the development of “floating” drilling units that could be positioned over a drilling site without being fixed to the seafloor. Petrobras pioneered these techniques in Brazil beginning in the late 1970s as it lacked an accessible “shallow water” continental shelf. The first deepwater project in the United States Gulf of Mexico was completed in 1993 in nearly 3,000 feet of water by Shell Oil Company. That Shell facility produced a then unheard of 46,000 barrels per day from a reservoir tapped at 25,000 feet. Today, exploration and production activities have pushed into the ultra-deepwater, where wells are routinely drilled in water depths of more than 8,000 feet, the deepest having been drilled in approximately 10,000 feet of water.
 In addition to the ability to operate in very deep water, technological advances have also allowed hydrocarbon resources to be detected, drilled for and produced at extreme well depths. “Pre-salt” discoveries in Brazil are being drilled and produced in waters exceeding 5,000 feet and at well depths of more than 35,000 feet. In 2014, Chevron announced first oil from its Jack/St. Malo facility in the GoM, which is expected to produce previously undetectable lower tertiary hydrocarbons at a rate of 94,000 barrels per day from deposits more than 20,000 feet below the seabed situated in 7,000 feet of water. In addition to contending with extreme deepwater and deep well depths, these projects present challenges involving high temperatures and pressures within reservoirs and the associated difficulties of safely bringing those resources to the surface and then transporting them to shoreside locations. Despite these challenges, today deepwater production accounts for approximately 86% of all offshore production in the United States. The GoM production is expected to account for 16% and 17% of total forecast U.S. crude oil production in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Deepwater Regions
The energy industry has had success in many deepwater regions throughout the world. Deepwater drilling efforts are underway in the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean and Asia. However, the so-called “golden triangle” of deepwater activity is comprised of deposits found offshore West Africa, the Eastern coast of South America - dominated by Brazil and more recently, Guyana - and the GoM. Our core markets are the U.S. GoM, Mexico and Brazil.
As large international oil companies were pushed out of participating in many regions of the world by national oil companies intent upon retaining for themselves the economic benefits of national exploitation, the deepwater GoM grew in significance. The deepwater GoM is among the most abundant hydrocarbon regions in the world. Political stability in the United States and accessibility of deepwater lease blocks allows major oil companies to plan, execute and finance the significant long-term commitments that deepwater success requires. While the scale and complexity associated with deepwater projects is considerable, the significant size of the resource discoveries allows companies to replenish reserves on a large scale from relatively few projects. Unlike most onshore exploration and production projects, deepwater projects require long-lead times to plan and execute, but also enjoy long production lives once online. For instance, the first exploratory wells at the Jack/St. Malo fields were drilled in 2003 and 2004 and first oil was not produced until 2014. Now online, Chevron projects that the Jack/St. Malo fields are expected to produce an estimated 500 million oil equivalent barrels over 30 years. Consequently, short term fluctuations in oil and gas prices typically do not have the same impact on sanctioned deepwater projects as such fluctuations may have on other onshore and continental shelf projects. As a result of the severity and length of current on-going commodity price declines, some previously sanctioned deepwater projects have, nevertheless, been deferred and the pace of newly sanctioned projects in the deepwater GoM has slowed considerably since 2015. 
Emerging opportunities for the deepwater offshore energy industry are presented by recent changes in Mexico and Brazil, two of our core markets, which have both recently expanded access to their deepwater regions to foreign operators. In December 2013, the Mexican congress ended PEMEX's 75 year-old monopoly on drilling activities in Mexico and voted in favor of allowing the government to grant contracts and licenses for exploration and production of oil and gas to foreign firms, which previously had been prohibited under Mexico’s constitution. In December 2016, Mexico

conducted its first ever deepwater auctions, which drew bids from several major integrated oil companies, as well as several independent oil companies on 10 deepwater opportunities. In January 2018, Mexico completed a second round of deepwater auctions, awarding 19 of 29 deepwater blocks. In 2018, companies began exploration activities on the deepwater blocks that were awarded. 
Brazil, through its state-owned national oil company, Petrobras, has been a pioneer in deepwater drilling and remains a dominant player in the global deepwater energy industry. Petrobras claims approximately 9.7 billion barrels of proven deepwater and ultra-deepwater resources, the vast majority of which are located in pre-salt formations, which were the driving force behind an ambitious national plan to dramatically increase production by 2023 to 3.4 million barrels per day. These plans were sidelined by declines in the price of oil combined with a wide reaching corruption probe involving Petobras. In light of these difficulties being experienced by Petrobras, in 2016, the Brazilian Congress determined to re-open the vast Brazilian pre-salt regions to foreign operators. Brazil hosted multiple rounds of deepwater auctions for pre-salt oil blocks in 2018 with an additional auction scheduled to be held in November 2019. 
The Subsea Oilfield
Deepwater successes have driven further innovation around the infrastructure required to produce and transport ashore the abundant resources that have been discovered. In shallower regions, once hydrocarbons are discovered, they are typically produced by installing a fixed platform over the well site onto which are installed all of the equipment and infrastructure necessary to produce the hydrocarbons and move them ashore through pipelines. Platforms also provide a locale from which well maintenance and similar activities can be performed. The size, pressures, temperatures and water depths of deepwater hydrocarbon deposits require enormous amounts of infrastructure to develop, produce and maintain their wells. These challenges have pushed the development of technologies to allow infrastructure to be placed directly onto the seafloor, as opposed to a fixed platform. The process of building out this subsea oilfield requires the use of vessels to transport infrastructure to location, install infrastructure to subsea points and inspect, repair and maintain it throughout the multi-decade life of the field. When hydrocarbons are brought to the surface, they are gathered from multiple subsea locations through pipelines to a single deepwater floating "top-side" production facility. These "top-side" production facilities take years to design, engineer, transport, install and, often, cost billions of dollars and represent a significant source of demand for vessel services during their installation and commissioning. More recently, deepwater producers have capitalized on their existing deepwater infrastructure to gain efficiencies through the use of so-called "tie-backs". A tie-back allows a deepwater well to be produced without having to install a new top-side facility by "tying the well back" to a near-by existing top-side facility accessible to the well location. Tie-backs require the installation of subsea infrastructure to connect the well to the remote "top-side" facility.

OSVs
OSVs primarily serve exploratory and developmental drilling rigs and production facilities and support offshore and subsea construction, installation, IRM and decommissioning activities. OSVs differ from other ships primarily due to their cargo-carrying flexibility and capacity. In addition to transporting deck cargo, such as pipe or drummed material and equipment, OSVs also transport liquid mud, potable and drilling water, diesel fuel, dry bulk cement and personnel between shore-bases and offshore rigs and production facilities. Deepwater environments require OSVs with capabilities that allow them to more effectively support drilling and related subsea construction projects that occur far from shore, in deepwater and increasingly at extreme well depths. In order to best serve these projects, we have designed our various classes of new generation vessels in a manner that seeks to maximize their liquid mud and dry bulk cement capacities, as well as their larger areas of open deck space. Deepwater operations also require vessels having dynamic positioning, or anchorless station-keeping capability, driven primarily by safety concerns that preclude vessels from physically mooring to floating deepwater installations. DP systems have experienced steady increases in technology over time with the highest DP rating currently being DP-3. The number following the DP notation generally indicates the degree of redundancy built into the vessel’s systems and the range of usefulness of the vessel in deepwater construction and subsea operations. Higher numbers represent greater DP capabilities. Today, deepwater drilling operations in the GoM overwhelmingly prefer a DP-2 notation and a vessel with 2,500 DWT capacity or greater. We consider these vessels to be high-spec new generation OSVs. Currently, 59 of our vessels are DP-2 and two are DP-3. The two remaining MPSVs contracted to be constructed under our fifth newbuild program are expected to be DP-2. Ultra-deepwater projects, which occur in waters of greater than 5,000 feet, are driving a need for DP-2 vessels with very large capacities. The distance of these projects from shore, together with their water and well depths dictate the use of massive volumes of bulk drilling materials and related supplies. The OSVs that have been delivered as part of our fifth OSV newbuild program are among the largest in the world. With DWT capacities of 5,500 DWT to 6,200 DWT, we believe these ultra high-spec vessels provide our ultra-deepwater drilling customers vessel solutions that help them to maximize efficiencies and improve the logistical challenges prevalent in their projects. 
Vessels that do not carry at least a DP-2 notation or have less than 2,500 DWT capacity typically operate in more shallow U.S. waters or in foreign locations in which DP-2 has not yet emerged as the dominant standard. Currently, 18 of our vessels are low-spec, comprising 13% of our fleet by DWT. The remaining 87% of our fleet is considered high-spec, including roughly 60% of our overall fleet that is ultra high-spec.

MPSVs
MPSVs also support the deepwater activities of the energy industry. MPSVs are distinguished from OSVs in that they are more specialized and often significantly larger vessels that are principally used for IRM activities, such as the subsea installation of well heads, risers, jumpers, umbilicals and other equipment placed on the seafloor. MPSVs are also utilized in connection with the setting of pipelines, the commissioning and de-commissioning of offshore facilities, the maintenance and/or repair of subsea equipment and the intervention of such wells, well testing and flow-back operations and other sophisticated deepwater operations. To perform these various functions, MPSVs are or can be equipped with a variety of lifting and deployment systems, including large capacity cranes, winches or reel systems, well intervention equipment, ROVs and accommodation facilities. The typical MPSV is outfitted with one or more deepwater cranes 
4

employing active heave compensation technology, one or more ROVs, a helideck and expansive accommodations for the offshore crew, including customer personnel. MPSVs can also be outfitted as a flotel to provide accommodations to large numbers of offshore construction and technical personnel involved in large-scale offshore projects, such as the commissioning of a floating offshore production facility. When in a flotel mode, the MPSV provides living quarters for third-party personnel, catering, laundry, medical services, recreational facilities, offices and as a helicopter heliport for the embarkation and disembarkation of offshore personnel. In addition, flotels coordinate and help to provide the facilities necessary for the offshore workers being accommodated to safely move from the vessel to other offshore structures being supported through the use of articulated gangways that allow personnel to "walk to work." Generally, MPSVs command higher dayrates than OSVs due to their significantly larger relative size and versatility, as well as higher construction and operating costs.
370 class MPSVs
We have devised MPSVs that, in addition to the array of services described above, are also capable of being utilized to transport deck or bulk cargoes in capacities exceeding most other new generation OSVs. We own and operate two proprietary 370 class DP-2 new generation MPSVs with such capabilities. These MPSVs have approximately double the deadweight and three times the liquid mud barrel-capacity of one of our 265 class new generation OSVs and more than four times the liquid mud barrel-capacity of one of our 240 class new generation OSVs. Moreover, with their large tanks, these MPSVs have assisted in large volume deepwater well testing and flow-back operations, as well as supporting large drilling operations in remote or harsh conditions. Both of our 370 class MPSVs uniquely have certifications by the USCG that permit Jones Act-qualified operations as a supply vessel, industrial/construction vessel and as a petroleum and chemical tanker under subchapters “L”, “I”, “D”, and “O”, respectively. We believe that these vessels are not only the largest supply vessels in the world, but are also the only vessels in the world to have received all four of these certifications. 
400 class and 310 class MPSVs
Until recently, due to a lack of Jones Act-qualified MPSVs, many customers would charter an OSV to carry equipment to location, which was then installed by a foreign flag MPSV. By eliminating the need for two vessels, we believe our customers will improve efficiencies and mitigate operational risks. Our Jones Act-qualified MPSVs are equipped with a heave-compensated knuckle-boom crane, helideck, accommodations for approximately 90-100 persons and are suitable for two or more work-class ROVs. Moreover, our Jones Act-qualified MPSVs are also equipped with below-deck cargo tanks, allowing them to expand their mission utility to include services more typically provided by OSVs.
We expect to take delivery of two 400 class MPSVs in the second and third quarters of 2020. Because our 400 class and 310 class MPSVs are Jones Act-qualified, we expect that they will enable our customers to transport equipment from shore to the installation site to be installed by the MPSV without needing to use a second (domestic) vessel for transport like foreign-flagged MPSVs are required to do. We believe that, once delivered, the 400 class MPSVs will be the largest and most capable Jones Act-qualified MPSVs available in the market.

Rendering of Planned HOS 400' Class MPSV
In April 2015, we also outfitted one of our 310 class OSVs that was placed in service under our ongoing newbuild program as a 310 class MPSV in flotel configuration. This U.S.-flagged, Jones Act-qualified MPSV includes a 35-ton knuckle-boom crane, a motion-compensated gangway and accommodations for 194 persons. Being Jones Act-qualified gives it mission flexibility that foreign flag flotels lack in the GoM.
430 class
We also operate the HOS Iron Horse and HOS Achiever, which are 430 class DP-3 new generation MPSVs. A DP-3 notation requires greater vessel and ship-system redundancies. DP-3 systems also include separate vessel compartments with fire-retardant walls for generators, prime movers, switchboards and most other DP components. These 430 class MPSVs are designed to handle a variety of global offshore energy applications, many of which are not dependent on the exploratory rig count. They are excellent platforms for those specialty services described above for our 400 and 310 class MPSVs with the exception of handling liquid cargoes. The HOS Iron Horse and the HOS Achiever are not U.S.-flagged vessels, however, they can engage in certain legally permissible operations in the U.S. that do not constitute coastwise trade. The HOS Achiever is currently configured as a flotel with accommodations for up to 270 personnel onboard, including the vessel's marine crew, hotel and catering staff. These accommodations allow this vessel to support the commissioning of deepwater installations around the world. Because flotel services do not typically involve the coastwise transportation of passengers, foreign-flag vessels, such as our 430 class MPSVs, can provide this service in the U.S. We recently placed the HOS Iron Horse into Mexican registry through our Mexican affiliate. We believe that the HOS Iron Horse is among the most sophisticated MPSVs in Mexican registry and will be a highly capable asset serving the growing Mexican market. 
We believe that our reputation for safety and technologically superior vessels, combined with our size and scale in certain core markets relative to our public company OSV peer group, enhance our ability to compete for work awarded by major oil companies, independent oil companies, national oil companies and the U.S. government, who are among our primary customers. These customers demand a high level of safety and technological advancements to meet the more stringent regulatory standards in the GoM. As our customers’ needs and requirements become more demanding, we expect that smaller vessel operators may struggle to meet these standards.

(1) | “DP-1,” “DP-2” and “DP-3” mean various classifications, or equivalent, of dynamic positioning systems on new generation vessels to automatically maintain a vessel’s position and heading through anchor-less station keeping.


(2) | These vessels are currently being constructed under our fifth OSV newbuild construction program with anticipated in-service dates during 2020.


(3) | These six vessels were converted into 240 class DP-2 OSVs as part of our 200 class OSV retrofit program in 2013. They were originally constructed and placed in service in their prior Super 200 class DP-1 configuration in 1999 or 2000 and were acquired by us in August 2007. 

We own long-term lease rights to two adjacent shore-base facilities located in Port Fourchon, Louisiana, named HOS Port. Port Fourchon’s proximity to the deepwater GoM provides a strategic logistical advantage for servicing drilling rigs, production facilities and other offshore installations and sites. We also utilize HOS Port as a shoreside facility for performing vessel maintenance, outfitting and other in-the-water shipyard activities. Developed as a multi-use facility, Port Fourchon has historically been a land base for offshore oil support services and the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, or LOOP. According to industry sources, Port Fourchon services nearly all deepwater rigs and almost half of all shallow water rigs in the GoM. The HOS Port facility has approximately five years remaining on its current lease and two additional five-year renewal options on each parcel. The combined acreage of HOS Port is approximately 60 acres with total waterfront bulkhead of nearly 3,000 linear feet. HOS Port not only supports our existing fleet and customers’ deepwater logistics requirements, but it underscores our long-term commitment to and our long-term outlook for the deepwater GoM.
Principal Markets 
OSVs and MPSVs operate worldwide, but are generally concentrated in relatively few offshore regions with high levels of exploration and development activity, such as the GoM, the North Sea, Southeast Asia, West Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. Our core geographic markets are the GoM, Mexico and Brazil. In these markets we provide services to several major integrated oil companies as well as mid-size and large independent oil companies with deepwater and ultra-deepwater activities and to national oil companies such as PEMEX and Petrobras. We also occasionally operate in select international markets, which have included the rest of Latin America, West Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Caribbean basin. We are often subcontracted by other oilfield service companies, both in the GoM and internationally, to provide a new generation fleet that enables them to render offshore oilfield services, such as well stimulation or other enhanced oil recovery activities, seismic surveying, diving and ROV operations, construction, installation, inspection, maintenance, repair and decommissioning services. We also provide a specialized application of our new generation OSVs for use by the United States military.

While there is some vessel migration between regions, key factors such as mobilization costs, vessel suitability and government statutes prohibiting foreign-flagged vessels from operating in certain waters, or coastwise cabotage laws such as the Jones Act, can limit the migration of OSVs into certain markets. Because some MPSVs are generally utilized for non-cargo operations, they are less limited by cabotage laws. Demand for OSVs, as evidenced by dayrates and utilization rates, is primarily related to offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity. Such activity is influenced by a number of factors, including the actual and forecasted price of oil and natural gas, the level of drilling permit activity, capital budgets of offshore exploration and production companies, and repair and maintenance needs in the deepwater oilfield. 
Offshore exploration and production activities are increasingly focused on deep wells (as defined by total well depth rather than water depth), whether on the Outer Continental Shelf or in the deepwater or ultra-deepwater. These types of wells require high-specification equipment, which has driven the recent and nearly completed newbuild cycle for drilling rigs and for OSVs. There were 32 floating rigs under construction or on order on February 13, 2019 and, as of that date, there were options outstanding to build seven additional floating rigs. In addition, on that date, there were 75 high-spec jack-up rigs under construction or on order worldwide, and there were options outstanding to build 13 additional high-spec jack-up rigs. Most, if not all, of these rigs were ordered prior to the downturn in oil prices that has persisted since late 2014. Consequently, the market for deepwater drilling rigs is expected to be over-supplied for the forseeable future. This oversupply of rigs may drive down the cost of contracting a drilling rig, with the result that more rigs may be employed, which could positively impact utilization of supply vessels. Each drilling rig working on deep-well projects typically requires more than one OSV to service it, and the number of OSVs required is dependent on many factors, including the type of activity being undertaken, the location of the rig and the size and capacity of the OSVs. During normal operating conditions, based on the historical data for the number of floating rigs and OSVs working, we believe that two to four OSVs per rig are required in the GoM and even more OSVs are necessary per rig in Brazil where greater logistical challenges result in longer vessel turnaround times to service drill sites. Typically, during the initial drilling stage, more OSVs are required to supply drilling mud, drill pipe and other materials than at later stages of the drilling cycle. In addition, generally more OSVs are required the farther a drilling rig is located from shore. Under normal weather conditions, the transit time to deepwater drilling rigs in the GoM and Brazil can typically range from six to 24 hours for a new generation vessel. In Brazil, transit time for a new generation vessel to some of the newer, more logistically remote deepwater drilling rig locations are more appropriately measured in days, not hours. In addition to drilling rig support, deepwater and ultra-deepwater exploration and production activities should result in the expansion of other specialty-service offerings for our vessels. These markets include subsea construction support, installation, IRM work, and life-of-field services, which include well-stimulation, workovers and decommissioning.
While Mexico has an active shallow water market, Mexico is now at the dawn of its deepwater efforts, which were enabled by the legal changes made in Mexico that opened its offshore areas to foreign investment. Mexico shares a deepwater border with the United States. Deepwater exploratory success on the U.S. side of that border, particularly in the “Perdido Belt” region suggests a high probability of similar success to be achieved on the Mexican side of the border. The first deepwater wells will be drilled in Mexico in 2019. 
Our charters are the product of either direct negotiation or a competitive proposal process, which evaluates vessel capability, availability and price. Our primary method of chartering in the GoM is through direct vessel negotiations with our customers on either a long-term or spot basis. In the international market, we sometimes charter through local entities in order to comply with cabotage or other local requirements. Some charters are solicited by customers through international vessel brokerage firms, which earn a commission that is customarily paid by the vessel owner. Our operations and management agreement with the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command was a sole source selection based upon certain capabilities unique to the Company that were developed while the applicable vessels were chartered to the Navy. All of our charters, whether long-term or spot, are priced on a dayrate basis, whereby for each day that the vessel is under contract to the customer, we earn a fixed amount of charter-hire for making the vessel available for the customer’s use. Some of the long-term contracts for our vessels and all of our government, including national oil company, charters contain early termination options in favor of the customer; however, some have fees designed to discourage early termination. Long-term charters sometimes contain provisions that permit us to increase our dayrates in order to be compensated for certain increased operational expenses or regulatory changes.
Competition 
The offshore support vessel industry is highly competitive. Competition primarily involves such factors as:

• | quality, capability and age of vessels;


• | quality, capability and nationality of the crew members;

9


• | ability to meet the customer’s schedule;


• | safety record, reputation, experience;


• | price and;


• | cabtoage laws.

Our three core markets, the U.S. GoM, Mexico and Brazil, all have strict cabotage laws that provide varying levels of insulation from foreign competition. While these laws vary in their provisions, generally they provide a barrier to entry to market participants that are short-term focused and unwilling to make a significant contribution of capital to the country being served.
Our high-spec OSVs are predominately U.S.-flagged vessels, which qualify them under the Jones Act to engage in domestic coastwise trade. The Jones Act restricts the ability of vessels that are foreign-built, foreign-owned, foreign-crewed or foreign-flagged from engaging in coastwise trade in the United States. The transportation services typically provided by OSVs constitute coastwise trade as defined by the Jones Act. See "Item 1A-Risk Factors" for a more detailed discussion of the Jones Act. Consequently, competition for our services in the GoM is largely restricted to other U.S. vessel owners and operators, both publicly and privately held. We believe that we operate the second largest fleet by DWT of new generation Jones Act-qualified OSVs in the United States. Internationally, our OSVs compete against other U.S. owners, as well as foreign owners and operators of OSVs. Some of our international competitors may benefit from a lower cost basis in their vessels, which are usually not constructed in U.S. shipyards, as well as from lower crewing costs and favorable tax regimes. While foreign vessel owners cannot engage in U.S. coastwise trade, some cabotage laws in other parts of the world permit temporary waivers for foreign vessels if domestic vessels are unavailable. We and other U.S. and foreign vessel owners have been able to obtain such waivers in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate.
Many of the services provided by MPSVs do not involve the transportation of merchandise and therefore are generally not considered coastwise trade under U.S. and foreign cabotage laws. Consequently, our MPSVs being constructed under our fifth newbuild program face competition from both foreign-flagged vessels and U.S.-flagged vessels for non-coastwise trade activities. In addition, since 2009, owners and operators of Jones-Act qualified MPSVs, such as ourselves, have challenged interpretations of the Jones Act issued by Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, that we believe erroneously allowed foreign MPSVs to be used in U.S. coastwise trade. In 2009 and again in 2017, CBP announced proposed modifications to or revocations of these interpretations, but subsequently withdrew both of those proposals. In 2017, trade organizations representing the owners and operators of Jones-Act qualified MPSVs, as well as U.S. shipyards that build them, sued CBP on account of the continued existence of Jones Act interpretations that are inconsistent with the statute. That suit is pending in Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, Captain Paul Radtke, et. al. v. U.S Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, et. al. Civil Action No. 17-2412. If successful, that litigation may reduce competition that our Jones-Act qualified MPSVs face from foreign MPSVs that are currently allowed by CBP to engage in coastwise trade. 
Competition in the MPSV industry is significantly affected by the particular capabilities of a vessel to meet the requirements of a customer’s project as well as price. While operating in the GoM, our MPSVs are required to utilize U.S. crews while foreign-owned vessels have historically been allowed to employ non-U.S. mariners, often from low-wage nations. U.S. crews are often more expensive than foreign crews. Also, foreign MPSV owners may have more favorable tax regimes than ours. Consequently, prices for foreign-owned MPSVs in the GoM are often lower than prices we can charge. Finally, some potential MPSV customers are also owners of MPSVs that will compete with our vessels. During the recent downturn, many foreign MPSVs have departed the GoM and most MPSVs currently operating in the GoM are Jones-Act qualified. If market conditions improve and the CBP letter rulings continue to allow foreign vessels to engage in coastwise trade, we might face significant price competition from the owners of these foreign vessels that enjoy lower manning and tax burdens. 
We continue to observe intense scrutiny by our customers on the safety and environmental management systems of vessel operators. As a consequence, we believe that deepwater customers are increasingly biased towards companies that have demonstrated a financial and operational commitment and capacity to employ such systems. We believe this trend will, over time, make it difficult for small enterprises to compete effectively in the deepwater OSV and MPSV markets. Additionally, we have observed less willingness by operators to utilize DP-1 vessels in deepwater operations in the GoM. This trend will likely result in the retirement of conventional non-DP vessels and a migration of DP-1 vessels to non-deepwater regions, such as the shelf, and certain international regions.
10

Although some of our principal competitors are larger or have more extensive international operations than we do, we believe that our operating capabilities and reputation for quality and safety enable us to compete effectively with other fleets in the market areas in which we operate or intend to operate. In particular, we believe that the relatively young age and advanced features of our OSVs and MPSVs provide us with a competitive advantage. The ages of our high-spec new generation OSVs range from two years to 20 years with a weighted-average fleet age, based on DWT, of seven years. In fact, approximately 91% of our active new generation OSVs have been placed in-service since January 1, 2008, giving our active fleet of OSVs an average age of six years. The average age of the industry’s conventional U.S.-flagged OSV fleet is over 35 years and the industry's domestic new generation OSV fleet is approximately 10 years. We believe that most of these older vessels are cold-stacked and many of them have been or will be permanently retired in the next few years due to physical and economic obsolescence. Worldwide competition for new generation vessels has been impacted in recent years by the increase in newbuild OSVs placed in-service to address greater customer interest in deep-well, deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling activity and the decline in industry activity due to low oil prices. Upon completion of our fifth OSV newbuild program, we expect to own a fleet of 76 Upstream vessels of which 83% will be DP-2 or DP-3 with a weighted-average fleet age, based on DWT, of 11 years in 2020.
Over the past five years, there have been several, and we expect further, formal and informal restructurings of owners and operators of OSVs and MPSVs that compete with us in the U.S. and globally. Two of our publicly traded domestic competitors emerged from Chapter 11 proceedings in 2017 and such competitors merged in late-2018. Companies that have undergone restructurings may have less debt and obligations associated with servicing their debt than companies that have not undergone restructurings. Additionally, fresh start accounting rules might also provide advantages that impact financial results that such restructured companies report. Because we have not initiated measures of this kind, we may face stiffer competition from restructured companies and may also report lower financial results relative to such restructured companies. We believe any advantages experienced by such competitors are short-term and limited in nature given the capital intensive nature of our business. Because all vessels must eventually be replaced, and shipyard costs have not and are not expected to decrease, even our competitors that have been restructured must generate returns sufficient to cover their cost of capital and fund eventual fleet replacement. 
Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. Our inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could impact our ability to manage, maintain and grow our business. In crewing our vessels, we require skilled employees who can perform physically demanding work and operate complex vessel systems. As the result of our vessel stacking strategy, we have reduced our mariner headcount significantly. When these stacked vessels return to service, we will need to hire and train additional mariners to operate such vessels. 
CUSTOMER DEPENDENCY
Our customers are generally limited to large, independent, integrated or nationally-owned energy companies. These firms are relatively few in number. The percentage of revenues attributable to a customer in any particular year depends on the level of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities undertaken by such customer, the availability and suitability of our vessels for the customer’s projects or products and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Military Sealift Command and Royal Dutch Shell plc (including worldwide affiliates) each accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. For a discussion of significant customers in prior periods, see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Environmental Laws and Regulations
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. The requirements of these laws and regulations have become more complex and stringent in recent years and may, in certain circumstances, impose strict, joint and several liability, rendering a company liable for environmental damages and remediation costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party. Aside from possible liability for damages and costs including natural resource damages associated with releases of oil or hazardous materials into the environment, such laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conditions caused by others or even acts of ours that were in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at the time such acts were performed. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders and suspension or termination of our operations. Moreover, it is possible that future changes in the environmental laws, regulations or enforcement policies that impose additional or more restrictive requirements or 
11

claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have performed what we consider to be appropriate environmental due diligence in connection with our operations and, where possible, we have taken all necessary steps to qualify for any applicable statutory defenses and limits of liability available under environmental regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations.
OPA 90 and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto amend and augment the oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act and impose a variety of duties and liabilities on “responsible parties” related to the prevention and/or reporting of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening U.S. Waters, including the Outer Continental Shelf or adjoining shorelines. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA 90 assigns liability to each responsible party for containment and oil removal costs, as well as a variety of public and private damages including the costs of responding to a release of oil, natural resource damages, damages for injury to, or economic losses resulting from, destruction of real or personal property of persons who own or lease such affected property. For any vessels, other than “tank vessels,” that are subject to OPA 90, the liability limits are the greater of $1,100 per gross ton or $939,800. A party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation. In addition, for an Outer Continental Shelf facility or a vessel carrying crude oil from a well situated on the Outer Continental Shelf, the limits apply only to liability for damages (e.g. natural resources, real or personal property, subsistence use, reserves, profits and earnings capacity, and public services damages). The owner or operator of such facility or vessel is liable for all removal costs resulting from a discharge or substantial threat of discharge without limits. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, the liability limits likewise do not apply and certain defenses may not be available. Moreover, OPA 90 imposes on responsible parties the need for proof of financial responsibility to cover at least some costs in a potential spill. As required, we have provided satisfactory evidence of financial responsibility to the USCG for all of our vessels over 300 tons. OPA 90 does not preempt state law, and states may impose liability on responsible parties and requirements for removal beyond what is provided in OPA 90. 
OPA 90 also imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including preparedness and prevention of oil spills and preparation of an oil spill response plan. We have engaged the Marine Spill Response Corporation to serve as our Oil Spill Removal Organization for purposes of providing oil spill removal resources and services for our operations in U.S. waters as required by the USCG. In addition, our Tank Vessel Response Plan and Non-Tank Vessel Response Plan have been approved by the USCG.
The Clean Water Act imposes strict controls on the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States. The Clean Water Act also provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharge of oil or other hazardous substances in reportable quantities and imposes liability for the costs of removal and remediation of an unauthorized discharge, including the costs of restoring damaged natural resources. Many states have laws that are analogous to the Clean Water Act and also require remediation of accidental releases of petroleum or other pollutants in reportable quantities. Our OSVs routinely transport diesel fuel to offshore rigs and platforms and also carry diesel fuel for their own use. Our OSVs also transport bulk chemical materials and liquid mud used in drilling activities, which contain oil and oil by-products. We maintain vessel response plans as required by the Clean Water Act to address potential oil and fuel spills.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, also known as “CERCLA” or “Superfund,” and similar laws impose liability for releases of hazardous substances, pollutants and contaminants into the environment. CERCLA currently exempts crude oil from the definition of hazardous substances for purposes of the statute, but our operations may involve the use or handling of other materials that may be classified as hazardous substances, pollutants and contaminants. CERCLA assigns strict, joint and several liability to each responsible party for response costs, as well as natural resource damages. Under CERCLA, responsible parties include not only owners and operators of vessels but also any person who arranged for the disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, and any person who accepted hazardous substances for transport to and selected the disposal or treatment facilities. Thus, we could be held liable for releases of hazardous substances that resulted from operations by third parties not under our control or for releases associated with practices performed by us or others that were standard in the industry at the time and in compliance with existing laws and regulations.
12

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulates the generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of onshore hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe treatment, storage and disposal of wastes. States having jurisdiction over our operations also have their own laws governing the generation and management of solid and hazardous waste. We generate non-hazardous wastes and small quantities of hazardous wastes in connection with routine operations. We believe that all of the wastes that we generate are handled in all material respects in compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state statutes.
The USCG's final Ballast Rule became effective on June 21, 2012, and the EPA renewed the Vessel General Permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System effective on December 19, 2013. In addition, the International Maritime Organization's, or IMO, International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments otherwise known as the Ballast Water Management Convention, or BWMC, became effective on September 8, 2017. The BWMC has similar standards to that of the USCG and EPA ballast water regulations. These regulations require all our existing vessels to meet certain standards pertaining to ballast water discharges. An exemption to certain compliance requirements in the U.S. is provided for vessels that operate within an isolated geographic region, as determined by the USCG and EPA, respectively. Most of our vessels operating in the GoM are exempt from the ballast water treatment requirements. However, for non-exempt vessels, ballast water treatment equipment may be required to be utilized on the vessel. The USCG has several approved ballast water treatment systems and, as a result, we will have to become compliant with ballast water treatment requirements that previously were waived in the U.S. Internationally, compliance with IMO’s BWMC is not expected to impact us until third quarter 2019 and thereafter, as implementation of these rules is based on the renewal of a vessel’s International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate after September 8, 2017. We have currently estimated the cost of compliance with either the USCG's Ballast Rule or the BWMC to be approximately $325,000 per vessel that is required to be fitted with a treatment system.  
The Clean Air Act, or CAA, passed by Congress in 1970 regulates all air pollutants resulting from industrial activities. The 1990 amendments to the CAA established jurisdiction of offshore regions. Proposed and existing facilities and vessels must prepare, as part of their development plans and reporting procedures, detailed emissions data to prove compliance with the CAA and obtain necessary permits. We believe that all of our facilities and vessels have obtained the necessary permits and are operating in all material respects in compliance with the CAA. The EPA also imposed emissions regulations affecting vessels that operate in the United States. The EPA’s decision to regulate “greenhouse gases” as a pollutant may result in further regulations and compliance costs.
Climate Change
Greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of international, national, regional, state and local attention. The EPA has adopted regulations under the CAA that require new and existing industrial facilities to obtain permits for carbon dioxide equivalent emissions above emission thresholds. In addition, the EPA adopted rules that mandate reporting of greenhouse gas data and other information by i) industrial sources, ii) suppliers of certain products, and iii) facilities that inject carbon dioxide underground. To the extent that these regulations may apply, we could be responsible for costs associated with complying with such regulations. Cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the European Union. Future treaty obligations, statutory or regulatory changes or new climate change legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions or other related legislative or regulatory enactments could have an effect in those industries that use significant amounts of petroleum products, which could potentially result in a reduction in demand for petroleum products and, consequently and indirectly, our offshore transportation and support services. We are currently unable to predict the manner or extent of any such effect. Furthermore, one of the asserted long-term physical effects of climate change may be an increase in the severity and frequency of adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes, which may increase our insurance costs or risk retention, limit insurance availability or reduce the areas in which, or the number of days during which, our customers would contract for our vessels in general and in the GoM in particular. We are currently unable to predict the manner or extent of any such effect.
EMPLOYEES
On December 31, 2018, we had 1,009 employees, including 817 operating personnel and 192 corporate, administrative and management personnel. Excluded from these personnel totals are 120 third-country nationals that we contracted to serve on our vessels as of December 31, 2018. These non-U.S. mariners are typically provided by international crewing agencies. With the exception of 182 employees located in Brazil and Mexico, none of our employees are represented by a union or employed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or similar arrangement. 
13

We have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages, and our management believes that we continue to experience good relations with our employees.

Foreign Operations
Operating in foreign markets presents many political, social and economic challenges. Although we take measures to mitigate these risks, they cannot be completely eliminated. See "Item—1A Risk Factors" for a further discussion of the risks of operating in foreign markets. 
SEASONALITY
Demand for our offshore support services is directly affected by the levels of offshore drilling and production activity. Budgets of many of our customers are based upon a calendar year, and demand for our services has historically been stronger in the second and third calendar quarters when allocated budgets are expended by our customers and weather conditions are more favorable for offshore activities. Many other factors, such as the expiration of drilling leases and the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, may affect this general trend in any particular year. In addition, we typically have an increase in demand for our vessels to survey and repair offshore infrastructure immediately following major hurricanes or other named storms in the GoM.
