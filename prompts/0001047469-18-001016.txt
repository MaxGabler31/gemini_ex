     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Overview 
         Innoviva, Inc. ("Innoviva", the "Company", the "Registrant" or "we" and other similar pronouns) is focused on bringing compelling medicines to patients in areas of unmet need by leveraging its significant expertise in the development, commercialization and financial management of bio-pharmaceuticals to maximize the potential of its respiratory assets partnered with Glaxo Group Limited ("GSK"), including RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® (fluticasone furoate/ vilanterol, "FF/VI"),ANORO® ELLIPTA® (umeclidinium bromide/ vilanterol, "UMEC/VI") and TRELEGY® ELLIPTA® (the combination FF/UMEC/VI). Under the Long-Acting Beta2 Agonist ("LABA") Collaboration Agreement, we are entitled to receive royalties from GSK on sales of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® as follows: 15% on the first $3.0 billion of annual global net sales and 5% for all annual global net sales above $3.0 billion and royalties from sales of ANORO ELLIPTA tier upward at a range from 6.5% to 10%. Innoviva is also entitled to 15% of royalty payments made by GSK under its agreements originally entered into with us, and since assigned to Theravance Respiratory Company, LLC ("TRC") , including TRELEGY® ELLIPTA® and any other product or combination of products that may be discovered or developed in the future under the LABA Collaboration Agreement and the Strategic Alliance Agreement with GSK (referred to herein collectively as the "GSK Agreements"), which have been assigned to TRC other than RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA®. 
         Our headquarters are located at 2000 Sierra Point Parkway, Suite 500, Brisbane, CA 94005. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in November 1996 under the name, Advanced Medicine, Inc., and began operations in May 1997. It later changed its name to Theravance, Inc. in April 2002. In June 2014, we spun-off our research and development operations. In January 2016, we rebranded and changed our name to Innoviva, Inc. 
   Our Strategy 
         Innoviva uniquely combines deep pharmaceutical industry expertise and strategic financial management with the goal of maximizing the commercial potential and royalties we receive from our partnered pharmaceutical products. By channeling our significant expertise in the key field of pharmaceutical medicines including product development, commercialization, and financial strategy, Innoviva seeks to become a partner in the delivery of compelling medicines that have the potential to improve the lives of patients by leveraging our unique industry knowledge and capabilities. This patient-centric approach is central to how Innoviva operates and collaborates with our partner to advance the availability of crucial medicines and treatments. Our corporate strategy is currently focused on the goal of maximizing stockholder value by, among other things, maximizing the potential value of our respiratory assets partnered with GSK and optimizing our overall corporate cost of capital, capital allocation and capital return to shareholders. 
   Our Relationship with GSK 
   LABA Collaboration 
         In November 2002, we entered into our LABA Collaboration Agreement with GSK to develop and commercialize once-daily products for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ("COPD") and asthma. The collaboration has developed three combination products:
 

 RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® (FF/VI) (BREO® ELLIPTA® is the proprietary name in the U.S.
and Canada and RELVAR® ELLIPTA® is the proprietary name outside the U.S. and 

 4

   

Canada),
a once-daily combination medicine consisting of a LABA, vilanterol (VI), and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), fluticasone furoate (FF), 


 ANORO® ELLIPTA® (UMEC/VI), a once-daily medicine combining a long-acting muscarinic antagonist ("LAMA"), umeclidinium
bromide (UMEC), with a LABA, VI, and 
 TRELEGY® ELLIPTA® (the combination FF/UMEC/VI), a once-daily combination medicine consisting of an ICS, LAMA and LABA. 

         As a result of the launch and approval of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA® in the U.S., Japan and Europe, in accordance with the LABA Collaboration Agreement, we paid milestone fees to GSK totaling $220.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Although we have no further milestone payment obligations to GSK pursuant to the LABA Collaboration Agreement, we continue to have ongoing commercialization activities under the LABA Collaboration Agreement, including participation in the joint steering committee and joint project committee that are expected to continue over the life of the agreements. The milestone fees paid to GSK were recognized as capitalized fees paid to a related party, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives commencing upon the commercial launch of the products. 
         We are entitled to receive royalties from GSK on sales of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® as follows: 15% on the first $3.0 billion of annual global net sales and 5% for all annual global net sales above $3.0 billion. For other products combined with a LABA from the LABA collaboration, such as ANORO® ELLIPTA®, royalties are upward tiering and range from 6.5% to 10%. 
         We are also entitled to 15% of royalty payments made by GSK under its agreements originally entered into with us, and since assigned to TRC in connection with the spin-off of Theravance Biopharma, Inc. ("Theravance Biopharma") in June 2014 (the "Spin-Off"), relating to TRELEGY® ELLIPTA®, which royalties are upward tiering and range from 6.5% to 10%. 
   2004 Strategic Alliance 
         In March 2004, we entered into the Strategic Alliance Agreement with GSK where GSK received an option to license exclusive development and commercialization rights to product candidates from certain of our discovery programs on pre-determined terms and on an exclusive, worldwide basis. In 2005, GSK licensed our MABA program for the treatment of COPD, and in October 2011, we and GSK expanded the MABA program by adding six additional Innoviva-discovered preclinical MABA compounds (the "Additional MABAs"). The development program has been funded in full by GSK as of December 31, 2017 and is in Phase II clinical studies stage. GSK is in the process of determining next steps for the program. As a result of the transactions effected by the Spin-Off, we are only entitled to receive 15% of any contingent payments and royalties payable by GSK from sales of products that may be developed under the Strategic Alliance Agreement, such as MABA, and MABA/FF, while Theravance Biopharma receives 85% of those same payments. 
   Common Stock owned by GSK 
         As of February 16, 2018, GSK beneficially owned approximately 31.4% of our outstanding common stock.

 Manufacturing 
         Manufacturing of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® (FF/VI), ANORO® ELLIPTA® (UMEC/VI) and TRELEGY® ELLIPTA® is performed by GSK. 
   Government Regulation 
         The development and commercialization of products and product candidates pursuant to the GSK Agreements are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any medicine must undergo rigorous preclinical studies and clinical studies and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA. Outside the United States, the ability to market a product depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In any country, the commercialization of medicines is permitted only if the appropriate regulatory authority is satisfied that our collaborative partner has presented adequate evidence of the safety, quality and efficacy of such medicines. 
         Once a product is approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or quality issues are identified after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations, and institute criminal prosecution. 
         If regulatory approval for a medicine is obtained, the clearance to market the product will be limited to those diseases and conditions for which the medicine is effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies and included in the medicine's labeling. Even if this regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed medicine, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and 
 6

   periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA ensures the quality of approved medicines by carefully monitoring manufacturers' compliance with its current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations. The cGMP regulations for drugs contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packaging of a medicine. The regulations are intended to make sure that a medicine is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a medicine, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the medicine or manufacturer, including costly recalls or withdrawal of the medicine from the market. 
         We and our collaborative partner are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with the development and commercialization of products and product candidates. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations, and institute criminal prosecution, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
         Outside the United States, our collaborative partner's ability to market partnered products will also depend on receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. Risks similar to those associated with FDA approval and continuing review described above exist with the regulatory approval processes in other countries. 
   Patents and Proprietary Rights 
         We and our collaborative partner will be able to protect our partnered technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that such technology is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Our success in the future will depend in part on us and our collaborative partner obtaining patent protection for our partnered products and product candidates. Accordingly, patents and other proprietary rights are essential elements of our business. 
         For proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our business that involve proprietary know-how and technology that is not covered by patent applications, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require all of our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. Where it is necessary to share our proprietary information or data with outside parties, our policy is to make available only that information and data required to accomplish the desired purpose and only pursuant to a duty of confidentiality on the part of those parties. 
         As of December 31, 2017, we owned 36 issued United States patents and 108 granted foreign patents, as well as additional pending United States patent applications and foreign patent applications. The claims in these various patents and patent applications are directed to compositions of matter, including claims covering product candidates, lead compounds and key intermediates, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use and processes for making our compounds. 
         United States issued patents and foreign patents generally expire 20 years after filing. Nevertheless, issued patents can be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products and threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Our patent position, similar to other companies in our industry, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. To maintain our proprietary position, we will need to obtain effective claims and enforce these claims once granted. It is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force only for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. Also, we do 
 7

   not know whether any of our patent applications will result in any issued patents or, if issued, whether the scope of the issued claims will be sufficient to protect our proprietary position. 
   Competition 
         We anticipate that RELVAR®/BREO®ELLIPTA®(FF/VI), ANORO® ELLIPTA® (UMEC/VI) and TRELEGY® ELLIPTA® (the combination FF/UMEC/VI), will compete with a number of approved bronchodilator drugs, including each other and drug candidates under development that are designed to treat asthma and COPD. These include but are not limited to:


 Advair®/Seretide Diskus®/HFA® (salmeterol and fluticasone proprionate as a combination)
marketed by GSK, 
 Symbicort® (formoterol and budesonide as a combination) marketed by AstraZeneca, 
 AirDuo Respiclick® (salmeterol and fluticasone proprionate), a non-substitutable generic version of Advair, marketed by TEVA, 
 Spiriva® Handihaler® and Spiriva Respimat® (tiotropium) marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, 
 Dulera® (formoterol and mometasone as a combination) marketed by Merck, 
 Tudorza® Pressair® (aclidinium) marketed by AstraZeneca and Seebri® Breezehaler®

glycopyrronium bromide) developed by Novartis and approved and launched in Europe and Japan in the year ended December 31, 2013 as a once-daily treatment for COPD. In the U.S., the product was
approved in October 2015 at a lower strength and as a twice-daily COPD treatment, and was licensed to Sunovion in December 2016, and launched in May 2017, 
 Stiolto (U.S.)/Spiolto (E.U.) Respimat® consists of the LAMA tiotropium combined with the LABA olodaterol, marketed by Boehringer
Ingelheim for the treatment of COPD, 
 Bevespi Aerosphere® (consisting of the LAMA glycopyrronium bromide and the LABA formoterol fumarate), marketed by AstraZeneca, 
 Duaklir® Genuair® (consisting of the LAMA aclidinium bromide and LABA formoterol fumarate), developed by AstraZeneca

           In addition, several firms are developing new formulations of Advair/Seretide (salmeterol /fluticasone proprionate) and Symbicort (formoterol fumerate/budesonide) which may be marketed as generics or branded generics relative to the existing products from GSK and AstraZeneca, respectively. All of these efforts represent potential competition for any of our partnered products. Efforts have intensified following the publication of FDA draft guidance for the approval of fully substitutable versions of Advair and Symbicort in late 2013 and mid-2015 respectively. Current examples of these products include the marketed products Duoresp/Biresp from Teva (generic Symbicort), AirFluSal Forspiro by Sandoz, Rolenium by Elpen and Sirdupla by Mylan (all generic versions of Seretide)) which are all available in a wide number of countries in the E.U. Numerous companies like Mylan N.V., Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC (Hikma), Novartis' Sandoz division and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (Teva) have publicly stated their intentions to bring generic forms of the ICS/LABA drug Advair®, when certain patents covering the Advair® delivery device expired in 2016. In March 2017, Mylan N.V. received a complete response letter from the FDA relating to its ANDA for fluticasone propionate 100, 250, 500 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg inhalation powder. In May 2017, Hikma announced that it received a complete response letter form the FDA relating to its ANDA for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, and in February 2018, Novartis announced that its generic division Sandoz, had received a complete response letter from FDA in response to its ANDA for a third fluticasone proprionate and salmeterol product. Lastly, Teva announced recently that the FDA approved two of their products for adolescent and adult patients with asthma, one of which is AirDuo RespiClick® (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder),a non-AB substitutable generic versions of Advair®. In general, these manufactures are required to conduct a restricted number of clinical efficacy, pharmacokinetic and device studies to demonstrate equivalence to Advair, per FDA's September 2013 Draft Guidance document. These studies are designed to demonstrate that the generic product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, exposure and clinical efficacy as the branded product. These generic equivalents, which must meet the same exacting quality standards as branded products, may be significantly less costly to bring to market, and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product and products that may compete with such branded product is typically lost to the generic product. In addition, in April 2016, the FDA issued draft guidelines documents covering Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol Trifenatate (FF/VI), the active ingredients used in RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®.
