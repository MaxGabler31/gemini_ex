Item 1. | Business

Overview
SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P., (the “Partnership,” “we,” “our” and “us”), primarily produces coke used in the blast furnace production of steel. Coke is a principal raw material in the blast furnace steelmaking process and is produced by heating metallurgical coal in a refractory oven, which releases certain volatile components from the coal, thus transforming the coal into coke.   We also provide handling and/or mixing services to steel, coke (including some of our and SunCoke Energy, Inc.'s (“SunCoke”) domestic cokemaking facilities), electric utility, coal producing and other manufacturing based customers. 
At December 31, 2018, we owned a 98 percent interest in Haverhill Coke Company LLC (“Haverhill”), Middletown Coke Company, LLC (“Middletown”) and Gateway Energy and Coke Company, LLC (“Granite City”) and SunCoke owned the remaining 2 percent interest in each of Haverhill, Middletown, and Granite City. The Partnership also owns a 100 percent interest in all of its logistics terminals. Through its subsidiary, SunCoke owned a 60.4 percent limited partnership interest in us and indirectly owned and controls our general partner, which holds a 2 percent general partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”).
On February 5, 2019, SunCoke and the Partnership announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement whereby SunCoke will acquire all outstanding common units of the Partnership not already owned by SunCoke in a stock-for-unit merger transaction (the “Simplification Transaction”). Pursuant to the terms of this agreement (“Merger Agreement”), Partnership unaffiliated common unitholders will receive 1.40 SunCoke common shares, plus a fraction of a SunCoke common share based on a ratio as further described in the Merger Agreement, for each Partnership common unit. On behalf of the Partnership and its public unitholders, the terms of the Simplification Transaction were negotiated, reviewed and approved by the conflicts committee of the Board of Directors of the Partnership's general partner, which consisted solely of independent directors. The transaction was approved by the Board of Directors of the general partner of the Partnership and the Board of Directors of SunCoke.  
Following completion of the Simplification Transaction, the Partnership will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of SunCoke, the Partnership's common units will cease to be publicly traded and the Partnership's IDRs will be eliminated.  The Simplification Transaction is expected to close late in the second quarter of 2019 or early in the third quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval by holders of a majority of the outstanding SunCoke common shares and Partnership common units, as well as customary regulatory approvals. SunCoke indirectly owns the majority of the Partnership common units, which is sufficient to approve the transaction on behalf of the holders of Partnership common units. 
We were organized in Delaware since July 2012, and are headquartered in Lisle, Illinois. We are a master limited partnership whose common units, representing limited partnership interests, were first listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) in January 2013 under the symbol “SXCP.”

Cokemaking Operations
The following table sets forth information about our cokemaking facilities:

Facility | Location | Coke Customer | Year ofStart Up | ContractExpiration | Number ofCoke Ovens | Annual Cokemaking NameplateCapacity(thousands of tons) | | Use of Waste Heat
Haverhill I | Franklin Furnace, Ohio | AM USA | 2005 | December 2020 | 100 | | 550 | | Process steam 
Haverhill II | Franklin Furnace, Ohio | AK Steel | 2008 | December 2021 | 100 | | 550 | | Power generation 
Middletown(1) | Middletown, Ohio | AK Steel | 2011 | December 2032 | 100 | | 550 | | Power generation 
Granite City | Granite City,Illinois | U.S. Steel | 2009 | December 2025 | 120 | | 650 | | Steam for power generation
Total | | | | | 420 | | 2,300 | | 


(1) | Cokemaking nameplate capacity represents stated capacity for the production of blast furnace coke. Middletown production and sales volumes are based on “run of oven” capacity, which includes both blast furnace coke and small coke. Using the stated capacity, Middletown nameplate capacity on a “run of oven” basis is approximately 578 thousand tons per year.

Together, we and SunCoke are the largest independent producer of high-quality coke in the Americas, as measured by tons of coke produced each year, and, in our opinion, SunCoke is the technological leader in the cokemaking process with over 55 years of coke production experience. SunCoke designed, developed, built, and currently owns and operates five cokemaking facilities in the United States (“U.S.”) (including, together with us, Haverhill, Middletown and Granite City) with an aggregate coke production capacity of approximately 4.2 million tons per year. Our cokemaking ovens have collective capacity to produce 2.3 million tons of coke annually and utilize efficient, modern heat recovery technology designed to combust the coal’s volatile components liberated during the cokemaking process and use the resulting heat to create steam or electricity for sale. This differs from by-product cokemaking, which seeks to repurpose the coal’s liberated volatile components for other uses.  SunCoke has constructed the only greenfield cokemaking facility in the U.S. in approximately 30 years and is the only North American coke producer that utilizes heat recovery technology in the cokemaking process. 
SunCoke's advanced heat recovery cokemaking process has numerous advantages over by-product cokemaking, including producing higher quality coke, using waste heat to generate derivative energy for resale and reducing the environmental impact. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 specifically directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to evaluate its heat recovery coke oven technology as a basis for establishing Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) standards for new cokemaking facilities. In addition, each of the four cokemaking facilities that SunCoke has built since 1990 has either met or exceeded the applicable Best Available Control Technology (“BACT”), or Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (“LAER”) standards, as applicable, set forth by the EPA for cokemaking facilities at that time. 
Our Granite City facility and the first phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill I, have steam generation facilities which use hot flue gas from the cokemaking process to produce steam for sale to customers pursuant to steam supply and purchase agreements. Granite City sells steam to United States Steel Corporation ("U.S. Steel") and Haverhill I provides steam, at minimal cost, to Altivia Petrochemicals, LLC. Our Middletown facility and the second phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill II, have cogeneration plants that use the hot flue gas created by the cokemaking process to generate electricity, which either is sold into the regional power market or to AK Steel Holding Corporation ("AK Steel") pursuant to energy sales agreements. 
Our core business model is predicated on providing steelmakers an alternative to investing capital in their own captive coke production facilities. We direct our marketing efforts principally towards steelmaking customers that require coke for use in their blast furnaces. Substantially all of our coke sales were made pursuant to long-term, take-or-pay agreements with AK Steel, ArcelorMittal USA LLC and/or its affiliates (“AM USA”) and U.S. Steel, three of the largest blast furnace steelmakers in North America, each of which individually accounts for greater than ten percent of our consolidated revenues. The take-or-pay provisions require us to produce the contracted volumes of coke and require our customers to purchase such volumes of coke up to a specified tonnage or pay the contract price for any tonnage they elect not to take. As a result, our ability to produce the contracted coke volume is a key determinant of our profitability. We generally do not have significant spot coke sales since our capacity is consumed by long-term contracts; accordingly, spot 
2

prices for coke do not generally affect our revenues. To date, our coke customers have satisfied their obligations under these agreements.
Our coke sales agreements have an average remaining term of approximately seven years and contain pass-through provisions for costs we incur in the cokemaking process, including coal and coal procurement costs subject to meeting contractual coal-to-coke yields, operating and maintenance costs, costs related to transportation of coke to our customers, taxes (other than income taxes) and costs associated with changes in regulation. When targeted coal-to-coke yields are achieved, the price of coal is not a significant determining factor in the profitability of these facilities, although it does affect our revenue and cost of sales for these facilities in approximately equal amounts. However, to the extent that the actual coal-to-coke yields are less than the contractual standard, we are responsible for the cost of the excess coal used in the cokemaking process. Conversely, to the extent our actual coal-to-coke yields are higher than the contractual standard, we realize gains. As coal prices increase, the benefits associated with favorable coal-to-coke yields also increase. These features of our coke sales agreements reduce our exposure to variability in coal price changes and inflationary costs over the remaining terms of these agreements.
Our coke prices include both an operating cost component and a fixed fee component. Operating costs under three of our coke sales agreements are passed through to the respective customers subject to an annually negotiated budget, in some cases subject to a cap annually adjusted for inflation, and we share any difference in costs from the budgeted amounts with our customers. Under our one other coke sales agreement, the operating cost component for our coke sales are fixed subject to an annual adjustment based on an inflation index. Accordingly, actual operating costs in excess of caps or budgets can have a significant impact on the profitability of all our domestic cokemaking facilities. The fixed fee component for each ton of coke sold to the customer is determined at the time the coke sales agreement is signed and is effective for the term of each sales agreement. The fixed fee is intended to provide an adequate return on invested capital and may differ based on investment levels and other considerations. The actual return on invested capital at any facility is based on the fixed fee per ton and favorable or unfavorable performance on pass-through cost items.
The coke sales agreement and energy sales agreement with AK Steel at our Haverhill facility are subject to early termination by AK Steel only if AK Steel meets both of the following two criteria: (1) AK Steel permanently shuts down operation of the iron producing portion of its Ashland Works Plant and (2) AK Steel has not acquired or begun construction of a new blast furnace in the U.S. to replace, in whole or in part, the Ashland Works Plant iron production capacity. If AK Steel were able to satisfy both criteria and chose to elect early termination, AK Steel must provide two years advance notice of the termination. During the two-year notice period, AK Steel must continue to perform in full under the terms of the coke sales agreement and energy sales agreement. On January 28, 2019, AK Steel announced its intention to permanently close its Ashland Works Plant by the end of 2019. Were the Ashland Works Plant to permanently shut down, we believe AK Steel has not and would not satisfy the second criterion. No other coke sales agreement has an early termination clause. 
While our steelmaking customers continue to operate in an environment that is challenged by global overcapacity, throughout 2018 they benefited from improved steel pricing, favorable trade policies, including U.S. steel tariffs signed into order during the first half of 2018, and solid end market demand. Imports of finished steel have decreased from 27 percent of U.S. steel consumption in 2017 to approximately 23 percent of U.S. steel consumption in 2018. U.S. Steel restarted both of the blast furnaces at its Granite City Works facility during 2018. 
Logistics Operations
Our logistics business consists of Convent Marine Terminal (“CMT”), Kanawha River Terminal (“KRT”) and SunCoke Lake Terminal (“Lake Terminal”). CMT, located in Convent, Louisiana, is one of the largest export terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast. CMT provides strategic access to seaborne markets for coal and other bulk materials. Supporting low-cost Illinois basin coal producers, the terminal provides loading and unloading services and has direct rail access and the current capability to transload 15 million tons annually due to its top of the line ship loader. The facility is supported by long-term contracts with volume commitments covering 10 million tons of its current capacity as well as 350 thousand liquid tons. The facility also serves other merchant business including aggregates (crushed stone) and petroleum coke. CMT's efficient barge unloading capabilities complement its rail and truck offerings and provide the terminal with the ability to transload and mix a significantly broader variety of materials, including coal, petroleum coke and other materials from barges at its dock. KRT is a leading metallurgical and thermal coal mixing and handling terminal service provider with collective capacity to mix and transload 25 million tons annually through its operations in Ceredo and Belle, West Virginia. Lake Terminal is located in East Chicago, Indiana and provides coal handling and mixing services to SunCoke's Indiana Harbor cokemaking operations.

Our logistics business has the collective capacity to mix and/or transload more than 40 million tons of coal and other aggregates annually and has storage capacity of approximately 3 million tons. Our terminals act as intermediaries between our customers and end users by providing transloading and mixing services. Materials are transported in numerous ways, including rail, truck, barge or ship. We do not take possession of materials handled but instead derive our revenue by providing handling and/or mixing services to our customers on a per ton basis. Revenues are recognized when services are provided as defined by customer contracts. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for our revenue recognition policies. Logistics services provided to our and SunCoke's domestic cokemaking facilities are provided under contracts with terms equivalent to those of an arm's-length transactions.
The financial performance of our logistics business is substantially dependent upon a limited number of customers. Our CMT customers are impacted by seaborne export market dynamics. Fluctuations in the benchmark price for coal delivery into northwest Europe, as referenced in the Argus/McCloskey's Coal Price Index report (“API2 index price”), as well as Newcastle index coal prices, as referenced in the Argus/McCloskey's Coal Price Index report (“API5 index price”), which reflect high-ash coal prices shipped from Australia, contribute to our customers' decisions to place tons into the export market and thus impact transloading volumes through our terminal facility. Our KRT terminals serve two primary domestic markets, metallurgical coal trade and thermal coal trade. Metallurgical markets are primarily impacted by steel prices and blast furnace operating levels whereas thermal markets are impacted by natural gas prices and electricity demand.
Strong API2 and API5 index prices continued to provide attractive economics for Illinois Basin and Northern Appalachian coal producers during 2018, which resulted in record volumes at our CMT facility. In 2018, the Mississippi River experienced near-historic water levels, which adversely impacted our barge unloading and our vessel loading activities at CMT. At KRT, domestic metallurgical and thermal market conditions and volumes were favorable in 2018 compared to 2017 due to increased demand from steel and utility customers. However, KRT volumes were suppressed during 2018 by rail availability due to strong demand for dry bulk products in the export market.
Seasonality
Our revenues in our cokemaking business and much of our logistics business are tied to long-term, take-or-pay contracts, and as such, are not seasonal. However, our cokemaking profitability is tied to coal-to-coke yields, which improve in drier weather. Accordingly, the coal-to-coke yield component of our profitability tends to be more favorable in the third quarter. Extreme weather conditions may also challenge our operating costs and production in the winter months for our domestic coke business. KRT service demand fluctuates due to changes in the domestic electricity markets. Excessively hot summer weather or cold winter weather may increase commercial and residential needs for heat or air conditioning, which in turn may increase electricity usage and the demand for thermal coal and, therefore, may favorably impact our logistics business.  Additionally, at CMT, service fluctuates with global thermal coal prices and end market demand. Activity is generally lower in the third quarter, typically due to lower European demand for heat. Operating costs at CMT are impacted by water levels on the Mississippi River, which are often higher in the spring months. 
Raw Materials
Metallurgical coal is the principal raw material for our cokemaking operations. All of the metallurgical coal used to produce coke at our cokemaking facilities is purchased from third-parties. We believe there is an adequate supply of metallurgical coal available in the U.S. and worldwide, and we have been able to supply coal to our cokemaking facilities without any significant disruption in coke production.
 Each ton of coke produced at our facilities requires approximately 1.4 tons of metallurgical coal. In 2018, we purchased approximately 3.4 million tons of metallurgical coal for our coke production. Coal is generally purchased on an annual basis via one-year contracts with costs passed through to our customers in accordance with the applicable coke sales agreements. Occasionally, shortfalls in deliveries by coal suppliers require us to procure supplemental coal volumes. As with typical annual purchases, the cost of these supplemental purchases is also generally passed through to our customers. In 2019, certain of our coal contracts contain an option to reduce our commitment by up to 15 percent at the Partnership's discretion. Most coal procurement decisions are made through a coal committee structure with customer participation. The customer can generally exercise an overriding vote on most coal procurement decisions.

Transportation and Freight
For inbound transportation of coal purchases, our cokemaking facilities have long-term transportation agreements and where necessary, coal-mixing agreements that run concurrently with the associated coke sales agreements. At our facilities with multiple transportation options, including rail and barge, we enter into short-term transportation contracts from year to year. 
For coke sales, the point of delivery varies by agreement and facility. The point of delivery for coke sales from the Haverhill cokemaking facilities is generally designated by the customer and shipments are made by railcar under a long-term transportation agreement. All delivery costs are passed through to the customers. At the Middletown and Granite City cokemaking facilities, coke is delivered primarily by a conveyor belt leading to the customer’s blast furnace. Most transportation and freight costs in our Logistics segment are paid by the customer directly to the transportation provider.
Research and Development and Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
As part of our omnibus agreement, SunCoke has granted us a royalty-free license to use the name “SunCoke” and related marks. Additionally, SunCoke has granted us a non-exclusive right to use all of SunCoke’s current and future cokemaking and related technology necessary to operate our business. SunCoke’s research and development program seeks to improve existing and develop promising new cokemaking technologies and enhance our heat recovery processes. Over the years, this program has produced numerous patents related to heat recovery coking design and operation, including patents for pollution control systems, oven pushing and charging mechanisms, oven flue gas control mechanisms and various others.
Competition
Cokemaking
The cokemaking business is highly competitive. Most of the world’s coke production capacity is owned by blast furnace steel companies utilizing by-product coke oven technology. The international merchant coke market is largely supplied by Chinese, Colombian and Ukrainian producers, among others, though it is difficult to maintain high quality coke in the export market, and when coupled with transportation costs, coke imports into the U.S. are often not economical.
The principal competitive factors affecting our cokemaking business include coke quality and price, reliability of supply, proximity to market, access to metallurgical coals and environmental performance. Our oven design and heat recovery technology play a role in all of these factors. Competitors include merchant coke producers as well as the cokemaking facilities owned and operated by blast furnace steel companies. 
In the past, there have been technologies which have sought to produce carbonaceous substitutes for coke in the blast furnace. While none have proven commercially viable thus far, we monitor the development of competing technologies carefully. We also monitor ferrous technologies, such as direct reduced iron production ("DRI"), as these could indirectly impact our blast furnace customers.  
We believe we are well-positioned to compete with other coke producers. Together with SunCoke, our Domestic Coke segment accounts for approximately 30 percent of the U.S. coke market capacity, excluding the capacity used to produce foundry coke. Current production from our cokemaking business is committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts. As a result, competition mainly affects our ability to obtain new contracts supporting development of additional cokemaking capacity, re-contracting existing facilities, as well as the sale of coke in the spot market. Our facilities were constructed using proven, industry-leading technology with many proprietary features allowing us to produce consistently higher quality coke than our competitors produce. Additionally, our technology allows us to produce heat that can be converted into steam or electrical power.
Logistics
The principal competitors of CMT are located on the U.S. Gulf Coast or U.S. East Coast. CMT is one of the largest export terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast and provides strategic access to seaborne markets for coal and other industrial materials. Additionally, CMT is the largest bulk material terminal in the lower U.S. with direct rail access on the Canadian National Railway. In 2018, CMT accounted for approximately 47 percent of U.S. thermal coal exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast and approximately 20 percent of total U.S. thermal coal exports. CMT has a state-of-the-art ship loader, which is the largest of its kind in the world. We believe this ship loader has the fastest loading rate available in the Gulf Region and should allow our customers to benefit from lower shipping costs. Additionally, CMT has a strategic alliance with a company that performs barge unloading services for the terminal, which provides CMT with the ability to transload and mix a significantly broader variety of materials.
5

Our KRT competitors are generally located within 100 miles of our operations. KRT has fully automated and computer-controlled mixing capabilities that mix coal to within two percent accuracy of customer specifications. KRT also has the ability to provide pad storage and has access to both CSX and Norfolk Southern rail lines as well as the Ohio River system. 
Lake Terminal provides coal handling and/or mixing services to SunCoke's Indiana Harbor cokemaking facility and therefore, does not have any competitors. 
Employees
We are managed and operated by the officers of our general partner. Our operating personnel are employees of our operating subsidiaries. Our operating subsidiaries had approximately 545 employees at December 31, 2018. Approximately 43 percent of our operating subsidiaries' employees are represented by the United Steelworkers union. Additionally, approximately 5 percent are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers. The labor agreements at KRT, Lake Terminal and Haverhill will expire on April 30, 2019, June 30, 2019 and November 1, 2019, respectively. We will negotiate the renewal of these agreements in 2019 and do not anticipate any work stoppages.
Safety
We are committed to maintaining a safe work environment and ensuring environmental compliance across all of our operations, as the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate are paramount. We employ practices and conduct training to help ensure that our employees work safely. Furthermore, we utilize processes for managing and monitoring safety and environmental performance.
We have consistently operated within the top quartiles for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s ("OSHA") recordable injury rates as measured and reported by the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute.
Legal and Regulatory Requirements 
The following discussion summarizes the principal legal and regulatory requirements that we believe may significantly affect us.
Permitting and Bonding

• | Permitting Process for Cokemaking Facilities. The permitting process for our cokemaking facilities is administered by the individual states. However, the main requirements for obtaining environmental construction and operating permits are found in the federal regulations. Once all requirements are satisfied, a state or local agency produces an initial draft permit. Generally, the facility reviews and comments on the initial draft. After accepting or rejecting the facility’s comments, the agency typically publishes a notice regarding the issuance of the draft permit and makes the permit and supporting documents available for public review and comment. A public hearing may be scheduled, and the EPA also has the opportunity to comment on the draft permit. The state or local agency responds to comments on the draft permit and may make revisions before a final construction permit is issued. A construction permit allows construction and commencement of operations of the facility and is generally valid for at least 18 months. Generally, construction commences during this period, while many states allow this period to be extended in certain situations. A facility's operating permit may be a state operating permit or a Title V operating permit. 


• | Air Quality. Our cokemaking facilities employ MACT standards designed to limit emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants. Specific MACT standards apply to door leaks, charging, oven pressure, pushing and quenching. Certain MACT standards for new cokemaking facilities were developed using test data from SunCoke's Jewell cokemaking facility located in Vansant, Virginia. Under applicable federal air quality regulations, permitting requirements may differ among facilities, depending upon whether the cokemaking facility will be located in an “attainment” area—i.e., one that meets the national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) for certain pollutants, or in a “non-attainment” or "unclassifiable" area. The status of an area may change over time as new NAAQS standards are adopted, resulting in an area change from one status or classification to another. In an attainment area, the facility must install air pollution control equipment or employ BACT. In a non-attainment area, the facility must install air pollution control equipment or employ procedures that meet LAER standards. LAER standards are the most stringent emission limitation achieved in practice by existing facilities. Unlike the BACT analysis, cost is generally not considered as part of a LAER analysis, and emissions in a non-attainment area must be offset by emission reductions obtained from other sources.

• | Stringent NAAQS for ambient nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide went into effect in 2010. In July 2013, the EPA identified or "designated" as non-attainment 29 areas in 16 states where monitored air quality showed violations of the 2010 1-hour SO2 NAAQS. In August 2015, the EPA finalized a new rulemaking to assist in implementation of the primary 1-hour SO2 NAAQS that requires either additional monitoring, or modeling of ambient air SO2 levels in various areas including where certain of our facilities are located. By July 2016, states subject to this rulemaking were required to provide the EPA with either a modeling approach using existing emissions data, or a plan to undertake ambient air monitoring for SO2 to begin in 2017. For states that choose to install ambient air SO2 monitoring stations, after three years of data has been collected, or sometime in 2020, the EPA will evaluate this data relative to the appropriate attainment designation for the areas under the 1-hour SO2 NAAQS. For states that chose to model, designations were made by December 2017. This rulemaking required certain of our facilities to undertake this ambient air monitoring or modeling. In December 2017, EPA issued a final designation of attainment or unclassifiable for all areas where our facilities are located. These designations mean that no future action is required for the facilities with respect to SO2 emissions at this time. However, legal challenges to these designations are possible. If redesignated, we may be required to install additional pollution controls and incur greater costs of operating at those of our facilities located in areas that EPA determines to be non-attainment with the 1-hour SO2 NAAQS based on its evaluation of this data. In 2012, a NAAQS for fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, went into effect. In January 2015, the area where the Granite City facility is located were designated unclassifiable for PM 2.5, and the area where the Haverhill facilities are located were designated unclassifiable/attainment for PM 2.5. In April 2015, the area where the Middletown facility is located was designated unclassifiable/attainment for PM 2.5. In November 2015, the EPA revised the existing NAAQS for ground level ozone to make the standard more stringent. In January 2018, EPA designated the area where the Haverhill facility is located as attainment/unclassifiable for ozone. In June 2018, EPA designated the areas where the Granite City and Middletown facilities are located as marginal nonattainment for ozone. Nonattainment designations under the new standards and any future more stringent standard for ozone have two impacts on permitting: (1) demonstrating compliance with the standard using dispersion modeling from a new facility will be more difficult; and (2) facilities operating in areas that become non-attainment areas due to the application of new standards may be required to install Reasonably Available Control Technology (“RACT”). A number of states have filed or joined suits to challenge the EPA’s new standard in court. While we are not able to determine the extent to which this new standard will impact our business at this time, it does have the potential to have a material impact on our operations and cost structure. 


• | The EPA adopted a rule in 2010 requiring a new facility that is a major source of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) to install equipment or employ BACT procedures. Currently, there is little information on what may be acceptable as BACT to control GHGs (primarily carbon dioxide from our facilities), but the database and additional guidance may be enhanced in the future.


• | Several states have additional requirements and standards other than those in the federal statutes and regulations. Many states have lists of “air toxics” with emission limitations determined by dispersion modeling. States also often have specific regulations that deal with visible emissions, odors and nuisance. In some cases, the state delegates some or all of these functions to local agencies.


• | Wastewater and Stormwater. Our heat recovery cokemaking technology does not produce wastewater as is typically associated with by-product cokemaking. Our cokemaking facilities, in some cases, have wastewater discharge and stormwater permits.


• | Waste. The primary solid waste product from our heat recovery cokemaking technology is calcium sulfate from flue gas desulfurization, which is generally taken to a solid waste landfill. The solid material from periodic cleaning of heat recovery steam generators has been disposed of as hazardous waste. On the whole, our heat recovery cokemaking process does not generate substantial quantities of hazardous waste.


• | U.S. Endangered Species Act. The U.S. Endangered Species Act and certain counterpart state regulations are intended to protect species whose populations allow for categorization as either endangered or threatened. With respect to permitting additional cokemaking facilities, protection of endangered or threatened species may have the effect of prohibiting, limiting the extent of or placing permitting conditions on soil removal, road building and other activities in areas containing the affected species. Based on the species that have been designated as endangered or threatened on our properties and the current application of these laws and regulations, we do not believe that they are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations.

• | Permitting Process for Certain Coal Terminals. Certain coal terminal operations in West Virginia and Kentucky have state-issued surface mining permits. The permit application process is initiated by collecting baseline data to adequately characterize, assess and model the pre-terminal environmental condition of the permit area, including soil and rock structures, cultural resources, soils, surface and ground water hydrology, and existing use. The permit application includes the coal terminal operations plan and reclamation plan, documents defining ownership and agreements pertaining to coal, minerals, oil and gas, water rights, rights of way and surface land and documents required by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s (“OSM’s”) Applicant Violator System. Once a permit application is submitted to the regulatory agency, it goes through a completeness and technical review before a public notice and comment period. Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance and the public has the right to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including through public hearings and intervention in the courts. SMCRA mine permits also take a significant period of time to be transferred. 


• | Bonding Requirements for Coal Terminals with Surface Mining Permits. Before a surface mining permit is issued in West Virginia, a mine operator must submit a bond or other form of financial security to guarantee the payment and performance of certain long-term mine closure and reclamation obligations. The costs of these bonds or other forms of financial security have fluctuated in recent years and the market terms of surety bonds related to surface mining permits generally have become less favorable to terminal operators and others with such permits. These and other changes in the terms of such bonds have been accompanied, at times, by a decrease in the number of companies willing to issue surety bonds. As of December 31, 2018, we have posted $0.3 million in surety bonds for our West Virginia and Louisiana coal terminal operations.

Regulation of Operations 

• | Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act and similar state laws and regulations affect our cokemaking operations, primarily through permitting and/or emissions control requirements relating to particulate matter (“PM”) and sulfur dioxide (“SO2”) and MACT standards. The Clean Air Act air emissions programs that may affect our operations, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to: the Acid Rain Program; NAAQS implementation for SO2, PM and nitrogen oxides (“NOx”), lead ozone and carbon monoxide; GHG rules; the Clean Air Interstate Rule; MACT emissions limits for hazardous air pollutants; the Regional Haze Program; New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”); and New Source Review. The Clean Air Act requires, among other things, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of various industry-specific MACT standards. Our cokemaking facilities are subject to two categories of MACT standards. The first category applies to pushing and quenching. The second category applies to emissions from charging and coke oven doors. The EPA is required to make a risk-based determination for pushing and quenching emissions and determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary. In 2016, EPA issued a request for information and testing to our cokemaking facilities and other companies as part of its residual risk and technology review of the MACT standard for pushing and quenching, and a technology review of the MACT standard for coke ovens and charging emissions. Testing was conducted by our cokemaking facilities in 2017, but the EPA has yet to publish or propose any residual risk standards; therefore, the impact of potential additional EPA regulation in this area cannot be estimated at this time.


• | Terminal Operations. Our terminal operations located along waterways and the Gulf of Mexico are also governed by permitting requirements under the CWA and CAA. These terminals are subject to U.S. Coast Guard regulations and comparable state statutes regarding design, installation, construction, and management. Many such terminals owned and operated by other entities that are also used to transport coal and petcoke, including for export, have been pursued by environmental interest groups for alleged violations of their permits’ requirements, or have seen their efforts to obtain or renew such permits contested by such groups. While we believe that our operations are in material compliance with these permits, it is possible that such challenges or claims will be made against our operations in the future. Moreover, our terminal operations may be affected by the impacts of additional regulation on petcoke or on the mining of all types of coal and use of thermal coal for fuel, which is restricting supply in some markets and may reduce the volumes of coal that our terminals manage. 


• | Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates the sales of electricity from our Haverhill and Middletown facilities, including the implementation of the Federal Power Act (“FPA”) and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (“PURPA”). The nature of the operations of the Haverhill and Middletown facilities makes each facility a qualifying facility under PURPA, which exempts the facilities and the Partnership from certain regulatory burdens, including the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (“PUHCA”), limited provisions of the FPA, and certain state laws and 

8

regulation. FERC has granted requests for authority to sell electricity from the Haverhill and Middletown facilities at market-based rates and the entities are subject to FERC’s market-based rate regulations, which require regular regulatory compliance filings.

• | Clean Water Act of 1972. Although our cokemaking facilities generally do not have water discharge permits, the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) may affect our operations by requiring water quality standards generally and through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”). Regular monitoring, reporting requirements and performance standards are requirements of NPDES permits that govern the discharge of pollutants into water. Discharges must either meet state water quality standards or be authorized through available regulatory processes such as alternate standards or variances. Additionally, through the CWA Section 401 certification program, states have approval authority over federal permits or licenses that might result in a discharge to their waters. Similarly, for permitting or any future water intake and/or discharge projects, our facilities could be subject to the Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 permitting process. 


• | Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We may generate wastes, including “solid” wastes and “hazardous” wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes, although certain mining and mineral beneficiation wastes and certain wastes derived from the combustion of coal currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The EPA has limited the disposal options for certain wastes that are designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA. Furthermore, it is possible that certain wastes generated by our operations that currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly management, disposal and clean-up requirements. Certain of our wastes are also subject to Department of Transportation regulations for shipping of materials.


• | Climate Change Legislation and Regulations. Our facilities are presently subject to the GHG reporting rule, which obligates us to report annual emissions of GHGs. The EPA also finalized a rule in 2010 requiring a new facility that is a major source of GHGs to install equipment or employ BACT procedures. In 2014, the Supreme Court issued an opinion holding that although EPA may not treat GHGs as a pollutant for the purpose of determining whether a source must obtain a PSD or Title V permit, EPA may continue to require GHG limitations in permits for sources classified as major based on their emission of other pollutants. Currently there is little information as to what may constitute BACT for GHG in most industries. Under this rule, certain modifications to our facilities could subject us to the additional permitting and other obligations relative to emissions of GHGs under the New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("NSR/PSD") and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act based on whether the facility triggered NSR/PSD because of emissions of another pollutant such as SO2, NOx, PM, ozone or lead. The EPA has engaged in rulemaking to regulate GHG emissions from existing and new coal fired power plants, and we expect continued legal challenges to this rulemaking and any future rulemaking for other industries. For instance, in August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan rules establishing carbon pollution standards for power plants. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the implementation of the Clean Power Plan before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (“D.C. Circuit”) issued a decision on the rule. By its terms, this stay will remain in effect throughout the pendency of the appeals process including at the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court through any certiorari petition that may be granted. In October 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan ("CPP") although the final outcome of this proposal and the pending litigation regarding the CPP is uncertain at this time. In connection with this proposed repeal, EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("ANPRM") in December 2017 regarding emission guidelines to limit GHG emissions from existing electric utility generating units. The ANPRM seeks comment regarding what the EPA should include in a potential new, existing source regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act that the EPA may propose. On October 9, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected any further challenges to the decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan. Although EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule as a replacement for the CPP in August 2018, the ACE rule has not yet been finalized. 

Currently, we do not anticipate these new or existing power plan GHG rules to impact our facilities. However, the impact current and future GHG-related legislation and regulations have on us will depend on a number of factors, including whether GHG sources in multiple sectors of the economy are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level, the degree to which GHG offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources decisions by states regarding the sources that will be subject to any implementing programs they may adopt and the indirect impact of carbon regulation on coal prices. We may not recover the costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements imposed on us from our customers due to limitations in our agreements. The imposition of a carbon tax or similar regulation could materially and adversely affect our 
9

revenues. Collectively, these requirements along with restrictions and requirements regarding the mining of all types of coal may reduce the volumes of coal that we manage and may ultimately adversely impact our customers. Depending on whether another rule is promulgated in the future, it could increase the demand for natural gas-generated electricity. 

• | Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (the “Miner Act”), has increased significantly the enforcement of safety and health standards and imposed safety and health standards on all aspects of mining operations. There also has been a significant increase in the dollar penalties assessed for citations issued.


• | Safety. Our facilities are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States Department of Labor and other agencies with standards designed to ensure worker safety. As noted above, we have consistently operated within the top quartiles for OSHA’s recordable injury rates as measured and reported by the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute. 


• | Security. CMT is subject to regulation by the U.S. Coast Guard pursuant to the Maritime Transportation Security Act. We have an internal inspection program designed to monitor and ensure compliance by CMT with these requirements. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of the facility. 

Reclamation and Remediation

• | Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as Superfund, and similar state laws, responsibility for the entire cost of clean-up of a contaminated site, as well as natural resource damages, can be imposed upon current or former site owners or operators, or upon any party who released one or more designated “hazardous substances” at the site, regardless of the lawfulness of the original activities that led to the contamination. In the course of our operations we may have generated and may generate wastes that fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. We also may be an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been released by previous owners or operators. Under CERCLA, we may be responsible for all or part of the costs of cleaning up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages. We also must comply with reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act.

Environmental Matters and Compliance 
Our failure to comply with the aforementioned requirements may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of clean-up and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations. The EPA and state regulators have issued Notices of Violations (“NOVs”) for the Haverhill and Granite City cokemaking facilities which stem from alleged violations of air operating permits for these facilities. SunCoke is working in a cooperative manner with the EPA and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to address the allegations and has entered into a consent decree in federal district court with these parties. The consent decree includes an approximately $2.2 million civil penalty payment that was paid by SunCoke in December 2014, as well as capital projects underway to improve the reliability of the energy recovery systems and enhance environmental performance at the Haverhill and Granite City facilities. We retained an aggregate of $119 million in proceeds from our initial public offering and subsequent dropdowns to comply with the expected terms of a consent decree at the Haverhill and Granite City cokemaking operations. SunCoke and the Partnership anticipate spending approximately $150 million to comply with these environmental remediation projects. Pursuant to the omnibus agreement, any amounts that we spend on these projects in excess of the $119 million will be reimbursed by SunCoke. Prior to our formation, SunCoke spent approximately $7 million related to these projects. The Partnership has spent approximately $131 million to date and expects to spend the remaining capital through the first half of 2019. SunCoke has reimbursed the Partnership approximately $20 million for the estimated additional spending beyond what has previously been funded.
Many other legal and administrative proceedings are pending or may be brought against us arising out of our current and past operations, including matters related to commercial and tax disputes, product liability, antitrust, employment claims, natural resource damage claims, premises-liability claims, allegations of exposures of third-parties to toxic substances and general environmental claims. Although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time, it is reasonably possible that some of them could be resolved unfavorably to us. Our management believes that any liabilities that may arise from such matters would not be material in relation to our business or our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows at December 31, 2018.

Under the terms of the omnibus agreement, SunCoke will indemnify us for certain environmental remediation projects costs. Please read “Part III. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence—Agreements Entered Into with Affiliates in Connection with our Initial Public Offering—Omnibus Agreement.”
IRS Final Regulations on Qualifying Income
Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") provides that a publicly-traded partnership will be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. However, if 90 percent or more of a partnership’s gross income for every taxable year it is publicly-traded consists of “qualifying income,” the publicly-traded partnership may continue to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
At the time of our initial public offering, in January 2013, we believed, and received a legal opinion to the effect, that income from our cokemaking operations would be treated as generating qualifying income under the Code.  The Partnership and counsel believed at the time that this view was based on the correct interpretation of the Code and the legislative history of the relevant Code section, and since that time continued to believe that income from its cokemaking operations is qualifying income.  
On January 19, 2017, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") issued qualifying income regulations (the "Final Regulations") on the treatment of income from natural resource activities of publicly traded partnerships as qualifying income for purposes of the Code.  The Final Regulations were published in the Federal Register on January 24, 2017, and apply to taxable years beginning after January 19, 2017.  Under the Final Regulations, the Partnership’s cokemaking operations have been excluded from the definition of activities that generate qualifying income. 
The Final Regulations provide that if a partnership’s income from non-qualifying operations “was qualifying income under the statute as reasonably interpreted,” then that partnership will have a transition period ending on the last day of the partnership’s taxable year that included the date that is ten years after the date the Final Regulations are published in the Federal Register (i.e., December 31, 2027), during which it can treat income from such activities as qualifying income. After conferring with outside counsel, the Partnership is of the view that its interpretation was reasonable in concluding that the Partnership’s income from cokemaking was qualifying income, and that the Partnership will benefit from the ten-year transition period. Subsequent to the transition period, certain cokemaking entities in the Partnership will become taxable as corporations. Also see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors" and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. 
The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including the Partnership, or an investment in its common units, may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively. Moreover, any such modification could make it more difficult or impossible for the Partnership to meet the exception which allows publicly traded partnerships that generate qualifying income to be treated as partnerships (rather than corporations) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, affect or cause us to change our business activities, or affect the tax consequences of an investment in its common units. For example, as discussed above, on January 24, 2017, Final Regulations were published in the Federal Register and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 19, 2017. The Final Regulations will likely affect the ability of partnerships to continue to qualify as a publicly traded partnership.
