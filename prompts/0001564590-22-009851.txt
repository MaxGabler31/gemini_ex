Item 1. BUSINESS
General
 Smith Micro develops software to simplify and enhance the mobile experience, providing solutions to leading wireless and cable service providers around the world. From protecting and securing the family digital lifestyle to providing powerful voice messaging capabilities, we enrich today’s connected lifestyles while creating new opportunities to engage consumers through their smartphones and consumer Internet of Things (“IoT”) devices. We believe our portfolio includes the most robust white-label family safety platform on the market, and a wide range of products for creating, sharing, and monetizing rich content, such as visual voice messaging, and retail display management.
 For 40 years, Smith Micro has provided software solutions for global businesses, evolving with the telecom industry, the internet and largely wireless environment. Today the Company develops wireless standards-based software that is extensible, interoperable, scalable, and proven to meet the most dynamic and demanding mobile environments. 
 We continue to innovate and evolve our business to respond to industry trends and maximize opportunities in emerging markets, such as digital lifestyle services and online safety, “Big Data” analytics, automotive telematics, and the consumer IOT marketplace. The key to our longevity, however, is not simply technological innovation, but our never-ending focus on listening to our customers, understanding their unique needs and the needs of their customers, and delivering value.
 
2021 was a historic year for Smith Micro as we completed the largest acquisition in company history by acquiring substantially all of the assets of the Family Safety Mobile Software business of Avast plc, and its subsidiaries, together with all of the outstanding membership interests of its then subsidiary, Location Labs LLC (the “Family Safety Mobile Business acquisition” or “Family Safety Mobile Business") for a base purchase price of $66 million. As part of the acquisition, we added several new wireless carriers to our family safety customer base, including two Tier 1 carriers in the United States. The acquisition, which closed in April 2021, further expanded our family safety user base, positioning Smith Micro as a leading family safety software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) provider globally while adding critical headcount in the U.S. and Europe. To fund the acquisition, we completed an underwritten follow-on public offering of common shares of Company stock. The offering closed on March 15, 2021, and resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $65.2 million prior to underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses.
 The Company was incorporated in California in November 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 5800 Corporate Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15237 and our telephone number is (412) 837-5300. Our website address is www.smithmicro.com, and we make our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Information contained on our website does not constitute a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Report”). Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “SMSI.”
 Business Segments
 We currently have one reportable operating segment: Wireless. 
 The wireless industry continues to undergo rapid change on all fronts as connected devices, mobile applications, and digital content are consumed by users who want information, high-speed wireless connectivity, and entertainment, anytime, anywhere. While most of us think about being “connected” in terms of computers, tablets and smartphones, the consumer IoT market is creating a world where almost anything can be connected to the wireless internet. Wearable devices such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, pet trackers and GPS locators, as well as smart home devices, are now commonplace, enabling people, pets, and things to be connected to the “Internet of Everything.” These devices have created an entire ecosystem of over-the-top (“OTT”) apps, while expanding how communication service providers can provide value to mobile consumers.

Although there are numerous business opportunities associated with pervasive connectivity, there are also numerous challenges, including:
  
• | The average age by which most children use smartphones and other connected devices continues to decrease. As such, parents and guardians must be proactive in managing and combating digital lifestyle issues such as excessive screen time, cyberbullying, and online safety;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As IoT use cases continue to proliferate and scale, management complexity, security and interoperability must be addressed efficiently and correctly;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mobile network operators (“MNO”) are being marginalized by messaging applications, and face growing competitive pressure from cable multiple system operators (“MSO”) and others deploying Wi-Fi networks to attract mobile users;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enterprises face increasing pressure to mobilize workforces, operations, and customer engagement, but lack the expertise and technologies needed to leverage mobile technology securely and cost-effectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ubiquity and convenience of e-commerce has created the need for consumer-facing brands to reimagine brick-and-mortar retail experiences; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The change in dynamics of both work, school and home life has led to an increased use of mobile devices for work, education and entertainment which has given rise to a new set of challenges and issues.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To address these challenges, Smith Micro offers the following solutions below. 
 Products
 SafePath® – Comprised of SafePath Family, SafePath IoT, and SafePath Home, the SafePath product suite provides comprehensive and easy-to-use tools to protect family digital lifestyles and manage connected devices both inside and outside the home. As a carrier-grade, white-label platform, SafePath empowers MNO and cable operators to bring to market full-featured, on-brand family safety solutions that provide in-demand services to mobile subscribers. These solutions include location tracking, parental controls, and driver safety functionality. Delivered to end-users as value-added services, SafePath-based solutions activate new revenue streams for MNO while helping to increase brand affinity and reduce subscriber churn.
 
CommSuite® – The CommSuite premium messaging platform helps mobile service providers deliver a next-generation voicemail experience to mobile subscribers, while monetizing a legacy cost-center. CommSuite Visual Voicemail (“VVM”) quickly and easily allows users to manage voice messages just like email or SMS with reply, forwarding and social sharing options. CommSuite also enables multi-language Voice-to-Text (“VTT”) transcription messaging, which facilitates convenient message consumption for users by reading versus listening. CommSuite is available to both postpaid premium subscribers as well as prepaid subscribers and is installed on millions of Android handsets in the United States.
 
ViewSpot® – Our retail display management platform provides wireless carriers and retailers with a way to bring powerful on-screen, interactive demos to life. These engaging demo experiences deliver consistent, secure, and targeted content that can be centrally managed and updated via ViewSpot Studio. With the feature set provided by ViewSpot, wireless carriers and other smartphone retailers can easily customize and optimize the content loops displayed on demo devices so that it resonates with in-store shoppers. Building on the touchless functionality added to ViewSpot in 2020, we enhanced the product on several fronts in 2021. Interactive demos created in ViewSpot can now be experienced on iOS devices as well as Android smart devices, which greatly increases the total addressable market for the platform. In addition, our engineering team continued to extend the functionality of the platform’s backend management dashboard during 2021 adding several in-demand features that enhance the utility and usability of ViewSpot as well as giving MNO greater control and autonomy over their content with Studio improvements.
 Legacy Graphics Business
 During fiscal 2021, we concluded the process that was started in 2019 of winding down our non-core product lines. This included the termination of e-commerce outlets and arrangements where consumers acquired animation software products.

Marketing and Sales Strategy
 Because of our broad product portfolio, deep integration and product development experience and flexible business models, we can quickly bring to market innovative solutions that support our customers’ needs, which creates new revenue opportunities and differentiates their products and services from their competitors.
 Our marketing and sales strategy is as follows:
 Leverage Operator Relationships. We continue to capitalize on our strong relationships with the world’s leading MNOs and MSOs. These customers serve as our primary distribution channel, providing access to hundreds of millions of end-users around the world.
 Focus on High-Growth Markets. We continue to focus on providing digital lifestyle solutions, analytics/Big Data solutions, premium messaging services, and visual retail content management solutions.  
 Expand our Customer Base. In addition to growing our business with current customers, we look to expand our MNO and MSO customers worldwide, as well as to expand into new partnerships as we extend the reach of our product platforms within the connected lifestyle ecosystem. 
Key Revenue Contributors
 In our Wireless business segment, we sell primarily to large MNO, cable operators, and original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), so there are a limited number of actual and potential customers for our current products, resulting in significant customer concentration. 
On April 1, 2020, Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”) and T-Mobile (US), Inc. (“T-Mobile”) completed their previously announced merger transaction, with the combined company continuing to operate as T-Mobile. In connection with the Sprint/T-Mobile merger, on July 1, 2020, the combined company divested certain assets to DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”), including Sprint’s Boost Mobile pre-paid wireless services business (“Boost”). A portion of our solutions sales to Sprint/T-Mobile has historically included sales to Boost. We are working toward expanding our strategic relationship with DISH and will aim to grow the number of subscribers – both at Boost and at DISH – using Smith Micro-powered value-added services. 
Customer Service and Technical Support
 We provide technical support and customer service through our online knowledge base, email, and live chat. OEM customers generally provide their own primary customer support functions and rely on us for support to their technical support personnel.
Product Development
 The software industry, particularly the wireless market, is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in technology and user needs. We work closely with industry groups and customers, both current and potential, to help us anticipate changes in technology and determine future customer needs. Software functionality depends upon the capabilities of the related hardware. Accordingly, we maintain engineering relationships with various hardware manufacturers, and we develop our software in tandem with their product development. Our engineering relationships with manufacturers, as well as with our major customers, are central to our product development efforts. We remain focused on the development and expansion of our technology, particularly in the wireless space.

Competition
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. These conditions create new opportunities for Smith Micro, as well as for our competitors, and we expect new competitors to continue to enter the market. We not only compete with other software vendors for new customer contracts, in an increasingly competitive and fast-moving market we also compete to acquire technology and qualified personnel.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the mobile software market include domain expertise, product features, usability, quality, price, customer service, speed to market and effective sales and marketing efforts. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. We also believe that the market for our software products has been and will continue to be characterized by significant price competition. A material reduction in the price we obtain for our products would negatively affect our profitability.
 Many of our existing and potential customers have the resources to develop products that compete directly with our products. As such, these customers may opt to discontinue the purchase of our products in the future. Our future performance is therefore substantially dependent upon the extent to which existing customers elect to purchase software from us rather than designing and developing their own software.
 Proprietary Rights and Licenses
 
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We have United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. We will continue to apply for such protections in the future as we deem necessary to protect our intellectual property. We seek to avoid unauthorized use and disclosure of our proprietary intellectual property by requiring employees and third parties with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code.
 
Our MNO/MSO customers license our products and/or or access our offerings through written agreements. Our customer agreements contain restrictions on reverse engineering, duplication, disclosure, and transfer of licensed software, and restrictions on access and use of SaaS.
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products and technology with the same functionality as our products and technology. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or take effective steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.
 Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 373 employees within the following departments: 281 in engineering and operations, 60 in sales and marketing, and 32 in management and administration. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relationships with our employees are good. Our strength and competitive advantage is – and always will be – people. We value the skills, strengths, and perspectives of our diverse team and will foster a participatory workplace that enables people to get involved in making decisions. The Company provides training and development opportunities to ensure that our employees are creative thinkers who are driven, focused, and interested in ever-changing technology.
