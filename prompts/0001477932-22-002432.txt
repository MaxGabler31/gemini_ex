Competition

In the uniform and related products segment, we will compete with many firms, including corporations with large divisions, many of these companies have great financial, technical or marketing resources, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition or larger customer bases than we do and may be able to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can. The nature and degree of competition varies with the customer and the market. Industry statistics are not available.

Competitive pricing may require us to reduce our future prices, which would impact future profitability or result in lost sales. Our competitors, many of whom have greater resources than we do, may be better able to withstand these price reductions and lost sales.

Seasonality

We do not have a seasonal business cycle.

Employees

We have no employees. Our officers and directors furnish their time to the development of the Company at no cost and intend to do whatever work is necessary in order to generate revenues. We do not foresee hiring any employees in the near future.
Research and Development

We have not incurred any research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.
