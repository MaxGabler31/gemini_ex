ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
General
 As used herein, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” “Thumzup™,” means Thumzup™ Media Corporation unless otherwise indicated. Thumzup™ operates in a single business segment which is social media marketing. Thumzup™ has a mobile iPhone and Android applications called “Thumzup™” that connects brands and people who use and love these brands. For the advertiser, Thumzup™ incentivizes real people to become content creators and post authentic valuable posts on social media about the advertiser and its products.
 
Thumzup™ was incorporated October 27, 2020, under the laws of the State of Nevada. Its headquarters are located in Carson City, Nevada. We have never been the subject of any bankruptcy or receivership. We have never engaged in any material reclassification, merger, or consolidation of the company. We have not acquired or disposed of any material amount of assets except in the normal course of business.
 
Thumzup™ seeks to capitalize on industry-wide gig economy and business democratization trends. Immense value and opportunity have been created through the democratization of ride sharing, hospitality finance and other industries. Thumzup™ tools are designed to facilitate this democratization trend for the consumer and the advertiser within the online advertising space.
 
Thumzup™ has built the technology to support an influencer and “gig” economy community around its Thumzup™ mobile app. This technology and community is designed to generate scalable authentic product posts and recommendations for advertisers on social media. It is designed to connect advertisers with individuals who are willing to tell their friends about the advertisers’ products online and offline.
 
Social Media Marketing Software Technology
 The Thumzup™ mobile app enables users, also referred to as creators, to select from brands advertising on the app and get paid to post about the advertiser on social media. Once the Thumzup™ creator selects the brand and takes a photo using the Thumzup™ app, the Thumzup™ app posts the photo and a caption to the creator’s social media accounts. The advertiser then reviews and approves the post for payment and the creator can cash out whenever they choose through popular digital payment systems. For the advertiser, the Thumzup™ system enables brands to get real people to promote their products to their friends, rather than displaying banner ads that people are tuning out. 
 The average American adult is estimated to spend 7.5 hours a day using digital media in 2020.[1] The amount of daily usage has increased every year since 2008 and we believe the recent rate of increase is accelerating.[2] We empower businesses that want to interact with these creators. We provide tools and data so they can increase consumer awareness and expand their customer bases.
 
In the past decade, social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and TikTok have achieved mass worldwide consumer acceptance and created hundreds of billions of dollars in shareholder value. This worldwide viral growth demonstrates that new social media platforms which present the right combination of experience and value, will attract creators who will invest significant amounts of time on compelling new platforms.

We are an early-stage entity building a new real-time platform to support the gig economy. We believe that acceptance of our app and revenue growth can be driven by our empowering everyday people to make money by posting about what they find to be enjoyable or attractive on social media. Thumzup™ in our view, is a conduit for advertisers to connect directly with consumers and we will need to secure enough advertisers to make our app an attractive platform for adoption, scalability and that the platform is interesting for the creators to return to on a regular basis. No assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve these results.
 
Our Industry—Influencer Marketing
 
We sell our services into the rapidly growing subset of online advertising called “influencer marketing”. As social media influencers become more plentiful and proven, advertising spending has increased in this space. Brands are estimated to spend up to $5 billion on influencer marketing by 2023[3]. Major brands recognize that having their happy customers post on social media is valuable.
 
Most existing paid influencer marketing platforms were designed for professional and semi-professional online personalities. Some of these platforms have expanded to accommodate what they term as micro-influencers, people with 5,000 to 30,000 social media followers. In our opinion, none of these influencer platforms has entered the public consciousness and found mass adoption.
 
Nielsen’s study “Global Trust In Advertising” found that 83% of respondents say they completely or somewhat trust the recommendations of friends and family.[4] Influencer marketing content delivers 11 times higher return on investment than traditional forms of digital marketing, and approximately 66% of marketing firms now deploy influencer marketing.[5] In Mary Meeker’s 2019 Internet Trends report she highlighted that the primary reason people chose to make new e-commerce purchases was that the product had been recommended by a friend.[6]
 

· | Accounts with over a million followers currently can earn $10,000 to $15,000 for a single sponsored post (depending on its engagement).[7] 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The key finding of our data is that as an influencer’s follower total rises, the rate of engagement (likes and comments) with followers decreases. Those with less than 1,000 followers, also referred to as nano influencers, generally received likes on their posts 8% of the time. Creators with over 10 million followers only received likes 1.6% of the time. There thus appears in our view a clear downward correlation between follower sizes and post likes. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Around 66% of marketers now use influencers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Nearly half of U.S. marketers plan to increase their influencer budgets. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | According to Chute, 64% of millennials recommend a product at least once a month through social media and one-third of millennials aspire to be or currently act as influencers.[8] 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

We have designed Thumzup™ “from the ground up” to make it easy for brands and service providers to activate people who are not professional influencers but who are passionate about the products, services, or establishments they enjoy or frequent and then are willing to relate those experiences to their friends and other social media followers. We have designed Thumzup™ app and advertiser dashboard with Apple-style simplicity and intuitive features to make participation by all individuals seamless with their existing use of social media.

Our first product—Thumzup™ app
 
We operate in a single business segment which is social media marketing. Our mobile iPhone and Android applications called “Thumzup™” connects brands, products and services to the people who use and love these brands, products and services. For advertisers, Thumzup™ activates real people to post real product reviews and testimonials on social media which may enhance brand awareness, reach targeted consumers more directly and effectively while driving profitable traffic to their goods and services.
 
We are building an influencer and gig economy community around our Thumzup™ mobile app that will generate scalable authentic product posts and recommendations for advertisers on social media and create a technology platform making person-to-person advertising easy, cost-effective, and scalable. Our app and advertiser dashboard is designed to connect advertisers with individuals who are willing to promote their products online and offline.
 
Social Media Marketing Software Technology
 
Our Services
 
The Thumzup™ mobile app enables creators to select from brands advertising on the app and get paid to post about the advertiser on social media. Once the Thumzup™ creator selects the brand and takes a photo using the Thumzup™ app, the Thumzup™ app posts the photo and a caption to the creator’s social media accounts. The advertiser then reviews and approves the post for payment and the creator can cash out whenever they choose through popular digital payment systems. For the advertiser, the Thumzup™ system enables brands to get real people to promote their products to their friends, rather than displaying banner ads that people are tuning out.
 
With the Thumzup™ app we are targeting and seeking to sign up everyday people and gig economy workers who like specific brands and present them with opportunities to be paid for posting about the brands on social media. We believe that our management team has the sales relationships, legal and technology expertise for our current level of development. We will need to add additional staff to rapidly grow our business.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own the copyrights to the source code for the Thumzup™ applications on the iPhone iOS and Android operating mobile operating systems used on the majority of mobile phone and tablet devices. We also own the copyrighted source code for the “backend” system that administrates the Thumzup™ app, tracks payments and advertising campaigns.
 
On April 13, 2021, Thumzup™ Media Corporation filed application 90642789 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to trademark "Thumzup™" and application 90642848 to trademark the Thumzup™ logo, with the latter published in the Trademark Official Gazette (TMOG) on March 1, 2022.

Business Model
 
Advertisers purchase a campaign on the Thumzup website. Once the advertiser approves a post for payment, the platform facilitates the payment to creators a monetary amount per screened post which may range from $ 1.00 to $1000.00. The Thumzup™ platform enables the advertiser to screen posts so that the advertiser only pays for posts that are commercially valuable and rewards creators for posts that have images and text that represent the advertiser in a positive manner.
Per Post Fee. Thumzup™ advertisers are charged a “Per Post Fee.” By way of illustration, an advertiser that buys 100,000 posts from Thumzup™, to pay out $10 per post to Thumzup™ creators, would purchase the posts for $12.00 each or $1,200,000.  The creators in this illustration would receive a total of $1,000,000 and Thumzup™ would retain $200,000 for its services.  The Thumzup™ platform would facilitate 100,000 posts for the advertiser from Thumzup™ creators sharing with their friends about their endorsed products on social media.

FTC disclosure
 
The Federal Trade Commission requires that paid posts are disclosed. Thumzup™ includes a disclosure in every post to comply with these FTC requirements.
 
Value Proposition
 
The Thumzup™ app is designed to generate scalable social media authentic social media content for advertisers. It is designed to connect advertisers with individuals who are willing to authentically promote their products online. We envision that many gig economy workers will be ideal candidates to become creators posting on Thumzup™. Imagine a gig economy driver waiting for their next fare who takes a moment to post about the good experience they had at their lunch spot where they are waiting. Imagine a gig economy worker on a laptop at a coffee shop doing a graphic design project from a gig economy site who takes a moment to post about the coffee shop where they are working on Thumzup™. We believe that Thumzup™ can readily provide extra income for this existing pool of gig economy workers. We believe these gig economy workers will be able to provide quality Thumzup™ posts on social media for which advertisers will be willing to pay.
Regulatory Compliance
 
       The Federal Trade Commission regulates and requires certain disclosures by social media influencers, specifying when disclosure is required, and how the disclosure should be presented. These rules are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations, 16 CFR Part 255. Specifically, the FTC requires that influencers disclose any financial, employment, personal, or family relationship with a brand. Influencers must disclose financial relationships and consideration paid including any money, discounted products or other benefits paid to the influencer. We plan on implementing compliance controls to ensure proper disclosure of all material relationships and consideration for an influencer’s endorsements.
 
We do not believe our compliance with existing FTC regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the company and its subsidiaries, for the current fiscal year and any other material future period
 

Thumzup™ App Workflow 


For direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands, a customer might get a postcard in the box upon receiving a purchase in the mail. A postcard would inform the customer about the opportunity to get cashback by sharing a picture of the purchase with friends on social media. If the creator takes a picture of the postcard, a link to download the Thumzup™ app will appear on the customer’s phone. The illustration to the left and those below are intended as examples only and will not necessarily correlate to a final version or an amount. Actual wording and amounts will depend on agreements with advertisers, products or brands seeking recommendations and other market factors as may be assessed by management.

For physical stores and restaurants, we offer signage to make patrons aware that they can be paid to tell their friends about their positive experience in the store or restaurant. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When creators open the Thumzup™ app on their phones, they will reach a welcome screen which establishes the idea that they can get paid to post about brands, services and places they like with the app.

The Main screen appears after a creator enters the unique code we sent. The main screen enables each creator to easily select brands, nearby restaurants, and stores that will pay the Thumzup™ creator to post to friends and other followers about products and places recommended by the creator on social media. The main screen has seven main areas where the creator can take action. There is what we call a “hamburger” menu in the upper left to access administrative functions and there is a balance due to the creator displayed on the upper right. Next, going down the screen there is a search bar, a map tool, a left to the right slider to select brands that will pay for posts, and an up and down slider to select locations nearby that will pay to post. The “hamburger” menu in the upper left gives the creator access to change bank or payment information, to link to social media, and to invite friends. The balance due to the creator number in the upper right has the total of monies pending and monies due but not yet transferred to the creator. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When creators select a brand or location tile from the main menu, the app enables them to take pictures of their enjoying the product or experience. The app then enables them to customize the caption that will be posted to social media. Once creators submit the pictures and captions, they get uploaded and displayed on the social media account of those creators. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thumzup™ inserts the tag required to disclose that the post is a paid promotion. If the advertiser, in this case at left, a fictional brand called “Wearclick” has chosen to offer a discount code to the Thumzup™ creator’s friends on social media, that discount code gets embedded in the post along with the offer. When the creator makes a new post, the post is reviewed by Thumzup™ on behalf of the client to assure that it meets community standards, does not include sexually explicit images or text, and that the post reflects the client in a commercially favorable light. For instance, if images are poorly lit or irrelevant to the brand, creators may be sent text messages to the creators giving them this feedback and explaining that the post is not due for payment. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


When creators want to receive the money they have earned they tap on the PayMe! Selection on the app menu. The app then pays the creator via online payment systems, such as Venmo or Paypal, the amount due from all screened posts made by that creator. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The mobile app enables the creator to search for brands they like that will pay them to post. This is useful so that Thumzup™ creators can easily discover brands they like to post about. The app pays creators to post about brands.

In our opinion, paid posts from happy customers posting about brands and services they like offer attractive, compelling values to advertisers and creators compared to traditional online advertising because those posts should yield higher response rates. To date our clients have paid more than 75 creators between $5.00 and $10.00 each to post about our initial advertisers. This post, for example, received about 40 “likes” from an Instagram creator who has about 900 followers. That is a 4.4percent response rate which is about eight times the average response rate of Instagram ads.[9]

The system provides advertisers with quality control by enabling the advertiser to review posts to make sure that the posts meet community standards and are commercially useful to the advertiser. This helps reduce the number of people who may try to game the system to otherwise not use it properly. Thumzup™ creators can opt-in to receive text message from brands. This opt-in opportunity is valuable to brands because text messages  have higher visibility to potential customers than emails.[10]
 
The system enables “campaign spend” to be limited by a total dollar amount determined by the advertiser. Once the posts that the advertiser has paid for in a campaign have been posted and approved for payment, the campaign expires and the advertiser incurs no additional cost until it chooses  to increase the amount. It also enables the advertiser to limit the number of posts made by an individual creator by day, week and month. We believe that this feature enables more efficient budgetary control while reducing unintended cost overruns. Creator. This feature may eliminate abuse or saturation by creators who post more than what may be commercially valuable to advertisers.
 

Financing Plan
 
In November 2020, we raised an aggregate of $215,000 through sales of senior secured convertible promissory notes to four investors. Since December 31, 2020 we have raised an additional $ $1,273,000 through the sale of our shares to accredited investors as that term is defined under federal securities laws . These funds have been used to build and beta test the Thumzup™ app and to cover operating costs including and other administrative costs and expenses.
 
During the year 2021 the company was pre-revenue and transitioned into beta testing. The Thumzup commercial launch is planned in 2022.
 
Competition
 Top 10 Influencer Marketing Platforms
 Market Research firm G2 ranks the top ten influencer marketing software companies as GRIN, #paid, CreatorIQ, Mavrck, Popular Pays, Tribe Dynamics, AspireIQ, Influenster, Traackr ,and Hivency.[11] This influencer marketing software space is focused on influencers who see themselves as professional influencers. None of these companies is building a platform designed to turn social media creators into micro-influencers in the manner that we seek to accomplish.
 
Rep is also an app that connects brands with influencers who are interesting in promoting brands. It is different from Thumzup because it is targeting people who consider themselves an influencer .
 
We do not currently know of a company that is seeking to build a community of everyday people and empowering them to post about brands that they love.
 
Nevertheless, the influencer marketing industry segments are rapidly evolving and competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future with the emergence of new technologies and market entrants. Our competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, substantially greater market share, established marketing relationships with, and access to, large existing advertisers and user bases, and substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. These companies may use these advantages to offer apps or other products similar to ours at a lower price, develop different products to compete with our current solutions and respond more quickly and effectively than we do to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements particularly across different cities and geographical regions. Certain competitors could also use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in markets in which we operate in the future. We believe our ability to compete successfully for users, content, and advertising and other customers depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:
 
●the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of our apps and services
 compared to those of our competitors;
 ●our ability, in and of itself as well as in comparison to the ability of our competitors, to develop
 new apps, other products and services and enhancements to then existing apps, products and
 services;
 ●our ad targeting and measurement capabilities, and those of our competitors;
 ●the size, composition and level of engagement of our app user communities relative to those
 of our competitors;
 ●our marketing and selling efforts, and those of our competitors;
 ●the pricing of our apps and services relative to those of our competitors;
 ●the actual or perceived return our customers receive from the deployment of our apps within
 our user communities relative to returns from our competitors; and
 ●our reputation and brand strength relative to our competitors.
 
Problems in the market that we solve
 
In March 2019, JetBlue Airways did a promotion where it offered free travel to people in exchange for posting about JetBlue on social media. The promotion was deemed not to be a success because many of the people reportedly deleted the posts after claiming the reward. JetBlue had no platform for tracking the influencers and holding them accountable.[12] The Thumzup™ platform can sample the creator’s Instagram feed to assure that the post is up before the payment is due.

Item 1 A. | Risk Factors. 
------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------

 An investment in our in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The risks described below include the principal material risks to our company or to investors that are known to our company. You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information contained in this Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. As a result, should a trading market develop, as to which no assurance can be given, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment. 
 
Risks Relating to Our Business
 
In addition to the other information in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating us and our business. This prospectus contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks and uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results could differ materially. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference.
 
There are risks associated with investing in companies such as ours who are primarily engaged in research and development. In addition to risks which could apply to any company or business, you should also consider the business we are in and the following:
 
We will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if not so available, may require us to delay, limit, reduce or cease our operations.
 
To date, we have relied primarily on debt and equity financing to carry on our business. We have limited financial resources, no operating cash flow and no assurance that sufficient funding will be available to us to fund our operating expenses and to further develop our business. We expect that our current cash position, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for less than the next twelve months. Unless we achieve profitability, as to which no assurance can be given, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations while we implement and execute our business plan. We currently do not have any contracts or commitments for additional financing. In addition, any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. There can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available on a timely basis or on terms that will be acceptable to us. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of operations or the further development of our business with the possible loss of such properties or assets. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fund our business or the expansion thereof, take advantage of strategic acquisitions or investment opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. Such inability to obtain additional financing when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and prospects.
 
We are an early stage pre-revenue company with an untested business plan which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results, creates uncertainty as to how investors will evaluate our prospects, and increases the risk that we will not be successful .   
         We were formed in October 2020 to develop and market the Thumzup app to advertisers and micro influencers. and have not yet established profitable operations or generated revenue. The Company realized a net loss from operations of $839,769 and $5,687 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have an untested business plan and it is uncertain how our new business model will affect investors’ perceptions and expectations with respect to our business and economic prospects. Our new business model may not be successful and no assurance can be given that we will ever generate positive cash flow.
   13

 

We expect to continue to incur losses from operations and negative cash flows, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a Going Concern.
 
We anticipate incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, we can obtain adequate advertiser support and user acceptance. Substantial additional financing will be needed to fund our development, marketing and sales activities and generally to commercialize our technology and develop brand support and user acceptance. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
We will seek to obtain additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance we will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing shareholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding shares of common stock. Issued debt securities may contain covenants and limit our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in our ability to raise capital, we believe that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Our independent registered public accounting firm’s reports for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 have raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a “going concern.”
 
Our independent registered public accounting firm indicated in its report on our audited financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A “going concern” opinion indicates that the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue as a going concern. Therefore, you should not rely on our balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to shareholders, in the event of liquidation. The presence of the going concern note to our financial statements may have an adverse impact on the relationships we are developing and plan to develop with third parties as we continue the commercialization of our products and could make it challenging and difficult for us to raise additional financing, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of your investment.
 
There is no assurance that we will ever be profitable or that debt or equity financing will be available to us in the amounts, on terms, and at times deemed acceptable to us, if at all. The issuance of additional equity securities by us would result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current shareholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. If we are unable to obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable to us, we may be unable to continue our business, as planned, and as a result may be required to scale back or cease operations for our business, the results of which would be that our shareholders would lose some or all of their investment. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

The outbreak of COVID-19 and its variants may have a significant negative impact on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.


The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the United States of America and the world, including in the primary regions in which we will operate. Many State Governors issued temporary Executive Orders in 2020, which continue to remain effective in many states that, among other stipulations, effectively limit in-person work activities for most industries and businesses having the effect of suspending or severely curtailing operations. Many of these orders
 are in the process of being lifted.   

Additionally, our liquidity could be negatively impacted if these conditions continue for a significant period of time. Capital and credit markets have been disrupted by the crisis and our ability to obtain any required financing is not guaranteed and largely dependent upon evolving market conditions and other factors. Depending on the continued impact of the crisis, further actions may be required to improve our cash position and capital structure.
 
The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak could ultimately impact our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.
 
We may not generate sufficient cash flows to cover our operating expenses.
 
As noted previously, we have incurred operating losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses as a result of expenses related to research and continued development of our technology, marketing expense, corporate general and administrative expenses and interest on the senior secured convertible promissory notes. Our limited capital resources and operations to date have been substantially funded through issuance of $215,000 in senior secured convertible promissory notes (in November 2020) and our subsequent issuances during 2021 and January 2022 of 724,500 shares of common stock at $1.00 per share for gross proceeds of $724,500 and 365,671 shares of common stock at $1.50 per share for gross proceeds of  $ $548,500.00.
 
The Company’s accumulated deficit was $862,942 and $5,687 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had total stockholders’ equity of $179,845 and although we had as of December 31, 2021, cash on hand of $424,445 the Company believes that these funds will not prove adequate beyond twelve months.
 
In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities or raise additional funds, we may be required to delay, reduce or severely curtail our operations or otherwise impede our on-going business efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects.
 
Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.
 
In the ordinary course of our business, we may collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information, proprietary business information of our customers, including, credit card and payment information, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. As such, we are subject to federal, state, provincial and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of data. Some jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data and our agreements with certain customers require us to notify them in the event of a security incident. Evolving regulations regarding personal data and personal information, in the European Union and elsewhere, including, but not limited to, the General Data Protection Regulation, which we refer to as GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, especially relating to classification of IP addresses, machine identification, location data and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business. Such laws and regulations require or may require us or our customers to implement privacy and security policies, permit consumers to access, correct or delete personal information stored or maintained by us or our customers, inform individuals of security incidents that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain consent to use personal information for specified purposes.
   15

 

We intend to take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect, use, store, and disclose, and we take steps to strengthen our security protocols and infrastructure, however, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. We also could be negatively impacted by software bugs or other technical malfunctions, as well as employee error or malfeasance. Advanced cyber-attacks can be multi-staged, unfold over time, and utilize a range of attack vectors with military-grade cyber weapons and proven techniques, such as spear phishing and social engineering, leaving organizations and users at high risk of being compromised. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, a disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, a loss of confidence in our business, early termination of our contracts and other business losses, indemnification of our customers, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, financial penalties, litigation, regulatory investigations and other significant liabilities, any of which could materially harm our business any of which could adversely affect our business, revenues, and competitive position.
 
We are dependent on third parties to, among other things, maintain our servers, provide the bandwidth necessary to transmit content, and utilize the content derived therefrom for the potential generation of revenues.
 
We depend on third-party service providers, suppliers, and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software, and operational support necessary to provide some of our products and services. Some of these third parties do not have a long operating history or may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and services we desire in the future. If demand exceeds these vendors’ capacity, or if these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner, at our specifications and at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products and services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability to serve our users. These events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract users, and have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results, and financial condition.
 
Because we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless and until they sell them.

We intend to retain a significant portion of any future earnings to finance the development, operation and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. The declaration, payment, and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless our board of directors determines to pay dividends, our shareholders will be required to look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. There can be no assurance that this appreciation will occur.
 
We are dependent on key personnel the loss of whose services would have a materially adverse effect on our business.
 
Our continued success will depend, to a significant extent, on the services of our executive management team, and key personnel. If one or more of these individuals were to leave, there is no guarantee we could replace them with qualified individuals in a timely or economically satisfactory manner or at all. The loss or unavailability of any or all of these individuals could harm our ability to execute our business plan, maintain important business relationships and complete certain product development initiatives, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.
 
We are a new company with a brief operating history, no revenue and an untested business plan which may not be accepted in the markets in which we intend to operate.
 We were formed in Nevada in October 2020. We will encounter difficulties, including unforeseen difficulties as an early-stage, pre-revenue company in establishing the credibility of our brand and commercial acceptability of our launched app.
   16

 

We will incur net losses in the foreseeable future if we are unable to anticipate market trends and match our service offerings to market patterns. Our business strategy is unproven, and we may not be successful in addressing early-stage challenges, such as establishing our position in the market and developing effective marketing of our Thumzup app. To implement our business plan, we will be required to obtain additional financing. We cannot guaranty that such additional financing will be available.
 Our prospects must be considered highly speculative, considering the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a new business with an unproven business plan, specifically the risks inherent in developmental stage companies seeking to have app users with limited number social media followers endorse products or services at a level that advertisers will seek to fund and support. We expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and, as a result, we expect significant net losses in the future which may materially affect our operationally viability. We cannot assure that we will be able to achieve positive cash flow operations or, if achieved, that positive cash can be maintained for any significant period, or at all.
 Although we believe that our business strategy addresses an underserved but significant niche of market segment utilizing an important users or consumers whom we define as “micro-influencers,” we may not be successful in the implementation of our business strategy or our business strategy may not be successful, either of which will impede our development and growth. Our business strategy involves attracting a large number of users who are active in social media and who are willing to make recommendations over our Thumzup app with advertisers who find our service cost effective in generating sales and market support. Our ability to implement this business strategy is dependent on our ability to:
 • predict concerns of advertisers;
 • identify and engage advertisers;
 • convince a large number of end users to adopt our Thumzup mobile application;
 • establish brand recognition and customer loyalty; and
 • manage growth in administrative overhead costs during the initiation of our business efforts.
 We do not know whether we will be able to successfully implement our business strategy or whether our business strategy will ultimately be successful. In assessing our ability to meet these challenges, a potential investor should consider our lack of operating history and brand recognition, our focus on nano-influencer users, management’s relative inexperience, the competitive conditions existing in our industry and general economic conditions and consumer discretionary spending habits. Our growth is largely dependent on our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Our revenue may be adversely affected if we fail to implement our business strategy or if we divert resources to a business strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful.
 We have not yet established brand identity and customer loyalty.
 
We believe that establishing and maintaining brand identity and brand loyalty is critical to attracting and retaining active users to our Thumzup app program. In order to attract Thumzup app users to our program quarter over quarter, we may need to spend substantial funds to create and maintain brand recognition among Thumzup app users. If our branding efforts are not successful, our ability to earn revenues and sustain our operations will be materially impaired.
 Promotion and enhancement of our Thumzup app will also depend on our success in consistently providing high-quality, ease of use, fun to share products or recommend services to our app users. Since we rely on technology partners to provide portions of the service to our customers, if our suppliers do not send accurate and timely data, or if our customers do not perceive the products we offer as attractive or superior, the value of our Thumzup brand could be harmed. Any brand impairment or dilution could decrease the attractiveness of Thumzup to one or more of these groups, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
   17

 

We cannot assure that our Thumzup app will be commercially accepted by advertisers and users accepted.
 
Anticipation of demand and market acceptance of service offerings are subject to a high level of uncertainty and challenges to implementation. The success of our service offerings primarily depends on the interest of end users joining our service, as to which we cannot assure you. In general, achieving market acceptance for our services will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds, the availability of which we cannot assure you, to create awareness and demand among customers. We have limited financial, personnel and other resources to undertake extensive marketing activities. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the acceptance of our app services or our ability to generate the revenues necessary to remain in business.
 A better financed competitor may enter our marketplace, cause our market share or acceptance rates to plummet and adversely affect our ability to sustain viable operations.
 
While platforms are in operation for professional or large-scale influencers, to our knowledge no other company is currently offering advertisers a scalable platform to activate everyday end-user micro-influencers who do not possess a large legion of followers. The success of our service offerings primarily depends on the interest of end users and advertisers joining our service, as opposed to a similar service offered by a competitor catering to celebrities or other large-scale influencers. If a direct competitor having greater human and cash resources enters our market targeting micro-influencers, our achieving market acceptance for the Thumzup app may require additional marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand among customers. We have limited financial, personnel and other resources to undertake additional marketing activities. Accordingly, we may be unable to compete, our operations may suffer and we may suffer greater losses.
 Although we may own various intellectual property rights, these rights may not provide us with any competitive advantage
 .
 We use “ThumzupTM” as a brand name however, we cannot assure you that the services we sell, or that our brand name will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, or that our assertions of intellectual property rights will be enforceable or provide protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable. Moreover, enforcement of intellectual property rights typically requires time-consuming and costly litigation, and we cannot assure that others will not independently develop substantially similar products.
 We cannot assure that our available funds will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through any period of twelve months.
 Our future financial results are uncertain and our operating results may fluctuate, due to, among other things, consumer trends, the impact of COVID and its variants on advertising budgets and app user activity, competition, and changing social media behaviors.
 As a result of our lack of operating history, we are unable to forecast market penetration or anticipated revenue and we have little historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses. We base our current and future expense levels on our operating plans and estimates of future expenses. Our expenses are dependent in large part upon expenses associated with our proposed marketing expenditures and related overhead expenses, and the costs of hiring and maintaining qualified personnel to carry out our respective services. Sales and operating results are difficult to forecast because they will depend on the growth of our customer base, changes in customer demands based on consumer trends, the degree of utilization of our advertising services as well as the mix of products and services sold by our advertisers.
 As a result, we may be unable to make accurate financial forecasts and adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. This inability could cause our net losses in a given quarter to be greater than expected and could further cause continuing greater losses quarter over quarter.
   18

 

Our ability to succeed will depend on the ability of our management to control costs. 
 
We have used reasonable commercial efforts to assess and predict costs and expenses based on the and restricted cash experience of our management. However, we have a limited operating history upon which to base predictions. Implementing our business plan may require more employees, equipment, supplies or other expenditure items than we have predicted. Similarly, the cost of compensating additional management, employees and consultants or other operating costs may be more than our estimates, which could result in sustained losses.
 Our officers and director do not devote full time to the affairs of the Company and could allocate their time and attention to other business ventures which may not benefit the Company .
 Our officers and directors may engage in other activities. Although there are none known to us, the potential for conflicts of interest exists among us and affiliated persons for future business opportunities that may not be presented to us. Our officers and directors may have conflicts of interests in allocating time, services, and functions between the other business ventures in which those persons may be or become involved. Our officers and directors, however, believe that we will have sufficient staff, consultants, employees, agents, contractors, and managers to adequately conduct our business.

Risks Related to our Common Stock 
 
An active trading market for our common stock may not develop.
 
Our common stock is currently listed on OTC Markets.com under the symbol (“TZUP“) but trades by appointment or not at all.  We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active public trading market or how liquid that public market may become. 
 
Additionally, because the initial quoted price of our common stock is likely to be less than $5.00 per share, our common stock may be considered a “penny stock,” and trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act.  Under this rule, broker/dealers who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements, including making an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receiving the purchaser’s written consent prior to the transaction.  Securities and Exchange Commission regulations also require additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a “penny stock,” including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks.  These requirements severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market because few brokers or dealers are likely to undertake these compliance activities and this limited liquidity will make it more difficult for an investor to sell his shares of our common stock in the secondary market should the investor wish to liquidate the investment.  In addition to the applicability of the penny stock rules, other risks associated with trading in penny stocks could also be price fluctuations and the lack of a liquid market.


Should an active market for our shares develop our stock price may be volatile and fluctuate widely, which could result in substantial losses to investors and litigation.
 
In addition to changes to market prices based on our results of operations and the factors discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, the market price of and trading volume for our common stock may change for a variety of reasons, not necessarily related to our actual operating performance.  The capital markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.  These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  In addition, the average daily trading volume of the securities of small companies can be very low, which may contribute to future volatility.  Factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly include:
 

● | the results of operating and financial performance and prospects of other companies in our industry; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | announcements of innovations, increased service capabilities, new or terminated customers or new, amended or terminated contracts by our competitors; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 19

 

● | the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | lack of securities analyst coverage or speculation in the press or investment community about us or market opportunities in the telecommunications services and staffing industry; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in government policies in the United States and, as our international business increases, in other foreign countries; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities or research analysts who track our common stock or failure of our actual results of operations to meet those expectations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any lawsuit involving us, our services or our products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | arrival and departure of key personnel; 
--+--------------------------------------------


● | sales of common stock by us, our investors or members of our management team; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural or man-made disasters. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors, as well as broader market and industry factors, may result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume of our common stock and could seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.  This may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares of our common stock, if at all.  In addition, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, shareholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company.  Our involvement in any class action suit or other legal proceeding could divert our senior management’s attention and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
The sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
 
Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through common stock offerings. Our principal executive officer and director beneficially owns a substantial percentage of our outstanding common stock and if were to sell a portion of the shares he holds, it could cause our stock price to decline.
 
 We are controlled by a small group of our existing shareholders, whose interests may differ from other shareholders. Our executive officers and directors will significantly influence our activities, and their interests may differ from your interests as a shareholder.
 
Our executive officers and directors will beneficially own a substantial percentage of our outstanding common stock.
 
Accordingly, these shareholders have had, and will continue to have, significant influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transaction or any other matter submitted for approval to our shareholders, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of our assets, director elections and other significant corporate actions.  They will also have significant influence in preventing or causing a change in control of our company.  In addition, without the consent of these shareholders, we could be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us.  The interests of these shareholders may differ from your interests as a shareholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other shareholders.
 
We are an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we expect to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, (i) being required to present only two years of audited financial statements and related financial disclosure, (ii) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (iii) extended transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards, (iv) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (v) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have taken, and in the future may take, advantage of these exemptions until such time that we are no longer an “emerging growth company.  As a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions.  If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.
   20

 

We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our annual revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30.


Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.
 
As a public company, we will also be required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in those internal controls. Such internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified three material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2021. The material weaknesses relate to (i) lack of proper segregation of duties across significant accounting cycles, (ii) lack of effective information technology security policies and control over access to key systems, and (iii) lack of precision in the design of internal control over financial reporting. Although we are making efforts to remediate these issues, we do not have the internal infrastructure and as a result these efforts may not be sufficient to avoid similar material weaknesses in the future. Designing and implementing internal controls over financial reporting will be time consuming, costly and complicated as we are a small organization with limited management resources. No assurance can be given that there are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of our financial controls.
 
If the material weaknesses in our internal controls are not fully remediated or if additional material weaknesses are identified, those material weaknesses could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations, reduce the market’s confidence in our financial statements, harm our stock price and subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.
 
For as long as we are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, or a non-accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, our auditors will not be required to attest as to our internal control over financial reporting. If we continue to identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or, once required, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could decrease. We could also become subject to stockholder or other third-party litigation as well as investigations by the securities exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and could result in fines, trading suspensions or other remedies.
 
If equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the market price of our common stock will likely decline.
 
The trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts, over whom we have no control, publish about us and our business.  We may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the market price for our common stock could decline. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, the market price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue unfavorable commentary, even if it is inaccurate, or cease publishing reports about us or our business.
