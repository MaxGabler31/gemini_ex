ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
Caladrius Biosciences, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Caladrius” or the “Company”) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of treatments and reversal of severe diseases. We are developing what are intended to be first-in-class therapeutics based on the characteristics of naturally occurring CD34+ cells and their ability to stimulate the growth of new microvasculature. Our technology is intended to leverage these cells to enable the body's natural repair mechanisms using formulations unique to each medical indication.
Our leadership team has decades of collective biopharmaceutical development experience. Our goal is to develop and commercialize products that address important unmet medical needs based on a broad and versatile portfolio of candidates. Our current product candidates include: 
•XOWNA® (CLBS16), the subject of both a completed positive Phase 2a study (ESCaPE-CMD) and an ongoing follow-on Phase 2b study (FREEDOM Trial) in the United States for the treatment of coronary microvascular dysfunction (“CMD”); 
•HONEDRA® (CLBS12), recipient of SAKIGAKE designation pursuant to which early conditional approval in Japan for the treatment of critical limb ischemia (“CLI”) and Buerger’s disease is being sought based on the current results of a clinical trial executed in Japan. CLBS12 was the recipient of orphan drug designation in March 2021 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for Buerger's disease; and 
•CLBS201, designed to assess the safety and efficacy of CD34+ cell therapy as a treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease related to type 2 diabetes (diabetic kidney disease or “DKD”).

Ischemic Repair (CD34 Cell Technology) 
The CD34+ cell was discovered as a result of the deliberate search for a cell capable of stimulating the development and/or repair of blood vessels. All tissues in the body maintain their function by replacing cells over time. In addition to the maintenance function, the body must also be capable of building new blood vessels after injury. A CD34+ cell is an endothelial progenitor cell that has the ability to stimulate new blood vessel formation at the level of the microvasculature. 
Our proprietary cell technology using autologous (a patient’s own naturally occurring) CD34+ cells has led to the development of therapeutic product candidates designed to address diseases and conditions caused by ischemia. Ischemia occurs when the supply of oxygenated blood to healthy tissue is restricted or reduced. Through the administration of CD34+ cells, we seek to promote the development and formation of new microvasculature and thereby increase blood flow to the impacted area. We believe that a number of conditions caused by underlying ischemic injury can be improved through our CD34+ cell technology including, but not limited to, Buerger's disease, CLI, CMD, and DKD.

XOWNA® for Treatment of Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction
In 2017, with the assistance of a $1.9 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (Award Number R44HL135889), we initiated our program for XOWNA® for the treatment of CMD, a disease that afflicts as many as 1.6 million patients in the United States alone, with no current targeted treatment options. That study, the ESCaPE-CMD Trial, was a Phase 2a proof-of-concept open label study that enrolled patients at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA. Those data showed a positive therapeutic effect with a statistically significant improvement in angina frequency, coronary flow reserve, Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Class and Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores, as well as an acceptable safety profile. The full data set from that study was presented at the SCAI 2020 Scientific Sessions Virtual Conference on May 14, 2020 by Dr. Timothy Henry, FACC, of the Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. In December 2020, we commenced enrollment in our Phase 2b FREEDOM Trial of XOWNA®, a double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of intracoronary artery delivery of autologous CD34+ cells in subjects with CMD and without obstructive coronary artery disease. While early enrollment proceeded to plan with the first patient treated in January 2021, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a general slowing of enrollment. Protocol amendments to the initial FREEDOM Trial protocol, as agreed to by the FDA, were implemented with the goal of enhancing breadth and speed of subject enrollment.
HONEDRA® for Treatment of Critical Limb Ischemia
Our randomized, open-label, registration-eligible study of HONEDRA® in Japan for the treatment of CLI and Buerger's disease has, to date, demonstrated positive trends in both safety and efficacy. The HONEDRA® study's enrollment, however, has been significantly curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact in Japan, including the States of Emergency in Japan that have persisted for much of the past 18 months. Due to the significant and continued operational and financial burden incurred as a result of these COVID-19 delays, coupled with the unpredictability of the timing of site enrollment re-initiation, we suspended further enrollment and are focusing our efforts on consummating a partnership for the product in Japan. Such a partnership may become the basis for the completion of development and registration of HONEDRA® in Japan and may include the completion of enrollment of the four remaining no-option CLI subjects stipulated in the original protocol, if necessary, and/or exploration of submitting the existing data to Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) under Japan's regenerative medicine regulations, which allow for conditional approval of innovative regenerative medicine products. Despite receipt from FDA in March 2021 of orphan designation in the United States for CLBS12 as a potential treatment for Buerger's disease, based on a response from the FDA in October 2021 regarding a development plan for U.S. registration, we have decided not to pursue U.S. development in Buerger's disease at this time.
CLBS201 for Treatment of Diabetic Kidney Disease
Progressive kidney failure is associated with attrition of the microcirculation of the kidney. Pre-clinical studies in kidney disease and injury models have demonstrated that protection or replenishment of the microcirculation results in improved kidney function. Based on these observations, we have elected to move forward with a Phase 1, open-label, proof-of-concept trial evaluating CLBS201 dosed via intra-renal artery injections in subjects with DKD. This protocol, as approved by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), is expected to include six subjects in total with the first two subjects sequentially dosed and followed for a two-week safety observation period. Clearance by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) overseeing the study will then permit the treatment of the next four patients, with all patients being followed for safety and therapeutic effect. A read-out of data will occur after the six-month follow-up visit for all patients. A key criterion for continued development of CLBS201 will be our ability to demonstrate a therapeutic effect that will make it competitive in the field of DKD treatment, i.e., kidney function regeneration, as indicated by increased glomerular filtration rate.
Additional Out-licensing Opportunities and Pipeline Diversification
Our broad intellectual property portfolio of cell therapy assets includes notable programs available for out-licensing in order to continue their clinical development. Our current long-term strategy focuses on advancing our therapies through development with the ultimate objective of obtaining market authorizations and entering commercialization, either alone or with partners, to provide treatment options to patients suffering from life-threatening medical conditions. We believe that we are well-positioned to realize potentially meaningful value increases within our own proprietary pipeline if we are successful in advancing our product candidates to their next significant development milestones.
In addition, we further desire to diversify our pipeline of development product candidates and are exploring a range of strategic transactions in furtherance of that goal. We have taken, and intend to continue to take, active steps to identify assets and/or companies for acquisition and/or partnership that would complement our current development programs and de-risk our overall development portfolio. Such assets potentially could target indications beyond cardiovascular disease as well as product categories outside of cell therapy. The range of possible transactions includes an acquisition, merger, business combination, in-license or other strategic transaction, any of which could result in the issuance of securities that could significantly dilute the 
Index

shares of our existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that this exploration of strategic alternatives will result in us entering into or completing any transaction or that such transaction, if completed, will add to shareholder value.
COVID-19 Considerations
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic, and the world's economies began to experience pronounced effects. Despite the FDA approval of multiple COVID-19 vaccines, there remains uncertainty around the extent and duration of disruption and any future related financial impact cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a universal work from home policy as well as stringent social distancing and other hygiene policies for employees when they must be in the office. Our clinical study of HONEDRA® in Japan has experienced significant delays in enrollment due to the States of Emergency in effect in Japan for most of 2020 and re-implemented from January 7, 2021 through March 21, 2021 covering Tokyo and other regions in response to an increased number of COVID-19 infections. Due to reported increases in COVID-19 cases and a low rate of vaccination in Japan, States of Emergency were renewed on April 25, 2021 through May 11, 2021 and then re-implemented in Tokyo from July 12, 2021 through September 30, 2021. With our expectation that COVID-19 in Japan would continue to impact negatively enrollment of patients in the HONEDRA® clinical trial, we have elected to suspend trial enrollment, seek a development partner and consult with the Japanese regulatory authorities regarding the submission of patient data already accrued. Our phase 2b trial of XOWNA® in the United States has also experienced delays in enrolling patients as a result of COVID-19.
THE FIELD OF CELL THERAPY
Regenerative medicine is defined as the process of replacing or regenerating human cells, tissues or organs to restore normal function. Among the categories of therapeutic technology platforms within this field are cell therapy, gene therapy, tissue engineering, tools, device diagnostics and aesthetic medicine. All living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates and then individual groups of cells differentiate (mature into complex cell types), thereby yielding the diversity of organs and organ systems in an adult organism. Cell therapy is a process that uses cells to prevent, treat or cure disease, or to regenerate damaged or aged tissue. Since the 1970s, bone marrow, blood and umbilical cord-derived stem cells have been used to restore bone marrow, as well as blood and immune system cells damaged by the chemotherapy and radiation historically used to treat many cancers. Notably, this approach holds certain curative potential for patients with otherwise fatal conditions.
There are two general classes of cell therapies: autologous and allogeneic. When cells are collected from a person (donor) and transplanted or used to develop a treatment solely for that same person (recipient or patient) with or without modification, the treatment paradigm is known as “autologous” cell therapy. For long-term repair of cardiovascular tissues, evidence indicates that the repair cells must remain in the target tissue for a period of time. Since autologous cells are not destroyed by the immune system, autologous cell therapy can be expected to result in long-term residence of the administered cells. When the donor and the recipient are not the same individual, however, the procedures are referred to as “allogeneic” cell therapy. 
Various cell therapies are in clinical development for an array of human diseases, including autoimmune, oncologic, cardiovascular, neurologic and orthopedic diseases, among other indications. While no assurances can be given regarding future medical developments, we believe that the field of cell therapy holds the promise to better the human experience and minimize or ameliorate the pain and suffering from many common and often life-threatening diseases. The FDA has been investing significant resources into policies and organizational changes to advance the cell and gene therapy fields in recent years through what the agency has labeled its “comprehensive regenerative medicine policy framework,” as first announced in late 2017 and incrementally developed since that time through various agency actions. 
TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES
Ischemic Repair (CD34+ Cell Technology)
Our CD34+ Cell Technology is an autologous cell platform technology with potential application to a broad array of ischemic conditions and we will seek to out-license the technology in geographies and/or indications in which we do not intend to pursue development ourselves. 
Intellectual Property Platform
Our developed and owned ischemic repair patent portfolio comprises the following:
a.Nine U.S. patents, three European Union (“EU”) patents (each filed in 5 individual countries) and ten other patents in Japan, Canada, Russia and Hong Kong;
b.Claims cover, inter alia, a pharmaceutical composition that contains a therapeutic concentration of non-expanded CD34+ stem cells that move in response to SDF-1 or VEGF, together with a stabilizing amount of serum, that can be delivered to repair an injury caused by vascular insufficiency;
Index

c.Issued and pending claims can be applied to a broad range of conditions caused by underlying ischemia, including acute myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial ischemia post-AMI, chronic heart failure, critical limb ischemia, and ischemic brain injury and DKD; 
d.One pending patent application in the United States; and
e.One pending patent application outside the United States.
Market Opportunity for CLI
In Japan, there are approximately 300,000 patients with CLI, of whom approximately 51,000 are not candidates for revascularization, together with an addressable population of approximately 560,000 patients in the EU and 300,000 in the United States. 
The field of cardiovascular cell therapy development is competitive. There are a number of companies that are developing cell-based therapies for cardiovascular diseases. These companies are utilizing a number of different therapeutic approaches in their development efforts. There are both autologous and allogeneic based competitive therapies that derive cells principally from four sources: fat, peripheral blood, cord blood, and bone marrow. HONEDRA® is an autologous therapy that derives its cells from the peripheral blood of the patient via apheresis. 
Market Opportunity for CMD
In the United States there is an addressable population of approximately 400,000 to 1,600,000 patients with CMD, while the addressable population is roughly 1,200,000 to 4,800,000 in the EU and between 43,000 and 166,000 in Japan.
Market Opportunity for DKD
In the United States, stage 3 and 4 DKD patients represent an addressable population of approximately 7,000,000 and there is an estimated addressable population of 12,000,000 patients in the EU.
SEASONALITY
We do not believe that our operations are seasonal in nature.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
The healthcare industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in the United States and abroad. Various governmental regulatory authorities, as well as private accreditation organizations, oversee and monitor the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the development, manufacture and delivery of health care products and services. The following is a general description of certain current laws and regulations that are relevant to our business:
Premarket Review and Approval of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products in the United States
In the United States, pharmaceutical and biological products, including cellular therapies, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products, intended for therapeutic uses. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (“PHS Act”). However, biological products that also meet the definition of “drugs” under the FD&C Act are also subject to regulation under FD&C Act provisions and to applicable provisions from two sets of FDA implementing regulations, those for biological products and those for drugs. Another distinction between pharmaceuticals and cellular therapies is that the PHS Act requires the submission of a Biological Licensing Application (“BLA”), rather than a New Drug Application (“NDA”), for market authorization of a cellular therapy candidate like ours. Generally, the application process and requirements for product approval under BLA is similar to those for an NDA, and the review process for biological products is associated with similar approval risks and application costs as for chemical entity drug products.
Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, withdrawal of an approval, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities. Under certain circumstances, individual members of company management may also be subject to civil or criminal penalties related to company violations of applicable legal requirements.
Index

An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new pharmaceutical or biological product in the United States typically must undertake the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's good laboratory practice or GLP regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which includes the detailed clinical protocol, which must take effect before human clinical trials can commence;
•approval of the clinical trial protocol and the sponsor's safeguards for human subjects by one or more institutional review boards, or “IRBs,” depending on the numbers of clinical sites and other features of the study design, before each clinical trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or “GCPs,” to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for each proposed indication for which FDA approval is sought;
•satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA, as appropriate;
•review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable, as determined by the FDA at its discretion;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with the regulations establishing current Good Manufacturing Practices, or “cGMPs,” and current Good Tissue Practices or “cGTPs” (if applicable), and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls used for the manufacture, processing and packing of the drug or biological product are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
•payment of applicable user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA or BLA. 
Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Moreover, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to initiate a clinical trial if the FDA raises concerns or questions about the design of the clinical trial or the preclinical or manufacturing information supporting it, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. After a trial is initiated, the FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and GCPs, which are meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors. In addition, sponsors of most clinical trials involving FDA regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry and results database managed by the National Institutes of Health called ClinicalTrials.gov. Registration information that must be submitted includes information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Failure to comply with applicable clinical trial registration or results reporting obligations can result in civil monetary penalties or the withholding of grant funds from a federally funded grantee.
Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or may be combined. Under certain circumstances, a fourth post-approval phase may be required.
•Phase 1: Trials in this phase are initially conducted in a limited population of healthy volunteers to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients, when the drug or biologic is too toxic to be ethically given to healthy individuals.
•Phase 2: These clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to determine the presence and approximate magnitude of therapeutic effect of the product for specific targeted indications and to identify 
Index

appropriate therapeutic dose and dose frequency as well as any corresponding additional possible adverse effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal or registration studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are typically undertaken in a larger patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple and geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug or biologic as a requirement for marketing authorization.
•Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor's agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA or BLA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily carry out additional trials post approval to gain more information about the drug or biologic.
Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA seeking approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. Under federal law, most NDA or BLA submissions are additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. The current fee for FY2022 is $3,117,218 (some small businesses may qualify for a waiver under certain circumstances) and an annual program fee, currently $369,413, must also be paid for each approved prescription drug or biological product. These fees are typically adjusted annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the Agency's threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. If the application is not sufficiently complete, the FDA may issue a Refusal to File, or RTF, letter, although the FDA may permit an applicant to correct certain easily correctable deficiencies in the NDA/BLA before filing without taking an official RTF action. Under certain NDA and BLA review performance goals to which the FDA has agreed, most applications for standard review of drug or biological products are reviewed within ten to twelve months, and most applications for priority review drugs or biologics are reviewed within six to eight months. If a sponsor submits a major amendment to a filed NDA or BLA at any time during the review cycle, the FDA may extend these reviews by three months although only one such extension is permitted during a review cycle. Priority review can be applied to drugs or biologics that, in the FDA's determination, offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment for a disease or condition for which no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited to products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to currently approved products. Priority review requests must be submitted in conjunction with the original NDA/BLA for which the sponsor is seeking the designation, and the FDA decision will be made in conjunction with its official action to file the application and begin the substantive review process.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. These pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with an NDA or BLA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with applicable cGMP and cGTP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the drug or biological product within required specifications and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug or biologic is safe and effective for the proposed indication.
The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products, or drug or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but the FDA will carefully consider them.
After the FDA fully evaluates the NDA or BLA and the relevant manufacturing facilities, the FDA will issue either an approval/licensure letter or a complete response letter (“CRL”). A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmitted NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions within two or six months, depending on the type of information being provided to address the deficiencies in the CRL. Even with the submission of this additional information, 
Index

however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a drug or biological product for marketing in the United States, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product; require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling; require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval; require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization; or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, such as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or “REMS,” which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA also may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or patient populations, making certain types of manufacturing changes or seeking to make additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
One potential condition of approval is that the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.  To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS requirements are tailored to the specific risk/benefit profile of a drug and can include requirements such as medication guides for patients, detailed communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or “ETASU.” ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, restricted distribution, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS as a condition of approval or may add such a requirement at any point post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS and the specific components that are involved can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve an NDA without a REMS, if required.
Expedited Review Programs (Fast Track, Breakthrough, RMAT) and Accelerated Approval Pathways
The FDA is authorized to facilitate the development and expedite the review of certain drugs or biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track Program, the sponsor of an IND for a drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. In addition to other benefits such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. The FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application, however, does not begin until the last section of the NDA/BLA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Separately, under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients beyond existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug such that accelerated approval is also referred to as U.S. “conditional” approval. Products granted accelerated approval also are subject to additional requirements for the pre-dissemination review by the FDA of proposed promotional materials both during the NDA review process and for 120 days after marketing approval.
In addition to the above, the FDA may designate an investigational product as a Breakthrough Therapy or as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”), depending on the type of investigational product and its ability to meet applicable eligibility criteria. Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and 
Index

review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). The RMAT designation requires similar eligibility criteria to be met, but it is available only to cell therapies, tissue therapies, and other products that meet the statutory definition of a “regenerative medicine therapy.” Specifically, a biological product is eligible for RMAT designation if: (a) the product candidate is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined in the FD&C Act as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under the PHS Act (that is, excluding those biological products that are not also regulated as “drugs” under the FD&C Act); (b) the product candidate is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (c) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Both Breakthrough Therapy and RMAT designations are intended to help accelerate product development by allowing more frequent interactions with the FDA and receiving intensive FDA guidance on efficient drug development.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric trial plans prior to the assessment data, and those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric trial or trials the applicant plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers or deferrals for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although the FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in PREA by announcing that it does not intend to grant any additional orphan drug designations for rare pediatric subpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides approved NDA and BLA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity that attaches to the end of all existing marketing exclusivities and patents for the drug or biologic. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug or biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA's request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a candidate as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States) Orphan drug designation must be requested by an applicant before submitting an NDA or BLA for the relevant drug candidate. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the FDA will publicly disclose the generic identity of the drug candidate and its potential orphan use. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances comprising methods by which a second sponsor can demonstrate clinical superiority of its drug in comparison to the first approved orphan drug. Regardless of the orphan drug designation, a competitor may receive FDA approval for a different product (i.e., a different therapeutic agent from the orphan drug) for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product (i.e., the same therapeutic agent as the orphan drug) but for a different indication. If a designated orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was described in its orphan drug designation request, it may not be entitled to exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation, the sponsor receives a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee and is eligible for tax credits for certain research (although the amount of this potential tax credit was decreased from 50% to 25% of qualified clinical testing expenses with the 2017 overhaul of the U.S. Tax Code, effective in 2018).
Post-Approval Requirements
Index

Drugs and biological products manufactured, marketed or distributed pursuant to FDA approval decisions are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to FDA review and approval before they can be implemented. There also are continuing, annual program fee requirements for any marketed, approved prescription products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture of approved drugs are required to register their facilities with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP/cGTP requirements. Prescription drug distribution facilities are also subject to state licensure, including inspections, by the relevant local regulatory authority. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved drug or biologic are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP or cGTP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and others involved in the product’s manufacturing process. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP/cGTP compliance and ensure ongoing compliance with other statutory requirements the FD&C Act, such as the requirements for making manufacturing changes to an approved NDA or BLA.
Even after a new drug or biologic approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw that approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. If a previously unknown problem, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, is discovered or the manufacturer fails to comply with regulatory requirements, the FDA may require revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; may impose additional post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or may impose distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences of regulatory non-compliance include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs/BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;
•consent degrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug and biological products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant penalties. In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to a variety of federal and state laws, the most recent of which is still in the process of being phased into the U.S. supply chain and regulatory framework.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Most recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10‑year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated

by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Other Health Care Regulations
If our product candidates are approved in the United States, we will have to comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws, rules and regulations. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Other federal and state laws and regulations that could directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate the business and/or financial performance include:
–state and local licensure, applicable to the processing and storage of human cells and tissues;
–laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, including the Office for Human Research Protections and the Office of Inspector General;
–state laws and regulations governing human subject research;
–federal and state coverage and reimbursement laws and regulations, including laws and regulations administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and state Medicaid agencies;
–the federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Law and similar state laws and regulations;
–the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and similar state laws and regulations;
–the federal physician self-referral prohibition commonly known as the Stark Law, and state equivalents of the Stark Law;
–the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act that require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners and physician ownership and investment interests;
–Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements;
–state and local laws and regulations dealing with the handling and disposal of medical waste; and
–the Intermediate Sanctions rules of the IRS providing for potential financial sanctions with respect to “Excess Benefit Transactions” with tax-exempt organizations.
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Japan's Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Authority Regulation of Regenerative Medicine 
Prior to 2014, there was no specific regulatory oversight of regenerative medicine products in Japan. However, in November 2013, the Japanese authorities revised the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law and renamed it the Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Other Therapeutic Products Act (the “PMD Act”). The new legislation became effective on November 25, 2014 and provides for a timely introduction of innovative regenerative medicine products. The new legislation formalizes a legal basis for development of regenerative medicine therapies. The new legislation defines regenerative medicine products as processed human cells that are intended to be used for either (1) the reconstructive repair, or formation of structures or functions of the human body; (2) the treatment or prevention of human diseases; or (3) gene therapy.
The legislation allows the PMDA/Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (“MHLW”) to award conditional approval to a regenerative medicine therapy if there is evidence of adequate safety and results which predict likely efficacy. The evidence for efficacy may be based on surrogate endpoints and may come from an exploratory study. This conditional approval is time-
Index

limited, and there must be an agreement with PMDA/MHLW as to follow-up collection of information which confirms efficacy and safety, similar to a post-marketing commitment in the United States.
Under the PMD Act, products under consideration may also be given a SAKIGAKE designation (similar to an FDA “Breakthrough” or “RMAT” designation in certain respects) with a priority six month review period. Additionally, there is a commitment that the PMDA will facilitate research and development by giving scientific and regulatory advice to sponsors from the early stage of development.
According to the new legislation, the sponsor prepares a marketing authorization application which is submitted for review to the PMDA. The PMDA reviews the application and prepares a review report and recommendation which is submitted to the MHLW. The MHLW reviews the recommendation and makes a decision regarding approval of the product. This procedure is followed for both a conditional approval and subsequently for a full approval after the post-marketing commitments have been fulfilled.
SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS
Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are summarized below. The below summary of risk factors should be read together with the more detailed discussion of risks set forth following this section under the heading “Risk Factors,” as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
•We have incurred substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations in the past and expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we anticipate that we will need substantial additional financing to continue our operations; if we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our product development programs, and our business will be harmed.
•If our status as a smaller reporting company changes, Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may require an independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Any delays or difficulty in satisfying these requirements could adversely affect our future results of operations and our stock price.
•Our future success may be dependent on the timely and successful partnering and/or commercialization of HONEDRA®, our experimental product candidate for CLI and Buerger's Disease that is in clinical development in Japan, CLBS16 (XOWNA®) for CMD in clinical development in the United States, and CLBS201 for DKD in the United States, and if we encounter delays or further difficulties in the development of these product candidates, our business prospects would be significantly harmed.
•Our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
•We have experienced and may continue to experience delays in completing our clinical trials and in enrolling patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.
•We may be unable to manage multiple late stage clinical trials for a variety of product candidates simultaneously.
•The development of cell therapy product candidates is subject to uncertainty because autologous cell therapy is inherently variable.
•Any disruption to our access to the reagents we are using in the clinical development of our cell therapy product candidates could adversely affect our ability to perform clinical trials and seek future regulatory submissions.
•The initiation of pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for cell therapy product candidates requires the validation and establishment of manufacturing controls that may delay product development timelines.
•If serious or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of any of our product candidates, we may need to abandon or limit our development of that product candidate.
•A Fast Track designation by the FDA and other similar regulatory designations may not lead to a faster development, regulatory review, or approval process.
•Our clinical trials may fail to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which failure would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.
Index

•We presently rely on contract manufacturing organizations to produce our product candidates at development and commercial scale quantities and have not yet qualified an alternate manufacturing supply, which could negatively impact our ability to meet any future demand for the products.
•We may enter into collaborations, strategic alliances, additional licensing arrangements, acquisitions, business combinations and/or other strategic transactions in the future, any of which could require us to issue securities that could significantly dilute the shares of our existing stockholders, and we may not realize the benefits of any such alliances, licensing arrangements, acquisitions, business combinations or strategic transactions, if completed. . 
•Our cell therapy business is based on novel technologies that are inherently expensive, risky and may not be understood by or accepted in the marketplace, which could adversely affect our future value.
•If competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer, or less expensive than our product candidates or offer other advantages, our commercial prospects will be limited.
•We may be subject to significant product liability claims and litigation, including potential exposure from the use of our product candidates in human subjects, and our insurance may be inadequate to cover claims that may arise.
•We may be unable to retain key officers or employees or hire new key officers or employees needed to implement our business strategy and develop our products and businesses.
•Our internal computer systems, or those used by our clinical investigators, clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of development programs for our product candidates. Additionally, the increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.
•Contract development and manufacturing organizations have a finite cell manufacturing capacity, which limitations could inhibit the long-term growth prospects of our business such that it will need to improve manufacturing efficiency at our contract manufacturers in order to establish cost of goods levels that will permit approved products to succeed commercially.
•The development and commercialization of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and abroad, and the failure to receive regulatory approvals for cell therapy product candidates would likely have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects.
•We may be subject to numerous and varying privacy and security laws, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage.
•We will continue to be subject to extensive regulation following any product approvals, and if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may suffer a significant setback in our business.
•Health care companies have been the subject of federal and state investigations, and we could become subject to investigations in the future.
•It is uncertain to what extent government, private health insurers and third-party payors will approve coverage or provide reimbursement for the therapies and products to which our research and development relate. Availability for such reimbursement may be further limited by an increasing uninsured population and reductions in Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States.
•Competitor companies or hospitals may be able to take advantage of EU rules permitting sales of unlicensed medicines for individual patients to sell competing products without marketing authorization.
•We may be unable to obtain or maintain patent protection for our products and product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Index

•Litigation and third-party claims relating to intellectual property are expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to protect against infringement by third parties or defend ourselves against claims of infringement.
•In certain countries, patent holders may be required to grant compulsory licenses, which would likely have a significant and detrimental effect on any future revenues in such country.
•Our stock price has been, and will likely continue to be, highly volatile.
•We may fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, such that our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and its ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.
•In addition to potential dilution associated with potential future fundraising and strategic transactions, we currently have a significant number of securities outstanding that are exercisable for our common stock, which exercise could result in significant additional dilution and downward pressure on the stock's price.
•Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.
•Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.
