Item 1. Business
Our Company
 
Medical Transcription Billing, Corp., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is a healthcare information technology company that provides a fully integrated suite of proprietary web-based solutions, together with related business services, to healthcare providers. Our integrated Software-as-a-Service (or SaaS) platform is designed to help our clients increase revenues, streamline workflows and make better business and clinical decisions, while reducing administrative burdens and operating costs. We employ a highly educated workforce of more than 1,600 people in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, where we believe labor costs are approximately one-half the cost of comparable India-based employees and one-tenth the cost of comparable U.S. employees, thus enabling us to deliver our solutions at competitive prices.
 
Our flagship offering, PracticePro™, empowers healthcare practices with the core software and business services they need to address industry challenges on one unified SaaS platform. We deliver powerful, integrated and easy-to-use solutions to health care practices, which enable them to efficiently operate their businesses, manage clinical workflows and receive timely payment for their services. PracticePro consists of:
 

● | Practice management software and related tools, which facilitate the day-to-day operation of a medical practice; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Electronic health records (“EHR”), which are easy to use, highly ranked, and allow our clients to reduce paperwork and qualify for government incentives; 
● | Revenue cycle management (“RCM”) services, which include end-to-end medical billing, analytics, and related services; and 
● | Mobile Health (“mHealth”) solutions, including smartphone applications that assist patients and healthcare providers in the provision of healthcare services. 

 
While many of our clients leverage our full PracticePro suite, we also have a number of clients who utilize other popular EHR software, and for which we provide RCM services, including medical billing, analytics, and related services.
 
Adoption of our solutions requires little or no upfront expenditure by a practice. Additionally, our financial performance is linked directly to the financial performance of our clients because the vast majority of our revenues is based on a percentage of our clients’ collections. The standard fee for our complete, integrated, end-to-end solution is among the lowest in the industry.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we served approximately 980 customers, of which 230 utilized our clearinghouse and Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) services and 40 are using talkEHR™, a new platform we launched in mid-2017 . We provided medical billing to approximately 750 medical practices representing approximately 3,500 providers, (which we define as physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other clinical staff that render bills for their services) practicing in 68 specialties and subspecialties, in 43 states. Approximately 96% of the practices we serve consist of one to ten providers, with the majority of the practices we serve being primary care providers. However, our solutions are scalable and are appropriate for larger healthcare practices across a wide range of specialty areas. In fact, our customer with the largest revenue and number of providers is a 950 clinician practice that provides physical, occupational and speech therapy services to patients in multiple states.
 
On July 23, 2014, the Company completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common stock. The Company sold approximately 4 million shares at a price to the public of $5.00 per share.
 
During November 2015, the Company completed a public offering of its 11% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”). The Company sold 231,616 shares at a price of $25.00 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $4.7 million. In July 2016, the Company sold an additional 63,040 shares of Preferred Stock and received net proceeds of approximately $1.3 million, and during 2017, the Company raised a total of $16.4 million in net proceeds from a series of additional offerings totaling 765,000 shares of Preferred Stock, all at $25.00 per share. In May 2017, the Company completed a registered direct offering of one million shares of its common stock at $2.30 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million.

During 2016, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of four medical billing companies, Gulf Coast Billing, Inc., Renaissance Medical Billing, LLC, WFS Services, Inc. and MediGain, LLC, including its subsidiary Millennium Practice Management Associates, LLC and two offshore subsidiaries in India and Sri Lanka. WFS also had a mailing service operation.
 
We sometimes refer to these acquisitions collectively as the “2016 Acquisitions.”
 
During the year 2017, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Washington Medical Billing, LLC, another medical billing company.
 
Employees
 
Including the employees of our subsidiaries, as of January 2018, we employed approximately 1,700 people worldwide on a full-time basis. We also use the services of a small number of part time employees. In addition, all officers work on a full-time basis. Over the next twelve months, we anticipate increasing our total number of employees only if our revenues increase or our operating requirements warrant such hiring, or for specific functions where we place additional emphasis, such as marketing and sales.
Our Growth Strategy 
 
Our growth strategy involves two primary approaches: acquiring smaller RCM companies and then migrating the clients of those companies to our solutions, as well as growing organically through referrals from industry partners and our clients. The RCM service industry is highly fragmented, with many local and regional RCM companies serving small medical practices. We believe that the industry is ripe for consolidation and that we can achieve significant growth through acquisitions. We further believe that it is becoming increasingly difficult for traditional RCM companies to meet the growing technology and business service needs of healthcare providers without a significant investment in information technology infrastructure. Since the Company went public in July 2014, we have acquired substantially all of the assets of 10 RCM companies. Although the specific arrangements have varied with each transaction, typical arrangements include a deeply-discounted price, consideration which is tied to revenues from customer relationships acquired, and structuring the acquisition as an asset purchase so as to limit our liability. We typically use our technology and our cost-effective offshore team to reduce costs promptly after the transaction closes, although there will be initial costs associated with the integration of the new businesses with our existing operations.
 
We believe we will also be able to further accelerate organic growth by partnering with industry participants, obtaining referrals and utilizing them as channel partners to offer integrated solutions to their clients. We have entered into arrangements with industry participants from which we began to derive revenue starting in mid-2014, including emerging EHR providers and other healthcare vendors that lack a full suite of solutions. We have developed application interfaces with numerous EHR systems, together with device and lab integration.
 
During 2017, we also started to reap the benefits of our investment in several growth initiatives. For example, we successfully launched our next-generation, voice-enabled electronic health records solution, talkEHR™, with provider sign-ups in most states. It is our vision with talkEHR to design a user-friendly, intuitive platform that automates and increases patient charting efficiency by using artificial intelligence and natural language processing. talkEHR is offered free of cost to all U.S. healthcare providers, with an option to upgrade to a premium billing solution that generates revenue for MTBC.
 
We also signed one of the 10 largest insurance carriers in the U.S. as our first client for EnrollmentPlus™, a new solution we launched during 2017 that is designed to improve the industry’s standard insurance enrollment workflow. We believe the insurance industry is yearning for faster onboarding times, reduced data remediation costs, process visibility and powerful analytics ‒ and we believe that we’ve developed a solution that will help accomplish these important objectives.
 
During late November 2017, we also signed a 950 clinician practice that provides physical, occupational and speech therapy services to patients in multiple states. This customer is now active, and is already our largest customer as measured by monthly revenue.

Industry Overview 
 
In 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) estimated that U.S. healthcare spending increased by 4.3% to reach $3.3 trillion, or $10,348 per person. Healthcare spending growth decelerated in 2016 after the initial impacts of Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) coverage expansions and strong retail prescription drug spending growth in 2014 and 2015. The overall share of gross domestic product (“GDP”) devoted to healthcare spending was 17.9% in 2016.
 
National health spending is projected to grow at an average rate of 5.6% per year for 2016-25, and 4.7% per year on a per capita basis. Health spending is projected to grow 1.2 percentage points faster than GDP per year over the 2016-25 period; as a result, the health share of GDP is expected to rise to 19.9% by 2025.
 
Increasingly complex reimbursement processes. New laws and payer requirements have further complicated insurance reimbursement processes. For example, Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurances are increasingly requiring proof of adherence to best practices and improved patient health outcomes to support full reimbursement. Moreover, the recent shift to a new generation of insurance codes has dramatically increased the complexity associated with selecting appropriate procedure and diagnosis codes needed to support proper claim reimbursement.
 
Movement toward healthcare information technology. Since 2011, the federal government has offered financial incentives to eligible healthcare providers who adopt and meaningfully use electronic health records technology. Beginning in 2015, providers who are not meaningfully using this technology incurred penalties, which increase over time. While these incentives and penalties have encouraged many providers to adopt and meaningfully use electronic health records software, we believe that most providers are not utilizing an integrated platform that combines practice management, business intelligence, and revenue cycle management. The lack of an integrated platform leaves them ill-equipped to address the multitude of rapidly growing industry challenges.
 
The North American RCM market has been estimated by MicroMarket Monitor to be approximately $26 billion in 2017, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 12% per year. The North American EHR market has been estimated by Transparency Market Research to be approximately $11 billion in 2016, growing at a CAGR of 6% per year. Standalone billing and practice management solutions are reported to be on the wane in the market today as medical practices move towards integrated, end-to-end systems that integrate front and back office data flows, provide seamless access to clinical data from EHRs, and rationalize and streamline the entire revenue cycle management process.
 
Shift in Focus to Preventive Care. In an effort to avoid the negative health effects and increased costs associated with undetected and untreated chronic conditions, most health insurance plans provide co-payment and deductible-free coverage for preventive health services, such as annual well visits. Many believe that this shift in focus will, in the long-term, reduce costs and improve patient health.
 
Inaccessibility of critical data. To thrive in the emerging healthcare landscape, healthcare practices need timely information, such as health insurance plan eligibility and coverage details, provider performance and productivity data and clinical and reimbursement benchmarking. However, we believe that most small and medium size practices do not have access to this type of real-time data, business intelligence and analytical tools and thus struggle to efficiently operate their practices and make optimal decisions.
 
Competition
 
The market for practice management, EHR and RCM information solutions and related services is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We face competition from other providers of both integrated and stand-alone practice management, EHR and RCM solutions, including competitors who utilize a web-based platform and providers of locally installed software systems. Our competitors also include larger healthcare IT companies, such as athenahealth, Inc., eClinicalWorks, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. and Greenway Medical Technologies, Inc.
 
Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. We also compete with various regional RCM companies, some of which may continue to consolidate and expand into broader markets. We expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of incentives provided by various governmental initiatives, and consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. In addition, our competitive edge could be diminished or completely lost if our competition develops similar offshore operations in Pakistan or other countries, such as India and the Philippines, where labor costs are lower than those in the U.S. (although higher than in Pakistan). Pricing pressures could negatively impact our margins, growth rate and market share.

Our Solution
 
We believe that our fully integrated solutions uniquely address the challenges in the industry. Our solutions dramatically simplify the complexities inherent in the reimbursement process and thereby deliver objectively superior results, such as reduced claim denial rates, improved customer days in accounts receivable, reduced patient no-shows, increased well visit encounters and reimbursement. Our solutions empower our customers with the real-time data they need to be efficient and make better decisions, such as real-time insurance eligibility and deductible details, provider productivity details and payer benchmarking.
 
Our fully integrated suite of technology and business service solutions is designed to enable healthcare practices to thrive in the midst of a rapidly changing environment in which managing reimbursement, clinical workflows and day-to-day administrative tasks is becoming increasingly complex, costly and time-consuming. Moreover, the standard offering fee for our complete, integrated, end-to-end solution is typically 5% of a practice’s healthcare-related revenues, with a monthly minimum fee, plus a nominal one-time setup fee, and is among the lowest in the industry.
 
Our Business Strategy 
 
Our objective is to become the leading provider of integrated, end-to-end SaaS and business service solutions to healthcare providers practicing in an ambulatory setting. To achieve this objective, we employ the following strategies:

● | Provide comprehensive practice management, electronic health records, revenue cycle management and mobile health solutions to small and medium size healthcare practices. We believe that physician practices are in need of an integrated, end-to-end solution, such as the solution that MTBC provides, to manage the different facets of their businesses, from clinical documentation to claim submission and financial reporting. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Provide exceptional customer service. We realize that our success is tied directly to our customers’ success. Accordingly, a substantial portion of our highly trained and educated workforce is devoted to customer service activities. 
● | Leverage significant cost advantages provided by our technology and skilled offshore workforce. Our unique business model includes our web-based software and a cost-effective offshore workforce primarily based in Pakistan. We believe that this operating model provides us with significant cost advantages compared to other revenue cycle management companies and it allows us to significantly reduce the operational costs of the companies we acquire. 
● | Pursue strategic acquisitions. Approximately 49% of our current practices and 72% of our current year’s revenue were obtained through strategic transactions with revenue cycle management companies (collectively, the “Acquisitions”). With most of our acquisition transactions, our goal is to retain the acquired customers over the long-term and migrate those customers to our platform soon after closing. 

Our Service Offerings
 
We offer a suite of fully-integrated, web-based SaaS platform and business services designed for healthcare providers. Our products and services offer healthcare providers a unified solution designed to meet the healthcare industry’s demand for the delivery of cost-efficient, quality care with measureable outcomes. The four primary components of our proprietary web-based suite of services are: (i) practice management applications, (ii) a certified electronic health records solution, (iii) revenue cycle management services, and (iv) mobile health applications.
 
Our flagship product, PracticePro, provides our clients with a seamlessly integrated, end-to-end solution. Our web-based EHR are also available to customers as a standalone product. We regularly update our software platform with the goal of staying on the leading edge of industry developments, payer reimbursements trends and new regulations.

Web-based Practice Management Application 
 
Our proprietary, web-based practice management application automates the labor-intensive workflow of a medical office in a unified and streamlined SaaS platform. The various functions of the platform collectively support the entire workflow of the day-to-day operations of a medical office in an intuitive and user-friendly format. For example, our platform provides office staff with real-time insurance details to allow them to more efficiently collect patient payments; its automated appointment reminders reduce patient no-show rates, and scheduling functionality results in increased reimbursable patient well visit appointments. A simple, individual and secure login to our web-based platform gives physicians, other healthcare providers and staff members’ access to a vast array of real time practice management data which they can access at the office or from any other location where they can access the Internet. Users can customize the “Practice Dashboard” to display only the most useful and relevant information needed to carry out their particular functions. We believe that this streamlined and centralized automated workflow allows providers to focus on delivering quality patient care rather than office administration.
Electronic Health Records
 
Our web-based EHR solution has received ONC Health Information Technology certification. Moreover, in a previous study, KLAS, a leading independent industry assessor of healthcare information technology products, issued its annual electronic health records ranking and MTBC placed number five in our target market of one to ten providers, outperforming most leading electronic health records. A healthcare provider can use our solution to demonstrate “meaningful use” under federal law to earn incentives and avoid penalties. Our web-based electronic health records allow a provider to view all patient information in one online location, thus avoiding the need for numerous charts and records for each patient. Utilizing our web-based electronic health records solution, providers can track patients from their initial appointments; chart clinical data, history, and other personal information; enter and submit claims for medical services; and review and respond to queries for additional information regarding the billing process. Additionally, the electronic health record software delivers a robust document management system to enable providers to transition to paperless environments. The document management function makes available electronic connectivity between practitioners and patients, thereby streamlining patient care coordination and communications. In 2015, we introduced a tablet-based EHR, leveraging our web-based platform in a form that many providers find more convenient. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company introduced talkEHR, a voice enabled EHR solution.
Revenue Cycle Management and other Technology-driven Business Services
 
Our proprietary revenue cycle management offering is designed to improve the medical billing reimbursement process, allowing healthcare providers to accelerate and increase collections, reduce errors in submission and streamline workflow to free up practitioners to focus on patient care. Customers using PracticePro will generally see higher claims acceptance and resolution, and faster collections, as illustrated by the following for 2017:

● | Our first pass acceptance rate is approximately 96% 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our first pass resolution rate is approximately 94% 
● | Our clients’ median days in accounts receivable is 37 days for primary care and 41 days for combined specialties. 

 
These rates are among the most competitive in the industry and compare favorably with the performance of our largest competitor. Our revenue cycle management service employs a proprietary rules-based system designed and constantly updated by our knowledgeable workforce, who screens and scrubs claims prior to submission for payment.
 
Mobile Health Solutions 
 
The functionality of our cloud-based platform is extended to mobile devices through our integrated suite of mobile health applications. These mobile health applications include physician end-user tools that support, among other things, electronic prescribing, the capture of billing charges in the current medical coding formats, and the creation and secure transfer of clinical audio notes that are converted into text and billing charges. In 2015, we introduced an ICD-10 mHealth app for iOS and Android, which has emerged as the most popular ICD-10 app among U.S. healthcare providers. We also offer iCheckIn, a patient check-in app for iOS and Android-based tablet devices. Our patient applications allow patients to access their medical information, securely communicate with their doctors’ office, schedule appointments, request prescription refills, pay balances and check-in for office appointments.
