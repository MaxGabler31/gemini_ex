We make available free of charge (other than an investor’s own Internet access charges) on or through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after the material is electronically filed with or otherwise furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports are also available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 
Our year end for each of fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was October 1, 2022, October 2, 2021, and October 3, 2020, respectively. 
Key Events in Fiscal 2022
Signing of definitive agreement for the acquisition of Advanced Jet Automation Co., Ltd.
On September 8, 2022, the Company announced that one of its subsidiaries signed a definitive agreement for the acquisition of Advanced Jet Automation Co., Ltd. (“AJA”), a technology company headquartered in Taiwan. Upon the consummation of the transaction, we will acquire the designated dispensing assets and the dispensing business of AJAs affiliate, Samurai Spirit Inc., a leading developer and manufacturer of high-precision micro dispensing equipment and solutions in Taiwan. The acquisition is expected to close in fiscal 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. 
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have significantly impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, created volatility in equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, and affected unemployment levels. The global COVID-19 response remains dynamic and some countries continue to impose quarantines, containment measures or travel restrictions. In certain jurisdictions there has been a resurgence of illnesses or the threat of emerging new variants of the virus, which has led to more severe restrictions.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we previously had to temporarily close certain offices in the United States, Europe and Asia as well as execute our Business Continuity Plan (“BCP”), which measures have disrupted our business operations. Our manufacturing locations have returned to normal operations and, as most countries have relaxed the containment measures over the past few months, we have recalibrated our BCP and restarted other activities in conformance with local guidelines. Our BCP has not included significant headcount reductions or changes in our overall liquidity position.
Macroeconomic Headwinds
We continue to be impacted by the global shortage in electronic components and our supply chain is strained in some cases as the availability of materials, logistics and freight options are challenging in many jurisdictions, especially to, from and within China. In addition, the costs of logistics have increased as a result of macroeconomic conditions and general inflationary pressures, and labor shortages have further contributed to rising costs across the supply chain, further exacerbating the impact the pandemic has had on the supply chain. 
We believe that the semiconductor industry macroeconomics have not changed and we anticipate that the industry’s long-term growth projections will normalize, but the sector is seeing short-term volatility and disruptions due to general inflationary pressures, falling consumer sentiment, or economic downturn caused, directly or indirectly, by various macroeconomic factors, including the prolonged Ukraine/Russia conflict. 
The prolonged Ukraine/Russia conflict did not materially impact our financial condition and operating results in fiscal 2022. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, existing Facility Agreements, and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements, notwithstanding the prolonged Ukraine/Russia conflict or other macroeconomic factors, for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, this is a highly dynamic situation. As the macroeconomic situation remains highly volatile and the geopolitical situation remains uncertain, there is uncertainty surrounding the operations of our manufacturing locations, our business, our expectations regarding future demand or supply conditions and our near- and long-term liquidity, our financial condition and, consequentially, our operating results could deteriorate. 
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and general macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For other information, please see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
Share Repurchase Program
On August 15, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program (the “Program”) to repurchase up to $100 million of the Company’s common stock on or before August 1, 2020. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization under the Program to $200 million, $300 million and $400 million, respectively. On March 3, 2022, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization under the Program by an additional $400 million to $800 million, and extended its duration through August 1, 2025. The Company has entered into a written trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act to facilitate repurchases under the Program. The Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and is funded using the Company’s available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased through open market and/or privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under the Program depend on market conditions as well as corporate and regulatory considerations. 
During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2022, the Company repurchased a total of approximately 2,782.1 thousand shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $132.8 million. The stock repurchases were recorded in the periods they were delivered and accounted for as treasury stock in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company records treasury stock purchases under the cost method using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Upon re-issuance of treasury stock, amounts in excess of the acquisition cost are credited to additional paid-in capital. If the Company reissues treasury stock at an amount below its acquisition cost and additional paid-in capital associated with prior treasury stock transactions is insufficient to cover the difference between acquisition cost and the reissue price, this difference is recorded against retained earnings.
Accelerated Share Repurchase (“ASR”)
In addition to the 2,782.1 thousand shares of common stock repurchased under the Program during the fiscal year ended October 1, 2022, on March 9, 2022, the Company entered into an ASR agreement (the “March 2022 ASR Agreement”) with an investment bank counterparty (“Dealer”) to repurchase $150 million of the Company's common stock. The March 2022 ASR Agreement was entered into pursuant to the Company's current $800 million share repurchase authorization.
Under the March 2022 ASR Agreement, the Company made an up-front payment of $150 million to the Dealer and received an initial delivery of 2,449.9 thousand shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $120 million on March 10, 2022. The final number of shares to be repurchased will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the term of the transaction, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the March 2022 ASR Agreement. For accounting purposes, the March 2022 ASR Agreement is evaluated as an unsettled forward contract indexed to the Company’s own stock, with $30 million being classified within common stock. At settlement, the Dealer may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to the Company, or, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to deliver shares of its common stock or may elect to make a cash payment to the Dealer. 
The March 2022 ASR Agreement was settled between the Company and the Dealer on April 22, 2022 and the Company received an additional 344.5 thousand shares of common stock from the Dealer. In total, an aggregate of 2,794.4 thousand shares of common stock were delivered by the Dealer under the March 2022 ASR Agreement at an average price of $53.68 per share, which was then reclassified as treasury stock from common stock in shareholder’s equity. As of October 1, 2022, our remaining stock repurchase authorization under the Program was approximately $249.2 million.
Dividends
On August 30, 2022, June 8, 2022, March 3, 2022 and October 18, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of common stock. During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2022, the Company declared dividends of $0.68 per share of common stock. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that such dividends are in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders.
Business Environment
The semiconductor business environment is highly volatile and is driven by internal dynamics, both cyclical and seasonal, in addition to macroeconomic forces. Over the long term, semiconductor consumption has historically grown, and is forecast to continue to grow. This growth is driven, in part, by regular advances in device performance and by price declines that result from improvements in manufacturing technology. In order to exploit these trends, semiconductor manufacturers, both IDMs and OSATs, periodically invest aggressively in latest generation capital equipment. This buying pattern often leads to periods of excess supply and reduced capital spending—the so-called semiconductor cycle. Within this broad semiconductor cycle there are also, generally weaker, seasonal effects that are specifically tied to annual, end-consumer purchasing patterns. Typically, semiconductor manufacturers prepare for heightened demand by adding or replacing equipment capacity by the end of the September quarter. Occasionally, this results in subsequent reductions in the December quarter. This annual seasonality can be overshadowed by effects of the broader semiconductor cycle. Macroeconomic factors also affect the industry, primarily through their effect on business and consumer demand for electronic devices, as well as other products that have significant electronic content such as automobiles, white goods, and telecommunication equipment. There can be no assurances regarding levels of demand for our products and we believe historic industry-wide volatility will persist. 
In the Asia/Pacific region, our customer base has also become more geographically concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions. Approximately 94.4% and 96.4% of our net revenue for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, was for shipments to customer locations outside of the U.S., primarily in the Asia/Pacific region. Approximately 56.9% and 55.6% of our net revenue for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, was for shipments to customers located in China, which is subject to risks and uncertainties related to the respective policies of the governments of China and the U.S. Furthermore, there is a potential risk of conflict and instability in the relationship between Taiwan and China which could disrupt the operations of our customers and/or suppliers in both Taiwan and China, our manufacturing operations in China, and our future plans in the region. 
The U.S. and several other countries have levied tariffs on certain goods, and have introduced other trade restrictions, which, together with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic discussed above, has resulted in substantial uncertainties in the semiconductor, LED, memory and automotive markets.
Our Capital Equipment segment is primarily affected by the industry’s internal cyclical and seasonal dynamics in addition to broader macroeconomic factors that can positively or negatively affect our financial performance. The sales mix of IDM and OSAT customers in any period also impacts financial performance, as changes in this mix can affect our products’ average selling prices and gross margins due to differences in volume purchases and machine configurations required by each customer type.
Our Aftermarket Products and Services (“APS”) segment has historically been less volatile than our Capital Equipment segment. The APS sales are more directly tied to semiconductor unit consumption rather than capacity requirements and production capability improvements. 
We continue to position our business to leverage our research and development leadership and innovation and to focus our efforts on mitigating volatility, improving profitability and ensuring longer-term growth. We remain focused on operational excellence, expanding our product offerings and managing our business efficiently throughout the business cycles. Our visibility into future demand is generally limited, forecasting is difficult, and we generally experience typical industry seasonality.
To limit potential adverse cyclical, seasonal and macroeconomic effects on our financial position, we have continued our efforts to maintain a strong balance sheet. As of October 1, 2022, our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $775.5 million, a $35.7 million increase from the prior fiscal year end. We believe our strong cash position will allow us to continue to invest in product development and pursue non-organic growth opportunities. For example, as described in “Item 1. - Business - Key events in Fiscal 2022”, the Company announced that one of its subsidiaries signed a definitive agreement for the acquisition of AJA.
Technology Leadership
We compete largely by offering our customers advanced equipment and tools available for interconnect processes. We believe our technology leadership contributes to the strong market positions of our ball bonder, wedge bonder, mini LED placement, and tools products. To maintain our competitive advantage, we invest in product development activities designed to produce improvements to existing products and to deliver next-generation products. These investments often focus as much on improvements in the semiconductor assembly process as on specific pieces of assembly equipment or tools. In order to generate these improvements, we typically work in close collaboration with customers, end users, and other industry members. In addition to producing technical advances, these collaborative development efforts strengthen customer relationships and enhance our reputation as a technology leader and solutions provider. 
In addition to gold, silver alloy wire and aluminum wire, our leadership in the industry’s use of copper wire for the bonding process is an example of the benefits of our collaborative efforts. By working with customers, material suppliers, and other equipment suppliers, we have developed a series of robust, high-yielding production processes, which have made copper wire widely accepted and significantly reduced the cost of assembling an integrated circuit. 
Our leadership also has allowed us to maintain a competitive position in the latest generations of ball bonders. RAPID™ is the first product in the smart bonder series to address the Industry 4.0 requirements. The key features of this series include real-time process and performance monitoring, real-time equipment health monitoring, advanced data analytics and traceability, predictive maintenance monitoring and analysis, and detection and enhanced post-bond inspection. 
We optimize our bonder platforms to deliver variants of our products to serve emerging high-growth markets. For example, we have developed extensions to address opportunities in memory assembly with our RAPID™ MEM, in particular for NAND Flash storage.
Our leading technology for wedge bonder equipment uses ribbon or heavy wire for different applications such as power electronics, automotive and semiconductor applications. The advanced interconnect capabilities of PowerFusionPS®  improve the processing of high-density power packages, due to an expanded bondable area, wider leadframe capability, indexing accuracy and teach mode. In all cases, we are making a concerted effort to develop commonality of subsystems and design practices, in order to improve performance and design efficiencies. We believe this will benefit us as it will increase synergies between the various engineering product groups. Furthermore, we continually research adjacent market segments where our technologies could be used. Many of these initiatives are in the early stages of development and some have yielded results such as the Asterion™ hybrid wedge bonder, which is built on an enhanced architecture that includes an expanded bond area, laser bonding, new robust pattern recognition capabilities and extremely tight process controls. Another example of our developing equipment for high-growth niche markets is our AT Premier PLUS. This machine utilizes a modified wire bonding process to mechanically place bumps on devices in a wafer format, for variants of the flip chip assembly process. Typical applications include complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) image sensors, surface acoustical wave (“SAW”) filters and high brightness LEDs. These applications are commonly used in most, if not all, smartphones available today in the market. We also have expanded the use of AT Premier PLUS for wafer level wire bonding for micro-electro-mechanical systems (“MEMS”) and other sensors.
Our technology leadership and bonding process know-how have enabled us to develop highly function-specific equipment with high throughput and accuracy. This forms the foundation for our advanced packaging equipment development. We are also developing and manufacturing advanced packaging bonders for the emerging 2.5-dimensional integrated circuit (“2.5D IC”) and 3-dimensional integrated circuit (“3D IC”) markets. By reducing the interconnect dimensions, 2.5D ICs and 3D ICs are expected to provide form factor, performance and power efficiency enhancements over traditional flip-chip packages in production today. High-performance processing and memory applications, in addition to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, are anticipated to be earlier adopters of this new packaging technology. Chiplets are emerging as an alternative methodology for developing advanced system-level designs. Chiplets of various functions and typically fabricated in different process nodes are mixed-and-matched and assembled in a package with the goal of speeding up time-to-market and reducing cost. This methodology of developing advanced system-level designs is increasing the complexity of packages. Our leadership in system-in-package (“SiP”), multi-chip module (“MCM”) and heterogeneous integration are well positioned to address the requirements in this emerging and growing trend. In advancing our leadership in ultra-fine-pitch advanced packaging solution, we are offering fluxless bonding capability in selected advanced packaging equipment. 
We have also broadened our advanced packaging solutions for mass reflow to include high accuracy flip chip and fan-out wafer level packaging (“FOWLP”) with the KatalystTM. Our electronics assembly solutions are also capable of advanced package-on-package, wafer level packaging (“WLP”), embedded die, and active and passive die placement for SiP, enabling us to diversify our business while further expanding market reach into the automotive, LED lighting, medical and industrial segments.
During fiscal 2019, we entered into a new market, miniLED for display backlighting and direct emitting display, with the launch of PIXALUXTM. The PIXALUXTM is a high-speed die placement equipment, and one of the most mass production ready solutions for miniLED placement in the market. MiniLEDs are used in TV, IT display, large display, signage display, consumer display and automotive markets. The usage of miniLEDs is expected to grow significantly over the next few years, followed by microLED adoption. We intend to leverage the momentum we already have with PIXALUXTM to continue to innovate and provide solutions to the industry to meet the challenges of packaging and assembling the next-generation of electronic devices. In order to help strengthen this position, we have developed LUMINEXTM which is a laser-based mini and micro LED die transfer system. It is a highly flexible system capable of a single die transfer, multi-die transfer and mass transfer for the various applications in the advanced display value chain. LUMINEXTM combines laser technology, state-of-the-art optical systems, material engineering and high precision motion control to deliver industry leading throughput and placement accuracy. 
We bring the same technology focus to our tools business, driving tool design and manufacturing technology to optimize the performance and process capability of the equipment in which our tools are used. For all our equipment products, tools are an integral part of their process capability. We believe our unique ability to simultaneously develop both equipment and tools is a core strength supporting our products' technological differentiation.
Customers
Our major customers include IDMs, OSATs, industrial manufacturers and automotive electronics suppliers. Revenue from our customers may vary significantly from year-to-year based on their respective capital investments, operating expense budgets, and overall industry trends. For other information regarding our concentrations and customers, see “Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 17: Commitments, Contingencies and Concentrations”. There was no customer with sales representing more than 10% of our net revenue in fiscal 2022. 
Sales and Customer Support
We believe long-term customer relationships are critical to our success, and comprehensive sales support and customer support are an important means of establishing those relationships. To maintain these relationships, we primarily utilize our direct sales force, as well as distribution channels such as agents and distributors, depending on the product, region, or end-user application. In all cases, our goal is to position our sales support and customer support resources near our customers’ facilities so as to provide support for customers in their own language and consistent with local customs. Our sales support and customer support resources are located primarily in Singapore, Israel, Taiwan, China, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, the U.S., Germany, Mexico, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Supporting these local resources, we have technology centers offering additional process expertise in Singapore, China, Switzerland, Israel, the U.S. and the Netherlands. 
By establishing relationships with semiconductor manufacturers, OSATs, and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems, we gain insight into our customers' future semiconductor packaging strategies. In addition, we also send our products and equipment to customers or potential customers for trial and evaluation. These insights assist us in our efforts to develop products and processes that address our customers' future assembly requirements. 
Backlog
Our backlog consists of customer orders scheduled for shipment within the next twelve months. A majority of our orders are subject to cancellation or deferral by our customers with limited or no penalties. Also, customer demand for our products can vary dramatically without prior notice. Because of the volatility of customer demand, possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations and potential delays in product shipments, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of net revenue for any succeeding period.
The following table reflects our backlog as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021:

 | As of 
(in thousands) | October 1, 2022 | | October 2, 2021
Backlog | $ | 510,145 | | $ | 787,241

Manufacturing
We believe excellence in manufacturing can create a competitive advantage, both by producing at lower costs and by providing superior responsiveness to changes in customer demand. To achieve these goals, we manage our manufacturing operations through a single organization and believe that fewer, larger factories allow us to capture economies of scale and generate cost savings through lower manufacturing costs. 
Our equipment manufacturing activities consist mainly of integrating outsourced parts and subassemblies and testing finished products to customer specifications. We largely utilize an outsource model, allowing us to minimize our fixed costs and capital expenditures. For certain low-volume, high customization parts, we manufacture subassemblies ourselves. Just-in-time inventory management has reduced our manufacturing cycle times and lowered our on-hand inventory requirements. Raw materials used in our equipment manufacturing are generally available from multiple sources; however, many outsourced parts and components are only available from a single or limited number of sources.
Our ball bonder, wedge bonder, AT Premier, APAMA and KatalystTM bonder manufacturing and assembly is done at our facility in Singapore. Our Hybrid and Electronic Assembly solutions manufacturing and assembly is done at our facility in the Netherlands. We have ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications for our equipment manufacturing facilities in Singapore and in the Netherlands.
We manufacture dicing blades, capillaries and a portion of our bonding wedge inventory at our facility in China. The capillaries are made using blanks produced at our facilities in China and Israel. We both produce and outsource the production of our bonding wedges. Our China and Israel facilities are ISO 9001 certified. Our China facility is also ISO 14001 and ISO 18001 certified.
Research and Product Development 
Many of our customers generate technology roadmaps describing their projected packaging technology requirements. Our research and product development activities are focused on delivering robust production solutions to those projected requirements. We accomplish this by regularly introducing improved versions of existing products or by developing next-generation products. We follow this product development methodology in all our major product lines. 
Intellectual Property 
Where circumstances warrant, we apply for patents on inventions governing new products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, and manufacturing activities. We currently hold a number of U.S. patents, many of which have foreign counterparts. We believe the duration of our patents often exceeds the commercial life cycles of the technologies disclosed and claimed in the patents. Additionally, we believe much of our important technology resides in our trade secrets and proprietary software. 
Competition 
The market for semiconductor equipment and packaging materials products is intensely competitive. Significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment market include price, speed/throughput, production yield, process control, delivery time, innovation, quality and customer support, each of which contribute to lower the overall cost per package being manufactured. Our major equipment competitors are ASM Pacific Technology, BE Semiconductor Industries N.V., Hanwha Precision Machinery Co., Ltd. and Shinkawa Ltd. 
Significant competitive factors in the semiconductor packaging materials industry include performance, price, delivery, product life, and quality. Our significant tools competitors are Precision Engineering Company, Disco Corporation, Small Precision Tools Co. Ltd. and Chaozhou Three-Circle (Group) Co., Ltd. 
In each of the markets we serve, we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants, some of which may have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing resources. 
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use, emission, discharge, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of our employees. In addition, we are subject to environmental laws which may require investigation and cleanup of any contamination at facilities we own or operate or at third-party waste disposal sites we use or have used. 
We have incurred in the past, and expect in the future to incur, costs to comply with environmental laws. We are not, however, currently aware of any material costs or liabilities relating to environmental matters, including any claims or actions under environmental laws or obligations to perform any cleanups at any of our facilities or any third-party waste disposal sites, that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. However, it is possible that material environmental costs or liabilities may arise in the future. 
Though the majority of our manufacturing activities take place outside of the U.S., certain of our advanced packaging products are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) because they are based on U.S. technology or contain more than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content. The EAR require licenses for, and sometimes prohibit, the export of certain products. The Commerce Control List (“CCL”) sets forth the types of goods and services controlled by the EAR, including civilian science, technology, and engineering dual-use items. For products listed on the CCL, a license may be required as a condition to export depending on the end destination, end use or end user and any applicable license exceptions.
Our business is subject to various other regulations typical of businesses of our type in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Business Continuity Management Plan
We have developed and implemented a global Business Continuity Management Plan (“BCP”) for our business operations. The BCP is designed to facilitate the prompt resumption of our business operations and functions arising from an event which impacts or potentially impacts our business operations. As the scale, timing, and impact of disasters and disruptions are unpredictable, the BCP has been designed to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. The BCP provides a structured framework for safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting our books and records, perpetuating critical business functions, and enabling the continuation of customer transactions.
Human Capital
Our Employees
Our talented employees are critical to our ability to achieve the Company’s vision to be the leading technology and service provider of innovative interconnect solutions enabling a smart future. As of October 1, 2022, we had 2,944 full-time employees and 223 temporary workers worldwide.
Diversity & Inclusion
We are committed to providing a diverse and collaborative environment that is rich in opportunities and which enables our employees to grow both professionally and personally in their careers within the Company. We are also committed to treating employees with dignity and respect. Diversity is important to the Company and we believe that the combined knowledge and diverse views that our employees contribute across our global locations strengthens our competitive edge. We value different backgrounds, celebrate unique perspectives, and believe that diversity and inclusion are essential to creating an environment where we can achieve our best innovation essential to the success of the Company. In fiscal 2022, the Company incorporated its Diversity & Inclusion (“D&I”) program into its Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) structure. 
The D&I program's vision is to enhance and improve the experience of everyone who works at the Company; encourage and recognize their contributions and successes, in an inclusive, cohesive, and collegial environment; and celebrate the diverse voices of our employees. In furtherance of that vision, in fiscal 2022, the Company conducted an organization equity assessment, hosted global trainings and diversity events which educated employees more about D&I in the workplace, and adopted an 18-month strategic plan. 
Safe Workplace
We endeavor to provide a safe and healthy workplace for all our employees. The health and safety of our employees is of paramount importance to the Company, and forms an integral part of our organizational culture. We have Environment, Health and Safety (“EHS”) practices, objectives and performance targets at each of our key manufacturing and R&D sites, which are overseen by an EHS Committee, led by an EHS Manager or a Safety Representative from each key operations function. To ensure that all employees are familiar with our safety standards and actions, we conduct regular health and safety-related trainings including an online based Corporate Safety Training module as well as hands-on preparedness training comprising periodic fire drill evacuations, first-aid, fire-fighting and hazardous chemical spillage response drills. This training is included in our new hire on-boarding programs with employee-wide refresher trainings conducted every two years. 
Additionally, as part of our business continuity measures and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have assembled a management-led COVID-19 Committee comprising directors and managers of various key departments to provide global oversight and guidance in implementing site-specific business continuity and risk mitigation plans across our key sites. We regularly communicate with country management teams and tailor our policies according to the latest developments and guidelines provided by global authorities such as World Health Organization (“WHO”) and the local authorities at each site with the goal of ensuring the safety of all our team members while minimizing disruption to operations and providing support to our local communities. 
Human Resource (“HR”) Practices
At K&S, we aim to recruit, develop and retain a high performing and diverse workforce while fostering a safe and productive work environment for employees to maximize individual and organizational potential. Our regional HR managers support the local leaders and managers, ensuring that our employment and labor practices adhere to regional and local regulations. We continually review these policies and benchmark them against market peers to help ensure that we implement leading practices on recruitment, onboarding and employee development. Our HR function also includes centers of excellence in Talent Management, Talent Acquisition, HR Management Information System, and Global Compensation and Benefits, ensuring best practices in these important areas. 
Employee Development
We believe in investing in our employees’ professional growth by encouraging them to continually develop their functional and leadership skills and to gain different experiences across the Company as they progress along their career paths and grow within our organization. Our Learning and Development Framework which is based on identified professional and management competencies and the Company’s core values, is tailored to specific target groups such as new hires, professional and support staff levels, manager levels as well as identified key talents from our succession planning process. These development programs are also based on the 70/20/10 learning and development model under which individuals obtain 70% of their knowledge through experiential learning, 20% through social learning and 10% from formal educational events. We encourage our employees to not only participate actively in technical and soft skill training programs, but also to learn through peer coaching and mentoring, and to develop professionally through various stretch assignments and projects. 
Compensation & Benefits
We strive to ensure fair, equitable and competitive pay for all employees within the locations where they work, and we obtain market knowledge about pay levels by participating in multiple globally recognized compensation surveys annually. The survey organizations pool our data together with all the responding companies to determine market relevant pay ranges for all our positions. Our analysis and programs also evaluate industry sector information most relevant to us. The Company also strives to ensure that our employee benefits are compliant in the cities, states and countries in which we operate, while annual benefits benchmarking ensures that our benefits are attractive in the markets where we compete for talent. 
Employee Engagement
As part of our employee engagement initiatives, every two to three years, we conduct a global employee engagement survey, the “Voice of K&S”, to gather feedback from all our employees on various aspects of their work and on our corporate culture. Survey results are reviewed by management teams to identify improvement opportunity areas. Following employee feedback in the last survey, the Company has introduced a formalized career progression framework and associated tools to provide clarity and guidance to both managers and employees. The framework provides clarity and tools for employees in the Professional and Management Career tracks on the requisite competencies for advancement to the next career level within the Company. Employees are encouraged to enroll in the various training courses intended to support their development in the required competency stages as they chart their career progression with the Company.
Work flexibility, which had been critical to our success throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, has now become part of our culture. We have provided tools and infrastructure to enable employees the choice and flexibility of a range of flexible work arrangement options that best meet their needs while allowing them to continue to fulfill business objectives. 
Open Door Policy
We maintain an open-door policy through our grievance and whistleblowing procedures and provide multiple avenues for employees to voice their concerns and raise suggestions. Employees may report any grievances to their immediate supervisor, local HR representatives or the Global Vice President of HR. Employees may also raise any concerns of legal violation, violation of the Company’s codes and policies, improper or unethical business practices, or concealment of any wrong-doing through the whistleblower hotline or website. We take every raised complaint seriously and prohibit any form of retaliation against any employee for lodging a complaint in good faith.
