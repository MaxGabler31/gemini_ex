ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
Beyond Meat is a leading plant-based meat company offering a portfolio of revolutionary plant-based meats. We build meat directly from plants, an innovation that enables consumers to experience the taste, texture and other sensory attributes of popular animal-based meat products while enjoying the nutritional and environmental benefits of eating our plant-based meat products. Our brand commitment, “Eat What You Love,” represents a strong belief that there is a better way to feed our future and that the positive choices we all make, no matter how small, can have a great impact on our personal health and the health of our planet. By shifting from animal-based meat to plant-based protein, we can positively impact four growing global issues: human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources and animal welfare. The success of our breakthrough innovation model and products has allowed us to appeal to a broad range of consumers, including those who typically eat animal-based meats, positioning us to compete directly in the $1.4 trillion global meat industry.
To capture this broad market opportunity, we have developed three core plant-based product platforms that align with the largest meat categories globally: beef, pork and poultry. The primary components of animal-based meat—amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, trace minerals and water—are not exclusive to animals and are plentiful in plants. We create our plant-based products using proprietary scientific processes that determine the architecture of the animal-based meat we are seeking to replicate and then we assemble it using plant-derived amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, trace minerals and water. We are focused on continuously improving our products so that they are, to the human sensory system, indistinguishable from their animal-based counterparts.
Our flagship product is the Beyond Burger, designed to look, cook and taste like a traditional beef burger. We also sell a range of other plant-based meat products, including Beyond Sausage, Beyond Beef, Beyond Meatballs, Beyond Breakfast Sausage Patties, Beyond Breakfast Sausage Links, Beyond Beef Crumbles, Beyond Italian Sausage Crumbles and Beyond Chicken Tenders. All of our products are made from simple ingredients without GMOs, hormones, antibiotics or cholesterol. With the exception of certain Beyond Beef Crumbles which are not certified Kosher, all of our products are certified Kosher and Halal. All of our products are good to excellent sources of protein and we are focused on making them nutritionally dense, with minimal negative attributes relative to their animal protein equivalents. As of December 2021, our products were available at approximately 130,000 retail and foodservice outlets in more than 90 countries worldwide, across mainstream grocery, mass merchandiser, club store, convenience store and natural retailer channels, direct-to-consumer, and various food-away-from-home channels, including restaurants, foodservice outlets and schools.
Research, development and innovation are core elements of our business strategy, and we believe they represent a critical competitive advantage for us. Through our Beyond Meat Rapid and Relentless Innovation Program, our team of scientists and engineers focuses on making continuous improvements to our existing product formulations and developing new products across our plant-based beef, pork and poultry platforms. Our state-of-the-art Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center in El Segundo, California brings together leading scientists from chemistry, biology, material science, food science and biophysics disciplines who work together with process engineers and culinary specialists to pursue our vision of perfectly building plant-based meat.
Net revenues increased to $464.7 million in 2021 from $406.8 million in 2020 and $297.9 million in 2019, representing a 25% compound annual growth rate over a two-year period, compared to a 115% compound growth rate over a two-year period in 2020. We have generated losses since inception. Net loss in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $182.1 million, $52.8 million and $12.4 million, respectively, as we pursued our long-term goal of future growth of our business, investing in innovation, people, infrastructure, product scaling and establishing strategic partnerships in the U.S., EU and China. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect will continue to have certain negative impacts on our business. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and other authorities around the world implemented significant measures intended to control the spread of the virus, including social distancing 
measures, business closures or restrictions on operations, quarantines and travel bans. While some of these restrictions were lifted or eased in many jurisdictions as the rates of COVID-19 infections have decreased or stabilized and as various COVID-19 vaccines have become more widely available, a resurgence of COVID-19 and the impact of variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 in some markets has slowed the reopening process. It is challenging to estimate the extent of the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations due to continued uncertainty regarding the duration, magnitude and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Foodservice channel net revenues recovered from 2020 levels and increased 31.7% to $139.9 million in 2021 from $106.2 million in 2020. Despite the improvement in foodservice channel net revenues in 2021 compared to the prior year, we recognize that our anticipation of continued steady recovery in the foodservice channel is based on the assumption that COVID-19 infection rates both in the U.S. and abroad will be reasonably contained. However, during the second half of 2021, the recent and more virulent COVID-19 variants adversely impacted the foodservice recovery. The impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic also continue to result in delays in tests or launches of our products among our foodservice customers and negatively impact the rate of our growth. 
Retail channel net revenues increased 8.1% to $324.8 million in 2021 from $300.6 million in 2020. The increase in retail channel net revenues in 2021 was primarily driven by increased sales to international customers, partially offset by decreased sales in the U.S. retail channel. U.S. retail channel net revenues decreased to $243.4 million in 2021 from $264.1 million in 2020 primarily due to a general slowdown of growth in the U.S. plant-based meat category, higher trade discounts and, to a lesser extent, increased competition. 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our retail and foodservice channels accounted for approximately 69.9% and 30.1% of our net revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our retail and foodservice channels accounted for approximately 73.9% and 26.1% of our net revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our U.S. and international channels accounted for approximately 68.8% and 31.2% of our net revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our U.S. and international channels accounted for approximately 79.9% and 20.1% of our net revenues, respectively. The change in mix of our distribution channels has been significant since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is likely to continue to cause fluctuation in our financial results pending its duration, magnitude and effects.
Our Mission
We are a mission-driven business with long-standing core values. We strive to operate in an honest, socially responsible and environmentally sustainable manner and are committed to help solve the major health and global environmental issues which we believe are caused in part by an animal-based protein diet and existing industrial livestock production. We believe our authentic and long-standing commitment to these causes better positions us to build loyalty and trust with current consumers and helps attract new ones. Our corporate culture embodies these values and, as a result, we enjoy a highly motivated and skilled work force committed to our mission and our enterprise.
The Beyond Meat Strategic Difference
•Unique Approach to the Product
We employ a revolutionary and unique approach to create our products, with a goal of delivering the same satisfying taste, aroma and texture as the animal-based meats we seek to replicate. In our Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center, our scientists and engineers work to continuously improve our products to replicate the sensory experience of animal-based meat. Each product is designed to not only closely replicate the taste and sensory experience of its animal protein equivalent, but to also provide the nutritional and environmental benefits of plant-based meat.
We start by analyzing the composition and design of relevant animal-based meats at the molecular and structural level. The primary components, other than water, comprising animal-based meats are amino acids, 
lipids, carbohydrates and trace minerals, which are not exclusive to animals and are present in abundance in plants. The amino acids that form the proteins which represent the muscle of animal-based meat can be sourced from plants. We use proteins primarily extracted from yellow peas, as well as mung beans, faba beans, brown rice and other plant stock, through a physical process to separate protein and fiber. We then apply heating, cooling and pressure at rapid and varied intervals to weave the protein into a fibrous structure to create woven protein. Our woven protein is converted according to our formulas and specifications into a packaged product at our own facilities or by our network of co-manufacturers, after which the final packaged product is then shipped to distributors or direct to customers.
•Unique Approach to the Market
Our breakthrough product innovations have enabled a paradigm shift in both marketing and target audience—tapping into the enthusiastic pull from mainstream consumers for delicious and satisfying, yet better-for-you plant-based meats. This approach is summed up in our brand promise—“Eat What You Love.” When we launched our flagship Beyond Burger in 2016, we approached the marketplace in an unprecedented way. Instead of marketing and merchandising the Beyond Burger to vegans and vegetarians, we requested that the product be sold in the meat case at grocery retailers where meat-loving consumers are accustomed to shopping for center-of-plate proteins. We believe merchandising in the meat case in the retail channel has helped drive greater brand awareness with our end consumers.
Reflecting the strength and value of the Beyond Meat brand to its partners, many of our foodservice customers choose to prominently feature our brand name on their menu and within item descriptions, in addition to displaying Beyond Meat branded signage throughout the venue. We believe that we have established our brand as one with “halo” benefits to our partners as evidenced by the speed of adoption by strategic partners. Our foodservice channel not only functions as a form of paid trial for our products, helping to drive additional retail demand, but also creates even greater brand awareness for Beyond Meat through the on-menu and in-store publicity we receive. 
•Unique Approach to Our Brand
Our mission is to create nutritious plant-based meats that taste delicious and deliver a consumer experience that is indistinguishable from that provided by animal-based meats. We believe our brand commitment, “Eat What You Love,” encourages consumers to eat more, not less, of the traditional dishes they enjoy by using our products, while feeling great about the health, sustainability and animal welfare benefits associated with consuming plant-based protein. Our approach of bringing to market the best innovations each year is a strategy that engages the consumer and provides feedback from which we iterate and improve. This approach is one of the reasons all of our current U.S. retail products are non-GMO.
Our brand awareness has been driven by strong digital and social media marketing to reach our digitally native target audience. Consumers and the media are enthusiastic about the concept of authentically meaty tasting plant-based proteins. The viral nature of our marketing and brand-building has been enhanced by both the network of brand ambassadors we have developed throughout the United States and abroad, and our strong following by celebrities from the worlds of sports and entertainment who help promote the benefits of a plant-based diet and the Beyond Meat brand.
We launched the Go Beyond marketing campaign in February 2019, which seeks to mobilize our ambassadors to help raise brand awareness and make our products aspirational. In 2020, as part of this campaign, we launched our What if We all Go Beyond? brand anthem, inviting consumers to see how over time through small changes, such as what we put at the center of our plates, there can be a meaningful collective impact on human health and the health of our planet. Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in the second quarter of 2020 we undertook our Feed A Million+ campaign, where we, with the support of our brand ambassadors and other partners, donated and distributed more than one million Beyond Burgers and nourishing meals at no cost to food banks, healthcare workers, frontline responders and communities in need across the country. In 2021, we built awareness, reached new users and drove conversion via our Beyond Delicious campaign and our flagship Beyond Burger. Our messaging was focused on our core pillars of taste, 
health and sustainability in celebration of key tentpole moments such as summer grilling and tailgate season. We are focused on continuing to scale the Go Beyond campaign to new levels globally, using celebrity activation and paid media campaigns to welcome consumers to the brand, define the category and remain its leader. 
Our Industry and Market Opportunity 
We operate in the large and global meat industry, which is comprised of fresh and packaged animal-based meats for human consumption. According to data from Fitch Solutions Macro Research, the meat industry is the largest category in food and in 2017 generated estimated sales across retail and foodservice channels of approximately $270 billion in the United States and approximately $1.4 trillion globally. We believe our revenue growth will allow us to capture an increased share of the broader U.S. meat category, supported by a number of key drivers, including the authentic comparability and sensory experience of our products to their animal-based meat equivalents, continued mainstream acceptance of our products with the traditional animal-based meat consumer, heightened consumer awareness of the role that food and nutrition, particularly plant-based foods, play in long-term health and wellness, and growing concerns related to the negative environmental and animal-welfare impacts of animal-based meat consumption. As a market leader in the plant-based meat category, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of and drive this category growth. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following strengths position us to generate growth and pursue our objective to become a leader in the global meat category.
•Dedicated Focus on Innovation 
We invest significant resources in our innovation capabilities to develop plant-based meat alternatives to popular animal-based meat products. Our innovation team, comprised of over 200 scientists, engineers, researchers, technicians and chefs, as of December 31, 2021, has delivered several unique plant-based meat breakthroughs, as well as continuous improvements to existing products. We are able to leverage what we learn about taste, texture, aroma and appearance across our plant-based beef, pork and poultry platforms and apply this knowledge to each of our product offerings. In our Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center, we have a strong pipeline of products in development, and can more rapidly transition our research from bench top to scaled production. As our knowledge and expertise deepens, our pace of innovation is accelerating, allowing for reduced time between new product launches. We expect this faster pace of product introductions and meaningful enhancements to existing products to continue as we innovate within our core plant-based platforms of beef, pork and poultry. 
•Brand Mission Aligned with Consumer Trends
We believe our brand is uniquely positioned to capitalize on growing consumer interest in great-tasting, nutritious, convenient, higher protein content and plant-based foods. We have also tapped into growing public awareness of major issues connected to animal protein, including human health, climate change, resource conservation and animal welfare. Simply put, our products aim to enable consumers to “Eat What You Love” without the downsides of conventional animal protein. 
We have built a powerful brand with broad demographic appeal and a passionate consumer base. Our brand awareness is driven by strong digital and social media marketing. Our audience continues to grow from the attention generated by our large following of celebrities, influencers and brand ambassadors who identify with our mission.
•Product Portfolio Generates Demand Across Channels
Growing sales of our products have helped us foster strong relationships in a relatively short period of time. We provide our retailers with exciting new products in the meat case, where innovation rarely occurs. Many of our retail customers have experienced increasing levels of velocity of our products, measured by units sold per month per store, as well as repeat purchases.
Our foodservice customers are excited by the opportunity to differentiate their menu offerings and attract new customers by partnering with Beyond Meat, and are seeking new ways to further promote our products, for example through mass media advertising campaigns inclusive of TV, radio, out of home and digital channels. We believe our customers’ choice to feature Beyond Meat demonstrates the marketing power of our brand and overall consumer excitement for our products. This type of demand for our products has been a driving force in building strong ties with customers who have been continually impressed by the impact our brand can make on their business.
•Experienced and Passionate Executive Management Team
We are led by a proven and experienced executive management team. Prior to founding Beyond Meat, Ethan Brown, our President and Chief Executive Officer, spent over a decade in the clean energy industry working for hydrogen fuel cell leader, Ballard Power Systems, rising from an entry level manager to reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Brown’s significant experience in clean tech, coupled with a natural appreciation for animal agriculture, led him to start a plant-based food company. Our executive management team plays an integral role in Beyond Meat’s success by instilling a culture committed to innovation, customer satisfaction and growth. Over time, we have grown our executive management team with carefully selected individuals who possess substantial industry experience and share our core values. The other members of our executive management team have broad industry experience, including at both consumer packaged goods companies and high growth businesses. 
Cost Down Strategy
A key component of our strategy is to drive the cost of our product down over time, with the aspiration to eventually price at parity with animal-based protein. To enable this, in 2021 we kicked off our Cost Down program. The program consists of multiple workstreams with each workstream having an owner and a distinct cost reduction goal. We are pursuing initiatives such as soliciting competitive bids for ingredients, increasing manufacturing throughput, streamlining our internal fulfillment network, and reducing the cost of our packaging. Workstream owners report on their progress regularly and are held accountable for delivering on their goals.
Our Growth Strategy
•Pursue Top-line Growth Across our Distribution Channels
Subject to the ultimate duration, magnitude and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe there is a significant opportunity over time to continue to expand Beyond Meat beyond our retail and foodservice footprint of approximately 130,000 outlets in more than 90 countries worldwide as of December 2021 through distribution expansion, continued innovation and commercialization of new products, and increased penetration across channels. We believe increased distribution will lead to growing consumer awareness and demand for nutritious, convenient and high protein plant-based foods, leading to an increase in the overall size of the plant-based protein category as more consumers shift their diets away from animal-based proteins.
We have developed a strategy to pursue growth within the following distribution channels:
• U.S. Retail: We plan to grow our sales within U.S. retail by focusing on increasing market share, household penetration, repeat purchases, buying rates (amount spent per buyer) and purchase frequency, sales velocity and new product introductions. As we continue to strive towards price parity with animal-based products, pricing strategy and pack architecture will be important factors in increasing household penetration, 
repeat purchases and buying rates as well as increasing velocity for our retail customers. As of December 2021, our products were available in approximately 34,000 retail outlets in the United States.
• U.S. Foodservice: We plan to continue to expand our network of foodservice partners, including large full service restaurant (“FSR”) and QSR customers, with increased penetration across this channel reflecting a desire by foodservice establishments to add plant-based products to their menus and to highlight these offerings. Through enhanced marketing efforts we intend to continue to build our brand, amplify our value proposition around taste, health and sustainability, serve as a best-in-class partner to strategic and other QSR customers to support product development and category management, and drive consumer adoption of our products. As of December 2021, our products were available in approximately 38,000 foodservice outlets in the United States.
• International Retail: We believe there is significant demand for our products globally in the retail channel. Similar to U.S. retail, we are focused on increasing market share, household penetration, repeat purchases, buying rates (amount spent per buyer) and purchase frequency, sales velocity and new product introductions globally. As of December 2021, our products were available in approximately 30,000 international retail outlets.
• International Foodservice: We plan to continue to expand our network of foodservice partners globally, including large FSR and QSR customers, with increased penetration across this channel reflecting a desire by foodservice establishments to add plant-based products to their menus and to highlight these offerings. As of December 2021, our products were available in approximately 28,000 international foodservice outlets. 
•Invest in Infrastructure and Capabilities
We are committed to prioritizing investment in our infrastructure and capabilities in order to support our strategic expansion plans. In 2021, we continued to make significant investments in hiring the best people, maximizing our supply chain capabilities, investing in innovation, sales and marketing, investing in facilities, both domestically and internationally, and optimizing our systems in order to establish a sustainable market-leading position for the long-term future.
We are continually reviewing opportunities to increase and/or leverage manufacturing capacity across our network, identifying opportunities to increase overall equipment effectiveness, and identifying opportunities to leverage our internal manufacturing and co-manufacturers. We are also investing in new technology to drive higher yield and/or flexibility to better adjust our capacity to our customer demands.
•Expand Our Product Offerings
The success of our products has confirmed our belief that there is significant demand for additional plant-based meat products. We intend to strengthen our product offerings by improving the formulations for our existing portfolio of products and by creating new products that expand the portfolio. We are continually refining our products to improve their taste, texture, aroma and appearance. In addition, we are committed to increasing our investment in research and development to continue to innovate within our core plant-based platforms of beef, pork and poultry to create exciting new product lines and improve the formulations for our existing portfolio of products. 
Our new product launches in 2021 included new versions of the Beyond Burger and Beyond Beef in U.S. foodservice and retail channels, the launch of Beyond Chicken Tenders in U.S. foodservice and retail channels, and the tests of Beyond The Original Orange Chicken and Beyond Pepperoni in the U.S. foodservice channel. New product launches in international channels in 2021 included Beyond Meatballs in the EU; Beyond Breakfast Sausage Links and Beyond Italian Sausage Crumbles (foodservice) in Canada, the test of Beyond Meat Nuggets (foodservice) in Canada, and the test of the McPlant burger in the U.K. and Ireland (foodservice).
•Continue to Grow Our Brand
We intend to continue to develop our brand and increase awareness of Beyond Meat. We plan on highlighting our “Go Beyond” message and the global benefits that come with eating our products. We also plan 
to continue to create relevant content with our network of celebrities, influencers and brand ambassadors, who have successfully built significant brand awareness for us by supporting our mission and products and incorporating Beyond Meat into their daily lifestyle. Subject to the ultimate duration, magnitude and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also intend to resume and expand our field marketing efforts to sample products directly with consumers in stores and at relevant events. 
Our Products 
We sell a range of plant-based meat products across the three core platforms of beef, pork and poultry. Depending on the product and channel, they are offered in ready-to-cook or ready-to-heat formats. All of our products are made from simple ingredients without GMOs, hormones, antibiotics or cholesterol. With the exception of certain Beyond Beef Crumbles which are not certified Kosher, all of our products are certified Kosher and Halal. All of our products are good to excellent sources of protein and we are focused on making them nutritionally dense, with minimal negative attributes relative to their animal protein equivalents. 
Beyond Burger: The Beyond Burger, our flagship product, was our first product merchandised in the meat case of grocery stores in the United States. The Beyond Burger is designed to look, cook and taste like an 80/20 ground beef burger. In 2021, we introduced the latest iteration of our Beyond Burger in the U.S. which offers consumers both a better taste and sensory experience as well as improved nutrition, including B vitamins and minerals comparable to the micronutrient profile of 80/20 beef. It is made from a blend of pea and rice proteins, providing 20 grams of protein per serving and 35% less saturated fat than 80/20 beef. It also has no cholesterol, soy, gluten or GMOs. In addition, we launched a new pack size in 2021 with 4 plant-based patties per tray designed to feed a family and available in the fresh meat aisle. To improve our sustainability footprint and plastic use, this new item is packaged in a new tray made from recycled PET. 
Cookout Classic: In June 2020, in response to COVID-19, we launched our Cookout Classic value packs, a limited edition offering with 10 plant-based burgers per carton available in the frozen aisle, made from a blend of pea and rice proteins, providing 18 grams of protein per serving. In 2021, we made this a permanent item in our product portfolio with 8 plant-based burgers per carton available in the frozen aisle. 
Beyond Beef: Beyond Beef is designed to have the meaty taste and texture of ground beef and replicate the versatility of ground beef. In 2021, we introduced a new iteration of our Beyond Beef with 35% less saturated fat than 80/20 beef or five grams per four-ounce serving. Like our flagship Beyond Burger product, the latest Beyond Beef offers consumers a better taste and sensory experience as well as improved nutrition. Like animal-based ground beef, Beyond Beef can be used in a variety of dishes, such as tacos and meatballs, and is sold to our foodservice partners for use in menu items such as pizza toppings. It is made from a blend of pea and rice proteins, and has no cholesterol, soy, gluten or GMOs.
Beyond Sausage: Beyond Sausage is designed to look, cook and taste like a pork sausage. Beyond Sausage is made from a blend of pea, rice and faba bean proteins. Beyond Sausage’s primary source of protein comes from peas, providing 16 grams of protein and three grams of fiber per serving, and has 35% less saturated fat than the leading pork dinner sausage. It also has no cholesterol, no soy, gluten or GMOs. Beyond Sausage currently comes in three flavors: Brat Original, Hot Italian and Sweet Italian.
Beyond Breakfast Sausage: Beyond Breakfast Sausage Patties and Beyond Breakfast Sausage Links are designed to replicate a classic pork breakfast sausage patty or link. Beyond Breakfast Sausage is made from a blend of pea and rice proteins and seasoned with savory herbs and spices. Beyond Breakfast Sausage Patties provide 11 grams of plant-based protein per serving, and 35% less saturated fat and sodium than the leading pork breakfast sausage, while Beyond Breakfast Sausage Links provide 8 grams of plant-based protein per serving and 40% less sodium than the leading pork breakfast sausage. Each has no cholesterol, soy, gluten or GMOs. 
Beyond Meatballs: Beyond Meatballs are pre-formed and designed to replicate ground beef or pork meatballs. Designed as a convenient meal solution for consumers, Beyond Meatballs are made from a blend of 
pea and rice proteins. They provide 19 grams of protein per serving, and have no cholesterol, soy, gluten or GMOs.
Beyond Beef Crumbles: Beyond Beef Crumbles are ready-to-heat products designed to look and satisfy like minced or ground beef. Beyond Beef Crumbles’ primary source of protein comes from peas, providing 14 grams of protein per serving, and has no soy, gluten or GMOs. Beyond Beef Crumbles currently come in two flavors for retail: Beefy and Feisty. The four flavors available for foodservice are Plain, Beefy, Feisty and Italian Sausage.
Beyond Chicken Tenders: Beyond Chicken Tenders are a plant-based breaded product designed to look and satisfy like animal-based chicken tenders. Beyond Chicken Tenders’ primary source of protein comes from faba beans and they have no cholesterol or GMOs. The ready-to-cook foodservice version launched in July 2021 has 14 grams of protein per serving and 40% less saturated fat than the leading animal-based chicken nugget. The ready-to-heat retail version introduced in September 2021 has 13 grams of protein per serving and 50% less saturated fat than the leading animal based chicken nugget. 
Customers
Since the success of the Beyond Burger, we have created a strong presence at leading food retailers across the United States and abroad. As of December 2021, our products were available in approximately 34,000 retail outlets in the United States and 30,000 retail outlets internationally. Retail channel net revenues in 2021 increased $24.3 million, or 8.1%, as compared to the prior year.
As of December 2021, our products were available in approximately 38,000 foodservice outlets in the United States and 28,000 foodservice outlets internationally. Notwithstanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our foodservice channel since the latter half of March 2020, we remain focused on expanding our partnerships with foodservice customers over time, including large FSR and QSR customers in the United States and abroad. Foodservice channel net revenues in 2021 increased $33.7 million, or 31.7%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in the number of outlets selling our products.
We sell to a variety of customers in the retail and foodservice channels throughout the United States and internationally primarily through distributors who purchase, store, sell and deliver our products. Because such distributors function in an intermediary role, we do not consider them to be direct customers. In addition, we sell directly to customers in the retail and foodservice channels who handle their own distribution. 
For 2021, DOT Foods, Inc. (“DOT”) and Zandbergen WFM accounted for approximately 12% and 11% of our gross revenues, respectively. For 2020, Costco accounted for approximately 13% of our gross revenues. For 2019, DOT and United Natural Foods, Inc. (“UNFI”) accounted for approximately 17% and 16% of our gross revenues, respectively. No other distributor or customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross revenues in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
Our Supply Chain
•Sourcing and Suppliers
The principal ingredient used to manufacture our products is pea protein. We procure the raw materials for our woven protein from a number of different suppliers. Although most of the raw materials we require are typically readily available from multiple sources, we currently have a limited number of suppliers for the pea protein used in our products. 
• Supply Agreements
We have a multi-year sales agreement with Roquette Frères (“Roquette”) for the supply of pea protein which expires on December 31, 2022. We are obligated to purchase certain minimum annual amounts as specified in the agreement. 
Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2021, on February 8, 2022, we amended our supply agreement for pea protein with PURIS Proteins, LLC, or Puris, (the “Puris Agreement”) to extend the term through December 31, 2022. We obtain pea protein under the Puris Agreement on a purchase order basis and have the right to cancel purchase orders if we provide timely written notice. The amount purchased in each quarter of 2022 is mutually agreed upon by us and Puris prior to each quarter and becomes a binding quarterly commitment upon such agreement. We also have the right to be indemnified by Puris and must indemnify Puris in certain circumstances.
We continually seek additional sources of pea protein and other plant-based protein for our products that meet our criteria.
Flavors consist of product flavors that have been developed by our innovation team in collaboration with our supply partners exclusively for us or in collaboration with our foodservice partners. The formulas are then produced by our suppliers for use in our products. Ingredients in our flavors are qualified through trials to ensure manufacturability. Upon receipt of the ingredients, we receive Certificates of Analysis from our suppliers in our quality control process to confirm that our rigorous standards have been met. Flavors are extensively tested prior to introduction to ensure finished product attributes such as taste, texture, aroma and appearance are not negatively impacted.
Other than the pea protein supply agreements described above, we generally do not have long-term supply agreements with our other suppliers. As most of the raw materials we use in our flavors are readily available in the market from many suppliers, we believe that we can within a reasonable period of time make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of an interruption of supply from our vendors. 
Manufacturing
As the first step in our manufacturing process a dry blend containing our plant protein is combined within our manufacturing facility. The dry blend then enters our extruder, where both water and steam are added. We then use a combination of heating, cooling and variations of pressure to weave together the proteins. The formed woven protein is used as the basis of all our products. Next, internally or through our co-manufacturers, we further process the woven protein by combining flavorings and other ingredients, after which the final packaged product is then shipped to distributors or direct to customers. In order to sustain the quality of our products, we have implemented a “define, measure, analyze, improve and control,” or DMAIC, approach to improve, optimize and stabilize our processes and design.
We depend on co-manufacturers for the manufacturing of some of our products. Our co-manufacturers are currently in various locations throughout the United States, as well as Canada and the Netherlands. We continue to explore establishing more of our own internal production facilities domestically and abroad to produce our woven proteins, blends of flavor systems and binding systems, and finished goods, while pursuing additional relationships with co-manufacturers to take advantage of more competitive pricing and availability of our products.
Quality Control
In-process quality checks are performed throughout the manufacturing process, including temperature, physical dimensions and weight. We provide specific instructions to customers and consumers for storing and cooking our products. All products are transported and stored frozen. Frozen products such as Beyond Beef Crumbles and Beyond Breakfast Sausage Patties are intended to be prepared from their frozen state, with cooking instructions enclosed on all packaging.
Retail products sold in the meat case, such as the Beyond Burger, Beyond Sausage, Beyond Beef, Beyond Meatballs and Beyond Sausage Links are shipped to the customer frozen. The customer is provided instructions on ‘slacking,’ which is typically done by moving frozen food to a refrigerator to allow it to slowly and safely thaw before cooking. For this step, retailers must apply a “use by date” sticker to the packaging prior to sale.
Distribution
From our internal manufacturing or co-manufacturing facilities, products are transferred by third-party logistics providers to cold storage facilities or are directly shipped to the customer. International shipments are also handled by third-party logistics providers and in some instances are organized directly by the customer.
At present, we manage loads through Manhattan Active Transportation Management System and FourKites for real-time load tracking and visibility to manage our supply chain through retail distribution. 
Order Fulfillment
Our customer service and logistics functions are responsible for customer-facing activities, order management, customer logistics, 3PL leadership and intra-company distribution. We utilize Oracle NetSuite ERP and integration with our 3PL Cloud interface platforms for these processes. Customer orders are principally transmitted via electronic data interface, or EDI, but may be processed manually if necessary. Orders are accepted in NetSuite, reviewed for accuracy and fulfillment plans are developed. When fulfillment plans are ready, orders are downloaded and emailed to our transportation partners for tendering. Metrics for the Customer Service and Logistics team include order fill, on-time shipping, customer scorecards as needed and cost leadership. We have agreements with third-party service providers for all of our shipping needs.
Sales and In-Store Activation
•Sales
As of December 31, 2021, our sales team is organized into four divisions, retail, foodservice, international and strategic partnerships. Additionally, we have strong support functions with Category Management, Consumer Insights and Analytics, Field and Shopper Marketing and In-Store Activation. The sales team has an extensive range of experience from leading CPG, natural food, meat and plant-based protein companies. It works in close coordination with a network of global broker and distributor partners that gives us the expertise and access to accounts and markets across all key global markets in an efficient and scalable fashion as we continue to grow our footprint and sales globally.
•Field Marketing
Beyond Meat’s global food marketing team drives consumer and customer trial and awareness via "Tasting is Believing” across retail and foodservice channels through in-store sampling, events and trade shows. Our Beyond Meat food trucks deliver a best-in-class sampling experience with customers and consumers while being leveraged for content creation, PR activations and QSR / influencer campaigns.
•Brand Marketing
The primary means by which we have driven consumer awareness of our products is via social and digital media, PR, retail and foodservice shopper marketing, ambassador and influencer activations, paid media and strategic partnerships. Our marketing strategy focuses on driving awareness all the way through to purchase and loyalty. 
We maintain active social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter to build awareness, share news, reach new audiences and engage with our consumers. As of December 31, 2021, we had the largest social media following within the plant-based meat category, and in May 2021 our Instagram account, @beyondmeat, reached one million followers. These platforms allow us to engage with our consumers and directly reach target demographics such as millennials and “Generation Z.” We also maintain an active newsletter, which we use to distribute brand information and news, foster loyalty through unique offers and share recipe content to inspire usage. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 632,000 newsletter subscribers.
We also maintain a registered domain website at www.beyondmeat.com, which serves as the primary source of information regarding our products, as wells as foreign domains in certain countries. Our website is 
used as a platform to promote our products, provide news, share recipes, highlight nutritional facts and provide general information on where to purchase our products. 
We are fortunate to have partnered with a network of brand ambassadors and developed a strong following by celebrities from the worlds of sports and entertainment who share our core values. Their organic involvement and interest are helpful to promote our overall mission, strategic partnerships and Go Beyond brand campaign, which was first launched in 2019 and continues to be a central part of our marketing efforts.
In 2021, we also deployed a mix of targeted paid advertising campaigns to build awareness, reach new users and drive conversion. Our paid digital initiatives included social, programmatic, podcasts, connected TV, and digital offers and rewards. Beginning May 2021, we also ran a robust out-of-home campaign in nine key markets across the United States to support two of our primary seasons—summer grilling and tailgating. 
•Shopper Marketing and In-Store Activation
Our shopper and foodservice marketing team is focused on partnering with our top retailers to build customized in-store activation programs that increase sales, distribution and velocity for the customer and our products while elevating our brand equity. The team is focused on our top strategic foodservice and retail customers who have robust capabilities to engage shoppers across all omni-channel media touchpoints. These programs are focused on driving incremental shopper conversion at retail and foodservice outlets to achieve our planned sales goals.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment. We believe that we compete with both conventional animal-protein companies, such as Cargill, Hormel, JBS, Perdue Foods, Tyson and WH Group, and also plant-based protein brands, including brands affiliated with conventional animal-protein companies and other large food operators, such as Alpha Foods, Boca Foods (Kraft Heinz), Lightlife and Field Roast Grain Meat Co. (Maple Leaf Foods), Gardein (Conagra), Hungry Planet, Inc., Impossible Foods, Incogmeato/Morningstar Farms (Kellogg), Moving Mountains, Omn!pork (OmniFoods), Tofurky, Sweet Earth and Awesome Burger (Nestle’ S.A.), Pure Farmland by Smithfield Foods (WH Group), Raised & Rooted (Tyson), Happy Little Plants (Hormel), Sysco’s Simply Plant-Based Meatless Burger, Tattooed Chef, The Not Company, OZO (Planterra Foods/JBS) and Vegetarian Butcher (Unilever). Additionally, a number of U.S. and international companies are working on developing lab-grown or “clean meat,” an animal-protein product cultivated from cells taken from animals, which could have a similar appeal to consumers as plant-based products. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry are:
• taste;
• nutritional profile;
• ingredients;
• texture;
• ease of integration into the consumer diet;
• low-carbohydrate, low-sugar, high fiber and protein;
• lack of cholesterol, soy, gluten and GMOs;
• convenience;
• price and promotion tactics;
• brand awareness and loyalty among consumers;
• media spending;
• product variety and packaging;
• access to major retailer shelf space and retail locations;
• access to major foodservice outlets and integration into menus; 
• innovation; and
• intellectual property protection on products.
We believe we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors. However, many companies in our industry have substantially greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with distributors and suppliers, longer operating histories, greater production, commercialization and distribution capabilities and greater marketing resources than we have.
Research and Development
Our research and development team creates, tests and refines our products at our Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center. We employ in-house scientists, engineers, researchers and testers to help create the next iterations to plant-based meat products. Our team has delivered a number of first-to-market breakthroughs focused on plant-based meat and we are also focused on continuous improvement of existing products. We have and will continue to protect any intellectual property created by us.
As of December 31, 2021 we employed over 200 scientists, engineers, researchers, technicians and chefs to help create the next generation of food for our consumers.
Our Beyond Meat Rapid and Relentless Innovation Program defines the details of the product innovation process from ideation and prototype development through commercialization. This process assigns responsibility and accountability of each functional team throughout the process and defines deliverables at each step.
Product Innovation
Innovation is a core competency of ours and an important part of our growth strategy. Our goal is to identify large, animal-based meat product categories across our core plant-based platforms of beef, pork and poultry that exhibit long-term consumer trends. We then dedicate significant research and development resources to create authentic plant-based versions of these products that replicate the taste, texture, aroma and appearance of their animal-based equivalents. We have been able to leverage the success of our existing products and resulting brand equity to launch improved versions of our existing products and create new products. We have a range of new products in our pipeline and our goal is to develop at least one new product a year. 
The innovation team undertakes extensive research projects to increase our fundamental understanding of animal-based meat and plant-based equivalents. A few examples of where we are focusing on continued refinements of our products include: 
• Better fat adipose tissue and saturated fat mimics: We are researching new materials and technologies capable of mimicking saturated fat in terms of texture and appearance, but without the nutritional drawbacks of saturated fat.
• Alternative functional proteins: We pursue new non-animal proteins that add function to our food products, including native proteins that can denature during cooking, protein binders and protein emulsifying agents and proteins.
• Additional connective tissue equivalents: We are seeking materials and methods to introduce additional cartilaginous-like materials and heterogeneity in the form of both texture and appearance in our food products.
• Encapsulation materials and technology: We are seeking new materials and technologies to expand the scope of controlled-release delivery systems in our food products as it relates to delivering flavor, color and texturizing agents.
• Materials and technologies to support flavor and texture development: We are seeking non-GMO enzymes that can assist with protein enzymolysis as it relates to flavor reactions.
On January 25, 2021, we entered into The PLANeT Partnership, LLC, a joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., to develop, produce and market innovative snack and beverage products made from plant-based protein. We believe the joint venture will allow us to reach more consumers by entering new product categories and distribution channels, increasing accessibility to plant-based protein around the world.
Seasonality
Generally, we expect to experience greater demand for certain of our products during the summer grilling season. In 2021, U.S. retail channel net revenues during the second quarter were 21% higher than the first quarter. In 2020, the impact of COVID-19 amplified this seasonal impact with U.S. retail channel net revenues increasing 80% compared to the first quarter of 2020. We continue to see additional seasonality effects, especially within our retail channel, with revenue contribution from this channel tending to be greater in the second and third quarters of the year, along with increased levels of purchasing by customers ahead of holidays, the impact of customer shelf reset activity and the timing of product restocking by our retail customers. In an environment of uncertainty from the impact of COVID-19, we are unable to assess the ultimate impact on the demand for our products as a result of seasonality.
Human Capital Resources
•Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,108 full-time employees and 311 full-time contract workers. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. 
•Employee Health and Safety during COVID-19
The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for us. We have established a COVID-19 cross-functional task force that meets regularly and continually monitors and tracks relevant data including guidance from local, national and international health agencies. This task force works closely with our senior leadership team and is instrumental in making critical, timely decisions and is committed to continuing to communicate to our employees as more information is available to share. In response to COVID-19, we have taken, and continue to take, safety measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate.
While our manufacturing facilities and our Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center remained operational, beginning in March 2020 employees at our corporate headquarters began working remotely. Beginning in July 2021, our corporate employees returned to work and were provided a flexible working schedule of working in the office or remotely depending on job responsibilities, company need and performance. Beginning in October 2021, we began requiring headquarters-based employees to return to working in the office. At all of our facilities, we follow current guidelines from local departments of public health and have implemented comprehensive preventative hygienic measures to support the health and safety of our employees. In addition, we strongly encourage face coverings while indoors and have implemented a mandatory vaccine policy absent approved accommodations and regular testing. At our manufacturing facilities, we have implemented a series of physical distancing and hygienic practices to further support the health and safety of our manufacturing employees. Travel and field marketing activities have resumed with instructions to adhere to COVID-19-related guidelines. Illness prevention policies have been updated company-wide to state that no employee may be onsite when experiencing any symptom of illness. Employees must remain home when sick and may not return onsite until symptom-free and must provide a negative COVID-19 certificate 24-hours prior to returning.
•Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to diversity and inclusion across all aspects of our company. We have developed a diversity and inclusion framework that is centered on minimizing subjectivity via data-driven decisions to reduce the risk of bias and ensure that everyone owns responsibility for inclusive behaviors and actions across the organization. We have established hiring principles that focus on our mission to hire people from diverse backgrounds who will add to our culture. In addition, we are actively working on our diversity and inclusion roadmap, which we plan to implement in 2022, that will be focused on 4 pillars: workplace inclusion, employee experience, inclusive brand and community.
•Mission, Culture and Engagement
Everything we do is powered by our mission and core values and our corporate culture reflects that. As a result, we enjoy a highly motivated and skilled workforce committed to our mission and our company. We believe we have a very unique culture which promotes employee engagement. Our employees are driven by our mission which promotes collaboration and innovation. We promote employee engagement by organizing various employee activities that are aligned with our mission, including our weekly “Coffee Talk,” a forum for employee engagement. 
•Total Rewards and Pay Equity
We strive to attract and retain diverse, high caliber employees who raise the talent bar by offering competitive compensation and benefit packages, regardless of their gender, race or other personal characteristics. We regularly review and survey our compensation and benefit programs against the market to ensure we remain competitive in our hiring practices. We provide employee salaries that are competitive and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of their job and their performance. We also review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable. In addition to our competitive salaries, in an effort to enhance our employees’ sense of participation in the company and to further align their interests with those of our stockholders, we offer equity to all of our salaried employees. 
We also offer a variety of comprehensive medical benefits to our employees. In addition to medical benefits, we offer our employees dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid company holidays, paid parental leave, bereavement leave, pet bereavement leave, employee assistance programs, a 401(k) retirement savings plan with company matching contributions, voluntary short-term and long-term disability insurance, and life insurance. 
•Development and Retention
We strive to hire, develop and retain talent that continuously raises the performance bar. We encourage, support and compensate our employees based on our philosophy of recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance. We achieve this by focusing on development, performance, goals and accomplishments in ongoing conversations with our employees. We believe that performance and development is an ongoing process in which all employees should be active participants.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We own domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Our primary trademarks include Beyond Meat, Beyond Burger, Beyond Beef, Beyond Sausage, Beyond Breakfast Sausage, Beyond Chicken, Beyond Fried Chicken, Beyond Meatball, the Caped Steer Logo, Go Beyond, Eat What You Love, The Cookout Classic, The Future of Protein, and The Future of Protein Beyond Meat and design, and are registered or pending trademarks of Beyond Meat, Inc. in the United States and, in some cases, in certain other countries. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brand to our consumers. We have 
applied for or have trademark registrations internationally as well. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets are important to our success.
We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws and through the domain name dispute resolution system. We maintain a registered domain website at www.beyondmeat.com, as wells as foreign domains in certain countries.
We believe our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to our business. As of December 31, 2021, we had two issued patents in the United States and three issued patents outside the United States (U.K., Indonesia and Australia), four pending patent applications in the United States,13 pending international patent applications, one Patent Cooperation Treaty Application and one provisional patent application.
We consider the specifics of our marketing, promotions and products as a trade secret, and information we wish to keep confidential. In addition, we consider proprietary information related to formulas, processes, know-how and methods used in our production and manufacturing as trade secrets, and information we wish to keep confidential. We have taken reasonable measures to keep the above-mentioned items, as well as our business and marketing plans, customer lists and contracts reasonably protected, and they are accordingly not readily ascertainable by the public.
Segments
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by its chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer. We have determined that we operate in one operating segment and one reportable segment, as our CODM reviews financial information presented on an aggregate basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.
Government Regulation 
Along with our co-manufacturers, brokers, distributors and ingredients and packaging suppliers, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations in the United States by federal, state and local government authorities and in Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, China and other jurisdictions by foreign authorities. In the United States, the primary federal agencies governing the manufacture, distribution, labeling and advertising of our products are the FDA and the FTC, and foreign regulatory authorities include Health Canada or the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (“CFIA”) and the authorities of the EU or the EU member states. Under various federal statutes and implementing regulations and foreign requirements, these agencies, among other things, prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety and regulate our product composition, ingredients, manufacturing, labeling and other marketing and advertising to consumers. Among other things, the facilities in which our products and ingredients are manufactured must register with the FDA and any other relevant authorities based on location, comply with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and comply with a range of food safety requirements established by and implemented under the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 and applicable foreign food safety and manufacturing requirements. Federal, state, and foreign regulators have the authority to inspect our facilities to evaluate compliance with applicable requirements. Federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities also require that certain nutrition and product information appear on our product labels and, more generally, that our labels and labeling be truthful and non-misleading and that our marketing and advertising be truthful, non-misleading and not deceptive to consumers. We are also restricted from making certain types of claims about our products, including for example, in the United States, nutrient content claims, health claims, and claims regarding the effects of our products on any structure or function of the body, whether express or implied, unless we satisfy certain regulatory requirements. 
In addition, the United States Congress recently considered (but did not pass) federal legislation, called the Real MEAT Act, that could require changes to our product labeling and marketing, including identifying products as “imitation” meat products. 
In addition to federal regulatory requirements in the United States, certain states impose their own manufacturing and labeling requirements. For example, every state in which our products are manufactured requires facility registration with the relevant state food safety agency, and those facilities are subject to state inspection as well as federal inspection. Further, states can impose state-specific labeling requirements. For example, in 2018, the state of Missouri passed a law that prohibits any person engaged in advertising, offering for sale, or sale of food products from misrepresenting products as meat that are not derived from harvested production livestock or poultry. The state of Missouri Department of Agriculture has clarified its interpretation that products which include prominent disclosure that the product is “made from plants,” or comparable disclosure such as through the use of the phrase “plant-based,” are not misrepresented under Missouri law. Additional states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming, have subsequently passed similar laws, and legislation that would impose specific requirements on the naming of plant-based meat products is currently pending in a number of other states. We believe that our products are manufactured and labeled in material compliance with existing state requirements, including the 2018 Missouri law, and pay close attention to any developments at the state or federal level that could apply to our products and our labeling claims.
We are also subject to the laws of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, China, the European Union (and individual member countries) and the United Kingdom, among others, and requirements specific to those jurisdictions could impose additional manufacturing or labeling requirements or restrictions. For example, in Europe, the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament proposed in May 2019 to reserve the use of “meat” and meat-related terms and names for products that are manufactured from the edible parts of animals. In October 2020, the European Parliament rejected the adoption of this provision. In the absence of European Union legislation, Member States remain free to establish national restrictions on meat-related names. In June 2020, France adopted a prohibition on using names to indicate foodstuffs of animal origin to describe, market, or promote foodstuffs containing vegetable proteins. In October 2021, France published a draft implementing decree that may enter into force by April 2022, to define, for example, the sanctions in case of non-compliance. We do not believe that the new French bill complies with the laws of the European Union, in particular the principle of free movement of goods. We also note that this prohibition has not been appropriately notified to the European Commission, and that as a result the prohibition is in principle non-enforceable. In November 2021, Beyond Meat co-signed a letter from the European Alliance of Plant-Based Foods protesting this law. In October 2021, the Turkish authorities challenged the use of the Caped Longhorn superhero logo, as well as the name “Beyond Meat,” alleging that the consumer is misled as to the characteristics of our products. The local distributor has made a submission that this is an unlawful restriction under the EU-Turkey Free Trade Agreement. In December 2021, the Turkish authorities rejected this submission, and held that references to “plant-based” in combination with “meat” would mislead the consumer. Beyond Meat is actively monitoring these developments, but if adopted, they may require it to change its labeling and advertising.
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, anti-corruption laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Our operations, and those of our co-manufacturers, distributors and suppliers, are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and it is challenging to predict accurately the effect they may have upon the capital expenditures, earnings and our competitive position in the future.
Corporate Information
Beyond Meat, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on April 8, 2011 originally under the name “J Green Natural Foods Co.” On October 5, 2011, we changed our corporate name to “Savage River, Inc.,” with 
“Beyond Meat” being our “doing business as” name. On September 7, 2018, we changed our corporate name to “Beyond Meat, Inc.” 
On May 6, 2019, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 11,068,750 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $25.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $252.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and issuance costs. On August 5, 2019, we completed a secondary public offering (“Secondary Offering”) of common stock, in which we sold 250,000 shares. The shares were sold at a public offering price of $160.00 per share for net proceeds to the Company of approximately $37.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $1.5 million and issuance costs of approximately $1.1 million payable by us. Total Secondary Offering costs paid in 2019 were approximately $2.2 million, of which approximately $1.1 million was capitalized to reflect the costs associated with the issuance of new shares and offset against proceeds from the Secondary Offering. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders in the Secondary Offering. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “BYND.”
On March 5, 2021, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Convertible Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). On March 12, 2021, the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes exercised their option to purchase an additional $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Additional Notes”, and together with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”), and such Additional Notes were issued on March 16, 2021. See Note 8, Debt, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 
On March 2, 2021, in connection with the pricing of the offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the “Base Capped Call Transactions”) with the option counterparties and used $73.0 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes to fund the cost of the Base Capped Call Transactions. On March 12, 2021, in connection with the Additional Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the “Additional Capped Call Transactions”) with the option counterparties and used $11.0 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Additional Notes to fund the cost of the Additional Capped Call Transactions. See Note 8, Debt, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
On January 14, 2020, we registered Beyond Meat EU B.V., in the Netherlands. On April 28, 2020, we registered Beyond Meat (Jiaxing) Food Co., Ltd. in the Zhejiang Province in China. On June 17, 2021, we incorporated our subsidiary, Beyond Meat Canada Inc. in Canada.
On January 25, 2021, we entered into The PLANeT Partnership, LLC (“TPP”), a joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., to develop, produce and market innovative snack and beverage products made from plant-based protein. 
Emerging Growth Company Status
Upon the completion of our IPO, we elected to be an Emerging Growth Company (“EGC”), as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”). An EGC is defined as a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. A company will retain its EGC status until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which it exceeds $1.07 billion in annual gross revenues; (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date it first sold securities pursuant to an initial public offering registration statement; (3) the date on which the EGC has, within the previous three years, issued $1 billion of nonconvertible debt; or (4) the date it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer (an SEC registered company with a public float of at least $700 million).
Effective December 31, 2020, we lost our EGC status and are now categorized as a Large Accelerated Filer based upon the current market capitalization of the Company according to Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we must comply with all financial disclosure and governance requirements applicable to Large Accelerated Filers.
