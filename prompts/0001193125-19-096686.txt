ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

HopFed Bancorp, Inc. 
 HopFed Bancorp, Inc. (the Corporation) is a bank holding company incorporated in the state of Delaware and headquartered in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The Corporations principal business activities are conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Heritage Bank USA, Inc. (the Bank), a Kentucky state chartered commercial bank engaged in the business of accepting deposits and providing mortgage, consumer, construction and commercial loans to the general public through its retail banking offices. The Banks business activities are primarily limited to western Kentucky and middle and western Tennessee. The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions. Deposits at the Bank are insured up to the applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 
 The Bank is a Kentucky commercial chartered bank and is supervised by the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions (KDFI) and the FDIC. Supervision of the Corporation is conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis (FRB). 
 The Bank owns JBMM, LLC, a wholly owned limited liability company which owns and manages the Banks foreclosed assets. The Bank owns Heritage USA Title, LLC, which sells title insurance to the Banks real estate loan customers. The Bank owns Fort Webb LP, LLC, which owns a limited partnership interest in Fort Webb Elderly Housing LP, LLC, a low income senior citizen housing facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The facility offers apartments for rent for those senior citizens who qualify and is managed by the Bowling Green, Kentucky Housing Authority. 
 A substantial majority of the Banks loans are secured by real estate in the western Kentucky and middle and west Tennessee markets. In addition, all properties reported as foreclosed real estate, which the exception of a $37,000 single-family property that is located in Mississippi, are located in the Companys general market area. Accordingly, the ultimate ability to collect on a substantial portion of the Banks loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of foreclosed real estate is susceptible to changes in local market conditions. 
 Announced Agreement to Merge 
 On January 7, 2019, First Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: THFF) (First Financial) and the Company jointly announced the execution of a definitive merger agreement under which the Company will merge into First Financial in a cash and stock transaction. Upon completion of the merger, the Bank will merge into First Financial Bank, N.A. (First Financial Bank), a wholly owned subsidiary of First Financial. 
 Under the terms of the merger agreement, which was unanimously approved by the boards of both Companies, stockholders of the Company may elect to receive either (or a combination of) 0.444 shares of First Financial common stock or $21.00 in cash for each share of the Companys common stock owned. The transaction aggregate payout is subject to proration provisions specified in the merger agreement that provide for a targeted aggregate split of 50% of the Companys common stock being exchanged for First Financial common stock and 50% for cash. Based upon the $43.01 closing price of First Financial common stock on January 4, 2019 and assuming that a shareholder received 50% stock and 50% cash, the purchase price would be worth $20.05 per share, with an aggregate transaction value of approximately $128.3 million. For more information, please review the Companys 8-K/A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated January 9, 2019. The proposed merger is subject to approval of both regulators of both Companies and by a vote of HopFed shareholders. 
Stock Repurchase Activity 
 At December 31, 2018, the Company may purchase 296,380 shares of treasury stock under the currently active repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company purchased 3,620 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $14.06 per share. At December 31, 2018, the Company owns 1,341,980 shares of the Companys common stock as treasury stock at a weighted average price of $12.45 per share. The Companys stock repurchase program remains open but activity has been limited due to merger discussions that were held in 2018. 
2015 HopFed Bancorp, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
 On March 2, 2015, the Company implemented the HopFed Bancorp, Inc. 2015 Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the ESOP) which covers substantially all employees who are at least 21 years old with at least one year of employment with the Bank. Bank contributions used to make the ESOP loan payment replaced matching and profit sharing contributions to the Banks 401(k) Plan. The Companys Board of Directors selected three individuals to serve as trustees, Messrs. Peck, Duvall and Dr. Thomas I. Miller. 
 On March 2, 2015, the ESOP purchased an initial block of 600,000 shares from the Company at a cost of $7,884,000 using the proceeds of the ESOP Loan. In accordance with the ESOP loan documents, the common stock purchased by the ESOP serves as collateral for the ESOP loan. The repayment of the ESOP loan is from discretionary contributions by the Bank to the ESOP and by dividends paid on unearned shares held in the trust over a period ending no later than December 9, 2026. The interest rate on the ESOP Loan is 3.0%. The administrative trustee has custody of the common shares owned by the ESOP. 
 ESOP shares are allocated among participants as the ESOP loan is repaid. The ESOP shares receive dividend payments and dividends on unearned shares may be used to make the ESOP loan payment and for distributions to individuals who are no longer employed by the Bank. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company incurred compensation expense of $633,000 and $706,000, respectively, to fund the ESOP loan payment. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Companys ESOP released 51,856 and 64,032 shares of stock, respectively, to individual employees participating in the plan at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 
 Federal Taxation 
 The Corporation and the Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return on a calendar year basis. The Company is subject to the federal tax laws and regulations that apply to corporations generally. 
Kentucky Taxation 
 Kentucky corporations, such as the Corporation, are subject to the Kentucky corporation income tax and the Kentucky corporation license (franchise) tax. The income tax is imposed based on the following rates: 4% of the first $50,000 of net taxable income allocated or apportioned to Kentucky; 5% of the next $50,000; and 6% of taxable net income over $100,000. All dividend income received by a corporation is excluded for purposes of arriving at taxable net income. 
Tennessee Taxation 
 The Company and all subsidiaries are subject to Tennessee Franchise and Excise tax on apportioned capital and apportioned income.

 Heritage Bank USA, Inc. 
 State banks are not subject to the Kentucky corporation tax. 
 The Commonwealth of Kentucky imposes both a Kentucky Bank Franchise Tax and Local Deposits Franchise Tax. The Kentucky Bank Franchise Tax is an annual tax equal to 1.1% of net capital after apportionment, if applicable. The value of the net capital is calculated annually by deducting from total capital an amount equal to the same percentage of total as the book value of Unites States obligations bears to the book value of the total assets of the financial institution. The Bank, as a financial institution, is exempt from both corporate income and license taxes. 
Competition 
 The Bank faces significant competition both in originating mortgage and other loans and in attracting deposits. The Bank competes for loans based on the types of loans originated, the rates charged and the terms offered on our loan products, the deposit products and rates offered and the convenience and quality of services it provides to customers. The Bank also competes by offering products tailored to the local communities that we serve. Its competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other savings institutions, commercial banks and mortgage bankers making loans secured by real estate located in the Banks market area. Commercial banks, credit unions and finance companies provide vigorous competition in consumer lending. 
 At June 30, 2018, the Bank had an 11.0% share of the deposit market in its combined markets. The Banks most significant competition for deposits across its entire market area was Community Financial Services Bank with a deposit rate share of 12.1% and Planters Bank of Kentucky with a deposit market share of 10.2%. At June 30, 2018, U.S. Bank N/A held a deposit market share of 8.0%, F&M Bank of Clarksville, Tennessee held a market share of 7.4% and Regions Bank of Birmingham, Alabama held a market share rate of 7.1%. In addition, each market contains other community banks that provide competitive products and services within individual markets. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank had 220 full-time equivalent employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers the Banks relationships with its employees to be good.

 Limitations on Capital Distributions. The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which provides that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding companys net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding companys capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The FRB also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. In a recent Supervisory Letter, the FRB staff has stated that, as a general matter, bank holding companies should eliminate cash dividends if net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividend. Furthermore, under the federal prompt corrective action regulations, the FRB may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding companys bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized. 
 Seasonality of Revenues and Expenses 
 The Companys business is not materially affected by seasonality fluctuations in our business cycle. The Companys financial health is substantially affected by the overall business cycle and market interest rates. 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws that relate to the regulation of the Company and the Bank. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. 
 Regulation of the Company 
 General. The Company is a bank holding company registered with the FRB. We are subject to examination and supervision by the FRB pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA), and are required to file reports and other information regarding our business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries with the FRB. 
 Under the BHCA, the Company must obtain the prior approval of the FRB before it may acquire control of another bank or bank holding company, merge or consolidate with another bank holding company, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the Company would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of such shares. 
 
5 


 Non-Banking Activities. In general, the BHCA and the FRBs regulations limit the nonbanking activities permissible for bank holding companies to those activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks to be a proper incident thereto. A bank holding company that elects to be treated as a financial holding company, however, may engage in, and acquire companies engaged in, activities that are considered financial in nature, as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and FRB regulations. These activities include, among other things, securities underwriting, dealing and market-making, sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency activities, and merchant banking. 
 General. A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the policy of the FRB that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding companys failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the FRB to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the FRB regulations, or both. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements. The FRB has adopted regulatory capital regulations pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the BHCA. The Federal Reserves regulatory capital requirements are similar to those imposed on the Bank by the FDIC. See Regulation of the Bank  Regulatory Capital Requirements. The FRB, however, has adopted a policy statement that exempts bank holding companies with less than $1.0 billion in consolidated assets that are not engaged in significant non-banking or off-balance sheet activities and that do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities registered with the SEC from its regulatory capital requirements. As long as their bank subsidiaries are well capitalized, such bank holding companies need only maintain a pro forma debt to equity ratio of less than 1.0 in order to pay dividends and repurchase stock and to be eligible for expedited treatment on applications. 
 Regulation of the Bank 
 General. As a Kentucky-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the KDFI and by the FDIC, which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law. The federal and state laws and regulations applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, the reserves required to be kept against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. The laws and regulations governing the Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the FDIC, not for the purpose of protecting stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the federal and state banking agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the KDFI, the FDIC or the United States Congress, could have a material impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements. The FDIC has promulgated capital adequacy requirements for state-chartered banks that, like the Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve System. Effective January 1, 2015, the regulatory capital rules were substantially revised to conform to the international regulatory standards agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the accord often referred to as Basel III. The final Basel III capital rule applies to all depository institutions as well as to all top-tier bank and savings and loan holding companies that are not subject to the FRBs Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. 
 Under the FDICs revised regulatory capital regulations, the Bank is required to meet four minimum capital standards: (1) a Tier 1 or core capital leverage ratio equal to at least 4% of total adjusted assets, (2) a common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, (3) a Tier 1 risk-based ratio equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets, and (4) a total capital ratio equal to 8% of total risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is defined as common stock instruments, retained earnings, any common equity Tier 1 minority interest and, unless an institution has made an opt-out election, accumulated other comprehensive income, net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Tier 1 or core capital is defined as CET1 capital plus certain qualifying subordinated interests and grandfathered capital instruments. The Bank and Corporation made the opt-out election. 
 
6 


 Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items, which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying subordinated instruments and certain grandfathered capital instruments. An institutions risk-based capital requirements are measured against risk-weighted assets, which equal the sum of each on-balance-sheet asset and the credit-equivalent amount of each off-balance-sheet item after being multiplied by an assigned risk weight. 
 In addition to higher capital requirements, the Basel III capital rule requires banking organizations to maintain a capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over and above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement will be phased in over four years beginning January 1, 2016. The fully phased-in capital buffer requirement will effectively raise the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7% CET1 capital, 8.5% Tier 1 capital and 10.5% total capital on a fully phased-in basis. The capital conservation buffer at December 31, 2017 is 1.25%. In assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only the above numeric factors but also qualitative factors, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. 
 Prompt Correction Action. Under applicable Federal statute, the federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet specified minimum capital requirements. Under the FDICs prompt corrective action regulations, as amended to incorporate the new regulatory capital standards implemented by the final Basel III capital rule, an institution is deemed to be well-capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and a CET1 risk-based ratio of 6.5% or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 
 An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% or greater, and a CET1 risk-based ratio of 4.5% or greater and the institution does not meet the definition of a well-capitalized institution. An institution is under-capitalized if it does not meet one or more of the adequately-capitalized tests. An institution is deemed to be significantly under-capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4%, a Tier 1 leverage ratio that is less than 3%, or a CET1 risk-based ratio of less than 3%. An institution is deemed to be critically under-capitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity, as defined in the regulations, to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. 
 The prompt corrective action regulations provide for the imposition of a variety of requirements and limitations on institutions that fail to meet the above capital requirements. In particular, the FDIC may require any savings institution that is not adequately capitalized to take certain action to increase its capital ratios. If the savings institutions capital is significantly below the minimum required levels of capital or if it is unsuccessful in increasing its capital ratios, the institutions activities may be restricted 
 Deposit Insurance. The Banks deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by June 30, 2020. It is intended that insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more will fund the increase. 
 The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments based on an insured institutions risk rating. The assessment base is the institutions average consolidated assets less average tangible equity. Prior to July 1, 2016, insured institutions were assigned to one of four risk categories based on their examination ratings and capital ratios, and annual assessment rates ranged from 2.5 to 45 basis points of an insured institutions assessment base. 
 Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC amended its assessment regulations for banks with less than $10
 billion in assets to replace the previous risk categories with updated financial ratios that are designed to better predict the risk of failure of insured institutions. The amended rules became effective during the first quarter after the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund reached 1.15% and will remain in effect until the reserve ratio reaches 2.0%. 
 
7 


 The base deposit insurance rates for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion now range from 1.5 to 30 basis points of an institutions assessment base. Under the amended rules, the FDIC uses an institutions weighted average CAMELS component ratings and the following financial measures to determine deposit insurance assessments: Tier 1 leverage ratio; ratio of net income before taxes to total assets; ratio of non-performing loans to gross assets; and ratio of other real estate owned to gross assets. In addition, assessments take into consideration an institutions brokered deposit ratio, one-year asset growth and a loan mix index, which measures the extent to which an institutions total assets include higher risk loans. Assessments are based on an insured institutions classification among four risk categories determined from their examination ratings and capital and other financial ratios. The institution is assigned to a category and the category determines its assessment rate, subject to certain specified risk adjustments. 
 Insured institutions deemed to pose less risk to the deposit insurance fund pay lower assessments, while greater risk institutions pay higher assessments. In February 2011, the FDIC published a final rule under the Dodd-Frank Act to reform the deposit insurance assessment system. Under such final rule, assessments are based on an institutions average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity instead of deposits, which was the FDICs prior practice. The rule revised the assessment rate schedule to establish assessments ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points, based on an institutions risk classification and possible risk adjustments. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 Dividends. The KDFI limits the amount of dividends that can be paid by a state chartered commercial bank to its holding company. The limit is established by adding the current years net income plus the prior two years net income. The Bank must reduce the amount of accumulated net income over the last two years plus the current year by the amount of dividends paid to the Corporation during the same period of time. At December 31, 2018, the Bank could pay an additional cash dividend of approximately $8.0 million to the Corporation without the prior approval of the KDFI. Future earnings of the Bank appropriated to bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes are not available for payment of dividends or other distributions to the Company without payment of taxes at the then current tax rate by the Bank on the amount of earnings removed from the reserves for such distributions. 
 Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Generally, transactions between commercial banks or its subsidiaries and its affiliates are required to be on terms as favorable to the commercial bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain of these transactions, such as loans to an affiliate, are restricted to a percentage of the savings banks capital. Affiliates of the Bank include the Company and any company that is under common control with the Bank. In addition, a commercial bank may not acquire the securities of most affiliates. The KDFI and FDIC have the discretion to treat subsidiaries of commercial banks as affiliates on a case-by-case basis. 
 Certain transactions with directors, officers or controlling persons are also subject to conflict of interest regulations enforced by the KDFI and FDIC. These conflict of interest regulations and other statutes also impose restrictions on loans to such persons and their related interests. Among other things, such loans must generally be made on terms that are substantially the same as for loans to unaffiliated individuals. 
 Reserve Requirements. Pursuant to regulations of the FRB, all FDIC-insured depository institutions must maintain average daily reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts. The Bank met these reserve requirements at December 31, 2018. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Federal Home Loan Bank System consists of 12 district Federal Home Loan Banks subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB). The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to 1% of the aggregate unpaid principal of its home mortgage loans, home purchase contracts, and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, or 5% of its advances (borrowings) from the FHLB, whichever is greater. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement, with a $4.4 million investment in FHLB stock at December 31, 2018.

 Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations, requires insured depository institutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The statute and regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of BSA and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions. Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory enforcement action, may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements. 
 Consumer Protection Laws. In connection with our deposit-taking lending and other activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending and other financial services to various sectors of the economy and population. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws, which include, among others, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Truth in Savings Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The Bank is examined by the FDIC for compliance with these consumer protection rules. 
 In addition, customer privacy statutes and regulations limit the ability of the Bank to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third-parties. These laws require the Bank to provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices and to give our customers an option to prevent the Company from sharing their non-public personal information with non-affiliated third parties or with our affiliates. 
 Community Reinvestment Act. All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (the CRA) and related federal regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of the Bank, the FDIC is required to assess our record of compliance with the CRA. Such assessment is reviewed by the FRB and/or the FDIC when the Company or the Bank makes application for approval of an expansionary proposal, such as a merger or other acquisition of another bank or the opening of a new branch office. The Bank received a satisfactory CRA rating in its most recent assessment by the FDIC.
