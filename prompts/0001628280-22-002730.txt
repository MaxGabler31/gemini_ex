Item 1. Business 
Polaris Inc., formerly known as Polaris Industries Inc., a Minnesota corporation, was formed in 1994 and is the successor to Polaris Industries Partners LP. The terms “Polaris,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” as used herein refer to the business and operations of Polaris Inc., its subsidiaries and its predecessors, which began doing business in 1954. We design, engineer and manufacture powersports vehicles which include, Off-Road Vehicles (ORV), including All-Terrain Vehicles (ATV) and side-by-side vehicles for recreational and utility use, Snowmobiles, Motorcycles, Global Adjacent Markets vehicles, including Commercial, Government and Defense vehicles, and Boats. We also design and manufacture or source parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) related to our vehicles and aftermarket products and services for off-road and on-road vehicles. Our products are sold online and through dealers, distributors, and retail stores principally located in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and Mexico. 
Business Segments 
In 2021, we operated in six business segments; ORV, Snowmobiles, Motorcycles, Global Adjacent Markets, Aftermarket, and Boats. Our products are sold through a network of over 2,500 independent dealers in North America, over 1,500 independent international dealers through over 30 subsidiaries, and over 90 independent distributors in over 120 countries outside of North America. A majority of our dealers and distributors are multi-line and also carry competitor products, however some dealers carry our full line of products and, while relatively consistent, the actual number of dealers carrying our products can vary from time to time. We also sell through a network of brick-and-mortar retail centers. 
On January 1, 2022, the Company began management of its portfolio of businesses under a new basis; changing from the previous basis described herein. Starting in the first quarter of 2022, the Company expects to report its results under the new basis with the following reportable segments: Off-Road, On-Road, Marine, and Aftermarket. The new basis is intended to create a simplified reporting structure to provide better focus and allow for resources to be best leveraged for future growth and profitability improvement.
Off-Road Vehicles: 
ORVs are four-wheel vehicles designed for off-road use and traversing a wide variety of terrain, including dunes, trails, and mud. The vehicles can be multi-passenger or single passenger, are used for recreation in such sports as fishing and hunting and for trail and dune riding, and for utility purposes on farms, ranches, and construction sites. The ORV industry is comprised of ATVs and side-by-side vehicles. Internationally, ATVs and side-by-sides are sold primarily in Western European countries by similar manufacturers as in North America. 
Estimated North America and worldwide ORV industry retail sales are summarized as follows:

 | Twelve months ended December 31,
Estimated* Approximate Industry Sales (in units) | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 
North America ATV retail sales | 285,000 | 345,000 | 260,000
North America side-by-side retail sales | 540,000 | 640,000 | 510,000
North America ORV retail sales | 825,000 | 985,000 | 770,000
Worldwide ATV retail sales | 415,000 | 465,000 | 380,000
Worldwide side-by-side retail sales | 595,000 | 690,000 | 550,000
Worldwide ORV retail sales | 1,010,000 | 1,155,000 | 930,000
*Estimates are unaudited and based on internally generated management estimates, including estimates based on extrapolations from third party surveys of the industries in which we compete. See Market and Industry Data section for additional information.

The side-by-side market has been consistently strong over the past several years primarily due to continued innovation by manufacturers. More recently, and due in part to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen robust consumer demand out-pace supply due to on-going global supply challenges.
In 2021, we continued to be the North America market share leader in Off-Road Vehicles. Our ORV lineup includes the RZR sport side-by-side, the RANGER utility side-by-side, the GENERAL crossover side-by-side, and the Sportsman ATV. The full line spans 121 models, including two-, four- and six-wheel drive general purpose and recreational vehicles. In many of our segments, we offer youth, value, mid-size, premium and extreme-performance vehicles, which 
come in both single passenger and multi-passenger seating arrangements. Key 2021 ORV product introductions included the SPORTSMAN 570 & 1000 RIDE COMMAND EDITIONS, SPORTSMAN 850 ULTIMATE TRAIL EDITION, RANGER KINETIC, RANGER SP 570, RANGER SP 570 NORTHSTAR, RANGER XP 1000 BIG GAME AND WATERFOWL EDITIONS, GENERAL XP TRAILHEAD LE, GENERAL XP TROY LEE DESIGNS LE, RZR 200 EFI, RZR ROCKFORD FOSGATE LE, RZR PRO R, RZR TURBO R, RZR TRAIL, AND RZR TRAIL S EDITIONS.
We design, engineer, produce or supply a variety of replacement parts and Polaris Engineered Accessories for our ORVs. ORV accessories include winches, bumper/brushguards, plows, racks, wheels and tires, pull-behinds, cab systems, lighting and audio systems, cargo box accessories, tracks and oil. We also market a full line of gear and apparel related to our ORVs, including helmets, jackets, gloves, pants and hats. Gear and apparel is designed to our specifications, purchased from independent vendors and sold by us through our dealers, and distributors, and online.
We sell our ORVs directly to a network of over 1,400 dealers in North America and over 1,100 international dealers. Many of our ORV dealers and distributors are also authorized snowmobile dealers. We produce and deliver our products throughout the year based on dealer, distributor, and customer orders. ORV retail sales activity at the dealer level drives orders which are incorporated into each product’s production scheduling. International distributor ORV orders are taken throughout the year. We utilize our Retail Flow Management (RFM) ordering system for ORV dealers, which allows dealers to order daily and create a segment stocking order which helps to reduce order fulfillment times. 
The ORV industry in the United States, Canada and other global markets is highly competitive. As an ORV original equipment manufacturer (OEM), our competition primarily comes from North American and Asian manufacturers. Competition in such markets is based upon a number of factors, including price, quality, reliability, styling, product features and warranties and a manufacturer’s ability to timely produce vehicles in response to increased consumer demand. 
Snowmobiles: 
Snowmobiles have been manufactured under the Polaris name since 1954. We estimate that worldwide industry sales of snowmobiles totaled approximately 135,000, 125,000, and 135,000 units for the seasons ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In 2021, we saw robust demand driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the season ended March 31, 2021, we held the number two market share position for North America. We produce a full line of snowmobiles consisting of 58 models, ranging from youth models to utility and economy models to performance and competition models. Polaris snowmobiles are sold principally in the United States, Canada, Russia and Northern Europe. 
Key model introductions in 2021 included the new Polaris RMK lineup with Matryx Chassis & Slash derivatives 146/155/165 and Polaris Indy XCR on Matryx Chassis. We also launched the PATRIOT BOOST turbo engine for mountain snowmobiles. We also manufacture a snow bike conversion kit system under the Timbersled brand and in 2021 we launched the RIOT 3 TIMBERSLED.
We design, engineer, produce or supply a variety of replacement parts and Polaris Engineered Accessories for our snowmobiles and snow bike conversion kits. Snowmobile accessories include covers, traction products, reverse kits, electric starters, tracks, bags, windshields, oil and lubricants. We also market a full line of gear and apparel for our snowmobiles, including helmets, goggles, jackets, gloves, boots, bibs, pants and hats. Gear and apparel is purchased from independent vendors and sold by us through our dealers, distributors, and online. 
We sell our snowmobiles directly to a network of over 580 dealers in North America, primarily located in the snowbelt regions of the United States and Canada, and over 300 international dealers. We offer a pre-order SnowCheck program in the spring for our customers that assists us in production planning. This program allows our customers to order a true factory-customized snowmobile by selecting various options, including chassis, track, suspension, colors and accessories. Manufacturing of snowmobiles commences in late winter of the previous season and continues through late autumn or early winter of the current season.
The global Snowmobile industry is primarily comprised of North American, Japanese, and Russian competitors. Competitive market share position is driven heavily by product news (styling, technology, performance) and attractiveness of promotional incentives.
Motorcycles: 
Motorcycles are utilized as a mode of transportation as well as for recreational purposes. The industry is comprised of several segments. We currently compete in three segments: cruisers, touring (including 3-wheel), and standard 
motorcycles. Competition in these segments of the motorcycle industry is based on a number of factors, including styling, price, quality, reliability and the dealer network supporting the brand. 
Estimated combined 900cc and above cruiser, touring, and standard market segments (including the moto-roadster Slingshot®) motorcycle industry sales in North America and worldwide are summarized as follows:

 | Twelve months ended December 31,
Estimated* Industry Sales (in units) | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 
North America 900cc cruiser, touring, and standard retail sales | 220,000 | 190,000 | 210,000
Worldwide 900cc cruiser, touring, and standard retail sales | 350,000 | 330,000 | 365,000
*Estimates are unaudited and based on internally-generated management estimates, including estimates based on extrapolations from third party surveys of the industries in which we compete. See Market and Industry Data section for additional information.

In 2021, we held the number two position in North America market share for the 900cc+ category. Our motorcycles lineup includes Indian Motorcycle and Slingshot, a 3-wheel open air roadster. Our 2022 model year line of motorcycles for Indian Motorcycle and Slingshot consists of 34 models. In 2021, Indian Motorcycle launched its all-new 2022 lineup featuring updated technology and new accessories across its cruiser, bagger, and touring models. Included in the 2022 lineup were three newly designed Indian Chief models. Polaris Slingshot launched its all-new 2022 lineup, including the reintroduction of the Slingshot SLR.
We design, engineer, produce or source a variety of replacement parts and accessories for our motorcycles. Motorcycle accessories include saddle bags, handlebars, backrests, exhausts, windshields, seats, oil and various chrome accessories. We also market a full line of gear and apparel for our motorcycles, including helmets, jackets, leathers and hats. Gear and apparel is purchased from independent vendors and sold by us through our dealers and distributors, and online under our brand names.
Indian Motorcycle and Slingshot are distributed directly through independently owned dealers and distributors. Indian Motorcycles are sold through a network of over 200 dealers in North America and over 350 international dealers. Slingshot currently has over 340 dealers globally. We utilize our RFM ordering system for motorcycle dealers, which allows dealers to order daily and create a segment stocking order which helps to reduce order fulfillment times. 
Global Adjacent Markets: 
Our Global Adjacent Markets business designs and manufacturers vehicles that support various commercial work applications and include products in the light-duty hauling, industrial and urban/suburban commuting sub-sectors, as well as tactical defense vehicles. As part of Global Adjacent Markets, our Polaris Adventures business partners with local outfitters to deliver unique ride experiences leveraging many of our global vehicle platforms. We estimate the worldwide target market for our Global Adjacent Markets businesses was over $5.5 billion in 2021, which includes light duty hauling, people movers, industrial, rental, urban/suburban commuting and related quadricycles. 
Our vehicle brands include Goupil, Aixam, and ProXD, offering low emission vehicles, light duty hauling, passenger vehicles and industrial vehicles. Across these brands we offer 48 models. Global Adjacent Markets also includes all government, defense, and business-to-business (B2B) applications of ORV and Snowmobiles outside of our traditional dealer channels. For defense customers, we offer ATVs and side-by-side vehicles with features specifically designed for ultra-light tactical military applications. These vehicles provide versatile mobility for up to nine passengers, and include our DAGOR, Sportsman MV and MRZR models. 
Within Global Adjacent Markets, our businesses each have their own distribution networks through which their respective vehicles are distributed. ProXD is sold through a growing network of over 160 dealers and also direct to customer where permitted. Goupil and Aixam sell directly to customers in France, through subsidiaries in certain Western European countries and through several dealers and distributors for markets outside such countries. The Polaris Adventures network completed over 400,000 rides in over 180 locations in 2021.
Aftermarket: 
Aftermarket parts, garments and accessories are sold through a highly fragmented industry, which includes dealers, aftermarket e-commerce, big box retailers, distributors and specialty 4x4 retailers. We estimate the market for Jeep and truck aftermarket accessories was approximately $8.5 billion in 2021, and the market for Powersports aftermarket parts, garments and accessories was approximately $5.0 billion in 2021. 
Our aftermarket portfolio of brands include Transamerican Auto Parts (“TAP”), which is a vertically integrated manufacturer, distributor, retailer and installer of off-road Jeep and truck accessories. TAP-owned brands include 4WP, 4 
Wheel Parts, Pro Comp, Smittybilt, Rubicon Express, G2 Axle & Gear, Poison Spyder, Trail Master, 4WP Factory, and LRG. We compete primarily in North America and our competition is highly fragmented across the retail and online channels. TAP sells through its retail stores, call center, and e-commerce sites, while also supporting numerous independent accessory retailers/installers through their wholesale distribution network. TAP conducts business through a three-pronged sales, service, and manufacturing paradigm. TAP has 101 brick-and-mortar retail centers, staffed with experienced product and installation specialists. TAP’s omni-channel retail strategy includes a significant e-commerce business with 4WheelParts.com and 4WD.com. The TAP e-commerce network facilitates consumer sales, service and support, including “pick up in store.” 
Other brands within our aftermarket portfolio include Kolpin, Pro Armor, Klim, 509, and Trail Tech. Aftermarket brands in our off-road category include Kolpin, a lifestyle brand specializing in purpose-built and universal-fit accessories for a variety of off-road vehicles and off-road outdoor enthusiasts, and Pro Armor, a lineup that specializes in accessories for performance side-by-side vehicles and ATVs. Aftermarket brands in our Apparel category include Klim, which specializes in premium technical riding gear for snowmobile, motorcycle and off-road activities, and 509, which is an aftermarket leader in snowmobile and off-road apparel, helmets and goggles. Kolpin Outdoors, Pro Armor and Trail Tech are marketed through Apex Product Group, a unified sales, customer service, distribution and vertically integrated manufacturing organization. Apex brands allow us to access customers through strategic retail and e-commerce marketplaces, as well as dealerships (Polaris and non-Polaris) to reach owners of Polaris and other OEM’s products. Klim and 509 each have their own dealer/distributor networks. 
Boats: 
Our boats are designed to compete in key segments of the recreational marine industry, specifically pontoon and deck boats. Inclusive of the segments in which we compete, we estimate total U.S. 2021 powerboats market sales were approximately $13.5 billion, with pontoon being one of the largest segments therein.
Our brands include Bennington, Godfrey, and Hurricane, which together provide a full offering of pontoon and deck boats. These brands are strategically positioned with over 500 base models across a range of price points. We also offer custom layouts and features and work with numerous engine manufacturers enabling customers to build a boat that meets their specifications. We believe that the combination of our Bennington and Godfrey brands is projected to be the market share leader in pontoon boats.
In a highly fragmented industry, our extensive, experienced and loyal network of over 600 active dealers is a competitive advantage, helping to generate steady demand. Concentrated primarily in North America, this dealer network is organized into distinct sales territories supported by experienced sales representatives and leadership. Through the use of offseason incentive programs, we adhere to level production throughout the year, minimizing disruption to the workforce and vendor network. 
Financial Services Arrangements
Floor plan financing. We have arrangements with Polaris Acceptance (United States), a joint venture between Polaris and a subsidiary of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo affiliates (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China and New Zealand), and a subsidiary of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated to provide floor plan financing for many of our dealers. A majority of our North America sales of ORVs, snowmobiles, motorcycles, boats, and related PG&A are financed under these arrangements whereby we are paid within a few days of shipment of our product. We participate in the cost of dealer financing and have agreed to repurchase products from the finance companies under certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations. We have not historically been required to repurchase a significant number of units. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these financial services arrangements.
Customer financing. We do not offer consumer financing directly to the end users of our products. Instead, we have agreements in place with third-party financing companies to provide financing services to those end consumers. 
Manufacturing and Distribution Operations 
Our products are primarily assembled at our 20 global manufacturing facilities, many of which are shared across business segments. We are vertically integrated in several key components of our manufacturing process, including plastic injection molding, precision machining, welding, clutch assembly and painting. Raw materials and other component parts are purchased from third-party vendors. We have a long-term supply contract with a boat engine manufacturer, which requires a certain volume of total engine purchases, and includes favorable pricing, as well as various growth and volume incentives.  
Contract carriers ship our products from our manufacturing and distribution facilities to our customers. We maintain several leased wholegoods distribution centers where final set-up and up-fitting is completed for certain models before shipment to dealers, distributors, and customers. 
Our products are distributed to our dealers, distributors, and customers through a network of over 40 distribution centers, including third-party providers. 
Sales and Marketing 
Our marketing activities are designed primarily to promote and communicate with consumers to enable the marketing and selling efforts of our dealers and distributors globally. We make available and advertise discount or rebate programs, retail financing or other incentives for our dealers and distributors to remain price competitive to accelerate retail sales to consumers. We advertise our brands directly to consumers via digital, television, print, out of home, radio, events and sponsorships. We utilize public relations and partnerships to drive earned media. We provide advertising assets and content and partially underwrite dealer and distributor advertising to a degree and on terms which vary by brand and from year to year. We also provide print materials, signage and other promotional items for use by dealers. We spent $584.8 million, $544.3 million and $559.2 million for sales and marketing activities in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our corporate headquarters facility is in Medina, Minnesota, and we maintain numerous sales and administrative facilities across the world.
Engineering, Research and Development, and New Product Introduction 
We have over 1,400 employees who are engaged in the development and testing of existing products and research and development of new products and improved production techniques, located primarily in Roseau, Minnesota, Wyoming, Minnesota, Chula Vista, California, Elkhart, Indiana, Burgdorf, Switzerland, and Bangalore, India. 
We utilize internal combustion engine testing facilities to design engine configurations for our products. We utilize specialized facilities for matching engine, exhaust system and clutch performance parameters in our products to achieve desired fuel consumption, power output, noise level and other objectives. Further, we are currently executing an electrification initiative to position the Company as a leader in powersports electrification. Our engineering department is equipped to make small quantities of new product prototypes for testing and for the planning of manufacturing procedures. In addition, we maintain numerous facilities where each of the products is extensively tested under actual use conditions. We utilize our Wyoming, Minnesota facility for engineering, design and development personnel for our line of engines and powertrains, ORVs, motorcycles, and certain Global Adjacent Market vehicles, and our Roseau, Minnesota facility for our snowmobile, ATV and powertrain research and development. We utilize our Elkhart, Indiana facility for engineering, design and development for our boats research and development. We also own Swissauto Powersports Ltd., an engineering company that develops high-performance and high-efficiency engines and innovative vehicles. 
Intellectual Property 
Our products are marketed under a variety of valuable trademarks. Some of the more important trademarks used in our global operations include POLARIS, RANGER, RZR, GENERAL, SPORTSMAN, INDIAN MOTORCYCLE, SLINGSHOT, BENNINGTON, KLIM, and 4 WHEEL PARTS. We protect these marks as appropriate through registrations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use.
We continue our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products, many of which use proprietary expertise, trade secrets, and know-how. We consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.
Product Safety & Regulatory Affairs
Federal, state/provincial and local governments around the world have promulgated and/or are considering promulgating laws and regulations relating to product safety and consumer use. For example: (i) the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to snowmobiles, snow-bikes and off-road vehicles, (ii) the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to motorcycles and Slingshot, and (iii) and the U.S. Coast Guard and its foreign equivalents have oversight of our Boats products, which are subject to marine safety regulations for boats. In addition, we design our products to comply with various applicable voluntary safety standards promulgated by industry associations. While we 
are currently effectively managing compliance with these various regulatory schemes and standards around the world, changes in the regulatory climate in any of the jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our total sales, financial condition, profitability, or cash flows. For a more detailed discussion of these risks, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. 
Human Capital Management
Best Team, Best Culture is a Polaris guiding principle. Our employees are also among our largest shareholder groups, driven by our Employee Stock Ownership Plan and our equity compensation program. Our greatest asset is our employees and we are committed to providing a diverse and engaging work environment and we aim to leverage our Polaris values to drive a positive culture. 
Employee well being. We believe the health, safety, and financial security of our employees drives our success and it is a key focus of our guiding principles. Over the last year, our strong safety culture remained primary while navigating the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continued to identify and implement safety controls to protect employees working onsite. The agility of our employee base remained an advantage, as many employees operated in hybrid work environments. With employee well-being as a focus, we shared resources for employees to manage remote work, support mental health, and balance parental and other family responsibilities.
Employee engagement. As a core element of our human capital management strategy, we deployed our bi-annual engagement survey to our global salaried employees. Our strong employee response was indicative of our engagement, with 96% of employees participating in the survey. Survey results showed a strong level of engagement across our employees, and our overall scores were in the top quartile compared with a best-in-class global normative database, on par with high performing company norms.
Leadership Development. As a part of our growth strategy, we are committed to strategically and intentionally developing our current employees to become the next generation of leaders through external partnerships and employee development programs such as Succeeding as a Polaris Leader and Polaris Leadership Development 1 and 2. These programs provide high potential employees opportunities to grow and prepare for next-level roles. In 2021, our investment in leadership development continued. We scaled virtual leadership training to a larger number of leaders than prior years and disseminated manager tools to enhance effectiveness.
We also remained committed to focused development for early career talent. We revamped our 2021 internship programs to support both onsite and remote interns, and we created weekly hybrid development opportunities for our early talent. We believe our internship programs provide a strong talent pipeline to our early career functional development programs across engineering, operations, sales, marketing, finance, human resources, and information services. Each development program consists of structured rotations and additional formal development, accelerating our talent pipeline.
Commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is another focus of our guiding principle of Best Team, Best Culture. Fostering an environment that ensures equal opportunity and truly values individual differences drives the success of our business. Polaris thrives when it empowers and values the unique skills, perspectives, and contributions of each employee. In 2020, we made a corporate commitment to the CEO Action Pledge for Diversity & Inclusion, which outlines specific sets of actions designed to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. To further this work, we created and deployed a multi-year strategy, R.I.D.E Together. R.I.D.E. Together encompasses our commitment to Respect, Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity, with our assertion that we will make meaningful progress leveraging our full workforce (Together). We deployed leadership tools to drive inclusive team conversations, and we leveraged our Employee Engagement Survey to evaluate additional opportunities to build an inclusive culture. We are members of the Corporate Partnership Council of the Society of Women Engineers which promotes opportunities for development for our team and helps build a pipeline for future talent.
Headcount. Due to the seasonality of our business and certain changes in production cycles, total employment levels vary throughout the year. Despite such variations in employment levels, employee turnover has not been materially disruptive to operations. As of December 31, 2021, on a worldwide basis, we employed over 16,000 full-time persons. Approximately 5,000 of our full-time employees are salaried.
