ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Business development
 
Liberty Star Uranium & Metals Corp. (the “Company”, “we” or “Liberty Star”) was formerly Liberty Star Gold Corp. and formerly Titanium Intelligence, Inc. (“Titanium”). Titanium was incorporated on August 20, 2001 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On February 5, 2004, we commenced operations in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties business. In April 2007, we changed our name to Liberty Star Uranium & Metals Corp. Hay Mountain Holdings, LLC, (formerly known as Hay Mountain Super Project LLC) our wholly owned subsidiary, serves as the primary holding company for development of the potential ore bodies encompassed in the Hay Mountain area of interest in Arizona. In April 2019, we formed the first company intended for engagement with future venture partners named Earp Ridge Mines LLC. On August 13, 2020, the Company formed Red Rock Mines, LLC (“Red Rock”), an Arizona corporation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hay Mountain Holdings, LLC. We are in the exploration phase of operations and have not generated any revenues from operations.
 
Our current business
 
We are engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties in the state of Arizona and the Southwest USA. Claims in the state of Arizona are held in the name of Liberty Star. We use the term “Super Project” to indicate a project in which numerous mineral targets have been identified, any one or more of which could potentially contain commercially viable quantities of minerals. Our significant projects are described below.
 
Tombstone Super Project (“Tombstone”): Tombstone is located in Cochise County, Arizona and covers the Tombstone caldera and its environs. Within the Tombstone caldera is the Hay Mountain target and Red Rock Canyon target. We are concentrating our work at Red Rock Canyon at this time. We plan to ascertain whether the Tombstone, Hay Mountain claims possess commercially viable deposits of copper, molybdenum, gold, silver, lead, zinc, manganese and other metals including Rare Earth Elements (REE’s). We have not identified any ore reserves to date, although we have identified areas which are material of economic interest.
 
Title to mineral claims involves certain inherent risks due to difficulties in determining the validity of certain claims, as well as potential for problems arising from the frequently ambiguous conveyancing history characteristic of many mineral properties. We have investigated title to all the Company’s mineral properties and, to the best of its knowledge, title to all properties retained are in good standing.
 
The mineral resource business generally consists of three stages: exploration, development and production. Mineral resource companies that are in the exploration stage have not yet found mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities and are engaged in exploring land in an effort to discover them. Mineral resource companies that have located a mineral resource in commercially exploitable quantities and are preparing to extract that resource are in the development stage, while those engaged in the extraction of a known mineral resource are in the production stage. We have not found any mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities.

There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our properties, and further exploration is required before we can evaluate whether any exist and, if so, whether it would be economically feasible to develop or exploit those resources. Even if we complete our current exploration program and we are successful in identifying a mineral deposit, we would be required to spend substantial funds on further drilling and engineering studies before we could know whether that mineral deposit “material of economic interest” will constitute a commercially viable mineral deposit, known as an “ore reserve.”
 
To date, we have not generated any revenues. Our ability to pursue our business plan and generate revenues is subject to our ability to obtain additional financing, and we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to do so.
 
The extent to which the coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) impacts our businesses will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our operations may be materially adversely affected.
 
Competition
 
We are a mineral resource company engaged in the business of mineral exploration. We compete with other mineral resource exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in mineral resource exploration companies. The presence of competing mineral resource exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our property acquisitions and exploration programs if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on the merit of the mineral properties under investigation and the price of the investment offered to investors.
 
We also compete for mineral properties of merit with other exploration companies. Competition could reduce the availability of properties of merit or increase the cost of acquiring additional mineral properties.
 
Many of the resource exploration companies with whom we compete may have greater financial and technical resources than we have. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of properties of merit and on exploration of their properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of resource properties. This competition could result in our competitors having resource properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and to senior exploration companies that may purchase resource properties or enter into joint venture agreements with junior exploration companies. This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance property acquisitions and further exploration.

Compliance with Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the State of Arizona and all other States in which we plan to operate.
 
We are required to pay annual rentals for our federal lode mining claims for the Tombstone project in the State of Arizona. The rental period begins at noon on September 1st through the following September 1st and rental payments are due by the first day of the rental period. As listed on the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) web site, new claims located on or after September 1, 2019 cost $255 each which includes processing, location, and maintenance fees. The annual rentals are $165 per claim after the first year. The rentals due by September 1, 2022 for the period from September 1, 2022 through September 1, 2023 of $15,345 have not been paid yet, however, we plan to pay these fees prior to the due date. All rentals during the year ended January 31, 2022 have been paid.
 
We are required to pay annual rentals for our Arizona State Land Department Mineral Exploration Permits (“AZ MEP”) at our Tombstone Hay Mountain project in the State of Arizona. AZ MEP permits cost $500 per permit per year in non-refundable filing fees and are valid for 1 year and renewable for up to 5 years. The rental fee is $2.00 per acre for the first year, which includes the second year, and $1.00 per acre per year for years three through five. The minimum work expenditure requirements are $10 per acre per year for years one and two and $20 per acre per year for years three through five. If the minimum work expenditure requirement is not met the applicant can pay the equal amount in fees to the Arizona State Land Department to keep the AZ MEP permits current. The rental period begins on the date of acceptance for each permit. Rental payments are due by the first day of the rental period. We hold AZ MEP permits for 15,793.24 acres at our Tombstone project. We plan to pay filing and rental fees for our AZ MEPs before their respective due dates in the amount of $29,354.65. All fees and expenditures due during the year ended January 31, 2022 have been paid.
 
With respect to the foregoing properties, additional approvals and authorizations may be required from other government agencies, depending upon the nature and scope of the proposed exploration program. The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the size, quality of any resource or reserve at this time, and it is extremely difficult to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on earnings or our competitive position.
 
Personnel
 
Our CEO & President, Brett Gross was elected by the Board on December 7, 2018. The Board also elected Pete O’Heeron as Chairman of the Board. We also employ one full time CFO who is also our VP of Finance, one full time Geo-tech, who is also our Manager of Field Operations, one Investor Relations Representative and one consultant CPA on an as needed basis. We hire consultants for investor relations, exploration, derivative accounting, and administrative functions also on an as needed basis.
