ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Background.
 
Wellness Center USA, Inc. (“WCUI” or the “Company”) was incorporated in June 2010 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We initially engaged in online sports and nutrition supplements marketing and distribution. We subsequently expanded into additional businesses within the healthcare and medical sectors through acquisitions, including Psoria-Shield Inc. (“PSI”) and StealthCo Inc. (“SCI”), d/b/a Stealth Mark, Inc.
 
The Company currently operates in two business segments: (i) distribution of targeted Ultra Violet (“UV”) phototherapy devices for dermatology and sanitation purposes; and (ii) authentication and encryption products and services. The segments are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, PSI and SCI.
 
PSI
 
PSI was incorporated under the laws of the state of Florida on June 17, 2009. We acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock in PSI on August 24, 2012.
Joint Ventures
 
PSI
 
In December 2018, PSI entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with GEN2 for further development, marketing, licensing and/or sale of PSI technology and products to be conducted through NEO Phototherapy, Inc. (“NEO”). PSI and GEN2 were the members of NEO, owning 50.5% and 36.0%, respectively. As of September 30, 2019, GEN2 had received $975,000 of investments to contribute to NEO. As of April 30, 2020, the Company controlled 51% of the joint venture, GEN2 controlled 39% and another individual controlled the remaining 10%.
 
Effective April 30, 2020, the joint venture with GEN2 was reorganized. GEN2 shareholders exchanged their common shares in GEN2, and the individual exchanged his membership interests in NEO, for common shares representing 49% ownership in PSI. The Company retained its common shares in PSI, which provides the Company a 51% economic interest in the PSI technology and products developed by the joint venture. During the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, PSI recorded a loss of $683,986 and $333,809, respectively, relating to its operations, of which $335,153 and $163,556, respectively, was allocated to the non-controlling interest.
 
As of September 30, 2019, GEN2 had received $975,000 of investments to contribute to NEO. Repayment of the $975,000 investment will begin through and upon the date which PSI has realized and retained cumulative net income/distributable cash in the amount of $300,000. The minority interest of PSI ownership consists of accredited investors, and investment participation of $750,000 from several WCUI officers and directors, including Calvin R. O’Harrow and Roy M. Harsch.
 
Protec
 
In May 2020, the Company’s subsidiary, PSI, agreed to become a majority shareholder in Protec Scientific, Inc. (“Protec”), a company formed in April 2020. As of September 30, 2020, PSI had contributed $191,000 to Protec with the Company’s share being approximately 32%, based on its PSI ownership. The remaining 30% share is attributed to PSI’s minority shareholders. During the year ended September 30, 2020, Protec received an additional $120,000 from non-affiliated investors. The additional investments gave the non-controlling interests a 68% ownership interest in Protec. During the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, Protec recorded a loss of $271,131 and $172,174, respectively, of which $185,399 and $117,732, respectively, was allocated to the non-controlling interests.
 
Psoria-Light
 
PSI designs, develops and markets a targeted ultraviolet (“UV”) phototherapy device called the Psoria-Light. The Psoria-Light is designated for use in targeted PUVA photochemistry and UVB phototherapy and is designed to treat certain skin conditions including psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis (eczema), seborrheic dermatitis, and leukoderma.
 
Psoriasis, eczema, and vitiligo, are common skin conditions that can be challenging to treat, and often cause the client significant psychosocial stress. Clients may undergo a variety of treatments to address these skin conditions, including routine consumption of systemic and biologic drug therapies which are highly toxic, reduce systemic immune system function, and come with a host of chemotherapy-like side effects. Ultraviolet (UV) phototherapy is a clinically validated alternate treatment modality for these disorders.

Traditionally, “non-targeted” UV phototherapy was administered by lamps that emitted either UVA or UVB light to both diseased and healthy skin. While sunblocks or other UV barriers may be used to protect healthy skin, the UV administered in this manner must be low dosage to avoid excessive exposure of healthy tissue. Today, “targeted” UV phototherapy devices administer much higher dosages of light only to affected tissue, resulting in “clearance” in the case of psoriasis and eczema, and “repigmentation” in the case of vitiligo, at much faster rates than non-targeted (low dosage) UV treatments.
 
Targeted UV treatments are typically administered to smaller total body surface areas, and are therefore used to treat the most intense parts of a client’s disease. Non-targeted UV treatment is typically used as a follow-up and for maintenance, capable of treating large surfaces of the body. Excimer laser devices (UVB at 308nm) are expensive and consume dangerous chemicals (Xenon and Chlorine). Mercury lamp devices (UVB and/or UVA) require expensive lamp replacements regularly and require special disposal (due to mercury content). Additionally, mercury lamp devices typically deliver wavelengths of light below 300nm. While within the UVB spectrum, it has been shown that wavelengths below 300nm produce significantly more “sunburn” type side effects than do wavelengths between 300 and 320nm without improvement in therapeutic benefit.
 
The Psoria-Light is a targeted UV phototherapy device that produces UVB light between 300 and 320 nm as well as UVA light between 350 and 395nm. It does not require consumption of dangerous chemicals or require special environmental disposal, and is cost effective for clinicians, which should result in increased patient access to this type of treatment. It has several unique and advanced features that we believe will distinguish it from the non-targeted and targeted UV phototherapy devices that are currently being used by dermatologists and other healthcare providers. These features include the following: the utilization of deep narrow-band UVB (“NB-UVB”) LEDs as light sources; the ability to produce both UVA or NB-UVB therapeutic wavelengths; an integrated high resolution digital camera and client record integration capabilities; the ability to export to an external USB memory device a PDF file of treatment information including a patent pending graph that includes digital images plotted against user tracked metrics which can be submitted to improve medical reimbursements; an accessory port and ability to update software; ease of placement and portability; advanced treatment site detection safety sensor; international language support; a warranty which includes the UV lamp(s); and a non-changeable treatment log (that does not include HIPPA information).
 
The Psoria-Light consists of three components: a base console, a color display with touchscreen control, and a hand-held delivery device with a conduit (or tether) between the handheld device and the base console. PSI requires clearance by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to market and sell the device in the United States as well as permission from TUV SUD America Inc., PSI’s Notified Body, to affix the CE mark to the Psoria-Light in order to market and sell the device in countries of the European Union.
 
To obtain FDA clearance and permission to affix the CE mark, PSI was required to conduct EMC and electrical safety testing, which it completed in the second quarter of 2011. PSI received FDA clearance on February 11, 2011 (no. K103540) and was granted permission to affix the CE mark on November 10, 2011. In its 510(k) application with the FDA (application number K103540), PSI asserted that the Psoria-Light was “substantially equivalent” in intended use and technology to two predicate devices, the X -Trac Excimer Laser, which has wide acceptance in the medical billing literature and has a large installed base in the U.S., and the Dualight, another competing targeted UV phototherapy device.
 
PSI has established an ISO 13485 compliant quality system for the Psoria-Light, which was first audited in the third quarter of 2011. This system is intended to ensure PSI devices will be manufactured in a controlled and reliable environment and that its resources follow similar practices and is required for sales in countries requiring a CE mark. PSI has also received Certified Space Technology designation from the Space Foundation, based on PSI’s incorporation of established NASA-funded LED technology.
 
PSI began Psoria-Light Beta deployment in January 2012. It is currently operating at a loss, and there is no assurance that its business development plans and strategies will ever be successful. PSI’s success depends upon the acceptance by healthcare providers and clients of Psoria-Light treatment as a preferred method of treatment for psoriasis and other UV-treatable skin conditions. Psoria-Light treatment appears to have been beneficial to clients, without demonstrable harmful side effects or safety issues, as evidenced by more than 10,000 treatments completed on more than 1,000 clients, domestically and Mexico, since 2012. In order for the Company to continue PSI operations, it will need additional capital and it will have to successfully coordinate integration of PSI operations without materially and adversely affecting continuation and development of other Company operations.
 
SCI
 
SCI was incorporated under the laws of the state of Illinois on March 18, 2014. SCI acquired certain Stealth Mark assets on April 4, 2014 and operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. It is a provider of: a) Stealth Mark encryption and authentication solutions offering advanced technologies within the security and supply chain management vertical sectors (Intelligent Microparticles), and b) advanced data intelligence services offering proprietary, unprecedented, and actionable technology for industries, companies, and agencies on a global scale (ActiveDuty™).

Intelligent Microparticles
 
SCI provides clients premiere authentication technology for the protection of a variety of products and brands from illicit counterfeiting and diversion activities. Its technology is applicable to a wide range of industries affected by counterfeiting, diversion and theft including, but not limited to, pharmaceuticals, defense/aerospace, automotive, electronics, technology, consumer and personal care goods, designer products, beverage/spirits, and many others.
 
SCI delivers the client a complete, simple to use, easy to implement, and cost effective turnkey system that is extremely difficult to compromise. SCI’s technology includes a combination of proprietary software and intelligent microparticle marks that are unduplicatable and undetectable to the human eye. These taggants are created with proprietary materials that create unique numerical codes that are assigned meaning by the client and are machine readable without the use of rare earth or chemical tracers. They have been used in covert and overt operations with easy to implement technology and do-it-yourself in-the-field forensic caliber verification.
 
In April 2018, the Company’s subsidiary, SCI, concluded licensing of a patent for technology that is the next generation of Stealth Mark. Working with researchers at the Oak Ridge National Labs, the patent signifies development of a new technology that will generate an invisible marking system with attributes currently unavailable in the anti-counterfeit marketplace today. The formula and techniques have been shown through extensive testing to be resilient to manufacturing processes and can be used on a wide range of materials from woven and non-woven fabrics, cardboard, metal, concrete, plastics, leather, wood, and paper. In addition, the complexity of the information that can be encoded with the system makes counterfeiting difficult.
 
ActiveDuty™
 
SCI’s ActiveDuty™ data intelligence services offer unique, unprecedented, actionable technology for industries, companies, and agencies on a global scale. Comprised of a suite of powerful analytical tools, including artificial intelligence and social-psychology, the service provides timely and actionable intelligence to clients. ActiveDuty™ is adaptable to a broad spectrum of illicit activities within both private and public sectors such as, but not limited to, counterfeiting, sex and human trafficking, money laundering, and a variety of other markets.
 
The proprietary algorithmic architecture of ActiveDuty™ creates the first systemic reporting mechanism to deliver strategic and tactical results supported by an intense worldwide analysis of patterns of human behavior. The ActiveDuty™ global framework is heuristic in nature, capable of comprehending big data across the digital spectrum and speaks all the major languages. Up until now, there has not existed a unified system that could actively measure this lifecycle that is a collection of discreet and seemingly random behaviors of criminals anywhere within the digital domain. Criminals change their identities but not their basic behaviors.
 
SCI was managed initially by Ricky Howard, who brought over thirty years of experience in operations management and executive positions in a variety of industries ranging from entrepreneurial startups to Fortune 500 companies. He played an integral role in bringing the company’s capabilities to its present status including design and creation of its manufacturing capabilities, implementation of its ERP inventory controls system, software and hardware development, marketing and sales materials processes and day-to-day operational procedures and processes. In November 2018, Mr. Howard passed away suddenly and Mr. O’Harrow took over operations of SCI’s business on an interim basis.
