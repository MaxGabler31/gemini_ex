Marketing
 We plan to use different marketing tools to promote our services within China. Our key marketing tools that we plan to use are the following: Internet marketing (online marketing), direct sales, presentations and exhibitions, publications in catalogues and specialized issues. In order to focus on our potential clients, we plan to develop our own catalogue with a base of production companies in China categorized by industries and types of activity.
 We project that one of the priorities tools of our marketing company will be the creation of a website as well as separate landing pages that will target different types of clients. Moreover, we plan to develop a catalogue of manufacturers based on our website and forum that will help to resolve frequent issues concerning business organizations with Chinese manufacturers. We plan to create a multilingual site, at least, in English, Spanish, German and Chinese.
 We plan to place our web banners on manufacturers websites, international commercial web forums, social networks, and business communities. In addition, we plan to post information on websites of trading and consulting associations and on electronic trading platforms such as Aliexpress and Taobao.
 Context advertising based on different search platforms such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, AOL and others is equally important for Internet marketing to attract users who search information using such requests as business in China, consulting in China, Search for manufacturers in China and other requests associated with a range of services provided by us. Payment for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) service will allow us to be on the first pages in popular requests concerning our business.
 Upon a successful launch of our website, we plan to create pages in social networks (Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Facebook) to make sure that our potential clients have complete information about provided services, promotions and offers.
 By means of direct sales, we plan to close in on only those clients who are interested in our service. We plan to use direct mail, personal meetings and consultations.
 Participation in exhibitions and events hosted by production plants will allow us to present our company to those visitors who are more interested in business with China and, subsequently, find potential clients.
 
Clients
 Our service targets individuals and legal entities that wish to contact production plants in China to move their own production to China using the facilities of Chinese production plants or to search for the best price and quality based on existing offers in the Chinese market. We target any client categories but mostly small and mid-sized businesses that wish to purchase products in bulk in China and sell them in the territory of any country. 
 We project that our services will be interesting to the clients worldwide because many companies are interested in commercial and industrial relations with China due to the low cost of finished-product production.
 
Competition
 Currently, the market of consulting services in China is quite actively developed. Presently, there are many companies that render similar services. Due to its economic growth, China, as of today, becomes a more attractive platform for business. In order to take up a more beneficial position on this market, we offer to organize a complex service approach, that is, to offer a menu of service packages from which the client could choose the best one. Moreover, we see an advantage in working remotely with the client, and for that purpose, we plan to maximize our online tools.

 At present, we have no employees other than our officers and directors.  We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future.
