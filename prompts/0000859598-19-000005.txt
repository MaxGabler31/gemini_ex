In 2018, no single customer of Ocean Services accounted for 10% or more of consolidated operating revenues. The ten largest customers of Ocean Services accounted for approximately 65% of its operating revenues in 2018. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on Ocean Services’ results of operations.
Under a time charter, Ocean Services provides a vessel to a customer and is responsible for all operating expenses, typically excluding fuel and port charges. Under a bareboat charter, Ocean Services provides a vessel to a customer and the customer assumes responsibility for all operating expenses and risks of operation. Vessel charters may range from several days to several years. Contracts of affreightment are contracts for cargoes that are committed on a multi-voyage basis for various periods of time, with minimum and maximum cargo tonnages specified over the period at a fixed or variable rate per ton. Voyage charters are contracts to carry cargoes on a single voyage basis regardless of time to complete. Tariff and unit freight are typically contracted in accordance with a publicly available or contracted tariff rate or based on a negotiated rate when moving larger volumes over an extended period.
Competitive Conditions
Each of the markets in which Ocean Services operates is highly competitive including the U.S. “Jones Act” coastwise market, even though participation in the trade is not open to foreign-based competition. The most important competitive factors are pricing, vessel age, vessel type and vessel availability to fit customer requirements and delivery schedules.
Bulk Transportation. The primary direct competitors for Jones Act petroleum and chemical transportation services are other operators of Jones Act petroleum and chemical carriers, operators of refined product and crude pipelines, railroads and foreign-flag vessels delivering foreign sourced petroleum and chemicals to U.S. ports.

Bulk Transportation Services
Inland river barges are unmanned and are moved by towboats. The combination of a towboat and barges is commonly referred to as a “tow.”
Inland Services’ dry-cargo barge fleet consists of hopper barges, which are (i) covered for the transport of products such as grain and grain by-products, fertilizer, steel and frac sand or (ii) “open tops” primarily used for the transport of commodities that are not sensitive to water such as coal, aggregate scrap and containers. Each dry-cargo barge in the Inland Services’ fleet is capable of transporting approximately 1,500 to 2,200 tons (1,350 to 2,000 metric tons) of cargo depending on water depth (draft), river conditions and hull depth of the barge. Adverse river conditions, such as high water resulting from excessive rainfall or low water caused by drought, can impact operations by limiting the speed at which tows travel, the number of barges included in tows and the quantity of cargo that is loaded in the barges.
A typical dry-cargo grain voyage begins by shifting a clean, empty barge from a fleeting location to a loading facility. The barge is then moved from the loading location and assembled into a tow before proceeding to its discharge destination. After unloading, it is shifted to a fleeting area for cleaning, and service if needed, and then placed again in a tow to move to a load facility. In some instances after discharge of grain, barges pick up cargo and move it north to the grain originating areas of the river system instead of moving empty.
Inland Services’ fleet of inland river liquid tank barges transports primarily petroleum products on long-term voyage affreightment contracts on the Magdalena River in Colombia.
Inland Services’ joint ventures that provide bulk transportation services include: SCF Bunge Marine LLC, which operates towboats on the U.S. Inland Waterways; and SCFCo Holdings LLC (“SCFCo”), which transports various agricultural and industrial commodities on the Parana-Paraguay River Waterways in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay.
Port & Infrastructure Services
Terminals. Inland Services owns and operates high speed multi-modal terminal facilities located along the Mississippi River in the St. Louis harbor providing loading/unloading, transshipment, warehousing and drayage services. These terminals handle grain, grain by-products, fertilizer, steel, ethanol and other products for a multitude of customers. In addition, Inland Services owns a 50% noncontrolling interest in grain terminals/elevators in the Midwest and/or along the U.S. Inland Waterways.
In general, Inland Services operates these terminals by first unloading product that arrives by railcar or truck. The product is then loaded onto dry-cargo barges along with similar products. This process may also operate in reverse, with Inland Services unloading dry-cargo barges into trucks or railcars. A typical 15 dry-cargo barge tow, assuming no loading restrictions as a result of river conditions, can hold the equivalent of approximately 1,050 trucks or 216 railcars. As described above, a “tow” may consist of 15-40 barges and can take from several hours to several days to load and assemble.
Fleeting. Inland Services owns and/or operates a series of fleeting locations and harbor towboats from Davenport, Iowa through Memphis, Tennessee.  Inland Services’ fleeting services include: fleeting barges, port services, minor repairs, barge cleaning and line haul boat assists.
Fleeting locations are locations where barges may be parked prior to being loaded, unloaded, cleaned, repaired or stored until needed for future use. Typically, fleeting locations are in close proximity to terminals. Fleeting services generally include disassembling a tow by moving dry-cargo barges into the fleet, moving barges from the fleet to a terminal for loading or unloading, cleaning and repairing barges, if needed, and then reassembling the barges into a tow for future operations.
Logistics Services
SEACOR America’s Marine Highway (“AMH”).  Inland Services uses dry-cargo barges to move containers on the Mississippi River from Memphis, Tennessee to New Orleans, Louisiana. On this route, AMH transports empty containers in dry-cargo barges from Memphis to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The containers are then trucked (drayed) to customers in Baton Rouge for loading. Loaded containers are then transported in dry-cargo barges from Baton Rouge to New Orleans, primarily for export. AMH also provides drayage services in Freeport, Texas for resin customers.
Managed Services
Inland Services provides management services related to barge and towboat operations.

U.S. Inland Waterways. Inland Services transports various commodities on the U.S. Inland Waterways in dry-cargo barges, primarily grain and grain by-products, fertilizer, steel products, containers and other dry bulk commodities. Grain cargoes primarily move south and originate in the major grain producing areas of the U.S. Industrial cargo such as steel products including steel coils, fertilizer and general cargo typically move north. Generally, Inland Services attempts to coordinate the logistical match-up of northbound and southbound movements of cargo to minimize repositioning costs and optimize barge usage. In addition to its barge and towboat activities, Inland Services owns and operates high-speed multi-modal terminal facilities for both dry and liquid commodities and barge fleeting locations in various areas of the Inland Waterway System.
Magdalena River. Inland Services primarily transports petroleum products outbound from central Colombia to the Caribbean Sea for export or distribution.
Parana-Paraguay Waterway. Inland Services, through its 50% noncontrolling interest in SCFCo, transports various commodities on the Parana-Paraguay Waterway in dry-cargo barges, primarily grains, iron ore, and other bulk commodities. In addition to its primary barge and towboat business, SCFCo controls a transshipment terminal at the Port of Ibicuy, Argentina.
Seasonality
The volume of grain transported from the major grain producing areas of the U.S. for export through the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, is greatest during the harvest season from mid-August through late November. The harvest season is particularly significant to Inland Services because pricing for hauling freight tends to peak during these months in response to higher demand for transportation equipment. The severity of winter weather can also impact operations and contribute to volatility in revenues and expenses. Harsh winters typically force the upper Mississippi River to close and restrict barge traffic from mid-December to mid-March. Ice can also hinder the navigation of barge traffic on the mid-Mississippi River, the Illinois River, and the upper reaches of the Ohio River.
9

The Magdalena River basin has two rainy and two dry seasons annually. The lowest river levels occur from mid-December to mid-February, which can cause difficult navigational conditions within the mid and upper river regions and potentially reduce utilization of Inland Services’ barges in this region during that period.
On the Parana-Paraguay Waterway, water levels are typically lower during December and January, which can make navigation difficult on the northern portion of the river. During this time period, barge traffic is primarily focused on transporting grains from Paraguay to Argentina.
Customers and Contractual Arrangements
Bulk Transportation Services. The principal customers for Inland Services’ bulk transportation services are major grain exporters, farm cooperatives, importers and distributors of industrial materials, agricultural companies, fertilizer companies, trading companies, oil companies and industrial companies. Inland Services’ pooled dry-cargo barges are typically employed on a voyage basis at agreed rates for tons moved and with users having specified days for loading and discharging the cargo. In the trade, this is referred to as a contract of affreightment. If the user exceeds the specified number of days for loading and discharging the barges, the user pays demurrage (revenue to compensate for using the assets longer than allowed by contract). For longer term contracts of affreightment, base rates may be adjusted in response to changes in fuel prices and other operating expenses. Some term contracts provide for the transport of a minimum number of tons of cargo or specific transportation requirements for a particular customer. In the past, Inland Services has leased out barges (“bareboat chartered”) to competitors or cargo owners with all expenses being the responsibility of the lessee. Such leases were at a fixed rate per day and the duration varied from short periods necessary for the lessee to perform a single voyage to multi-year charters. Inland Services’ inland river liquid tank barges and specialty barges are operated under term contracts ranging from one to five years.
Port & Infrastructure Services. The principal customers for Inland Services’ port and infrastructure services are similar to those of bulk transportation services. Inland Services’ multi-modal terminals are marketed under contractual rates and terms driven by throughput volume. Inland Services' fleeting operations charge a day rate for holding barges in fleeting areas. Harbor boats, typically 800-1,550 HP, pick up and drop barges and assist in assembling tows that are moving up and down the river on line haul towboats, typically 3,800-10,000 HP. The service is provided for an agreed upon hourly charge. The harbor boats also perform shifting services, which include moving barges to and from the dock for loading and unloading. Typically, shifting is priced based on a fee per move. Inland Services’ fleeting operations also include cleaning, minor repairs on barges and line haul boat assists. Inland Services’ machine shop and shipyard repairs and upgrades towboats, repairs barges and other equipment and provides fabrication and dock repairs which are charged either on an hourly basis or a fixed fee basis depending on the scope and nature of work.
Logistics Services. The principal customers for Inland Services logistics services are shippers of raw materials, bulk and finished products that are shipped via container on barge. Over-the-road shipping costs, pollution and congestion of roadways are reduced by consolidating multiple container shipments onto a single barge for shipment. Inland Services also provides local drayage services. Inland Services’ logistics services are primarily marketed under contracted rates.
Managed Services. The principal customers for Inland Services managed services are typically third-party asset owners.
In 2018, no single customer of Inland Services accounted for 10% or more of consolidated operating revenues. The ten largest customers of Inland Services accounted for approximately 61% of its operating revenues in 2018. The loss of one or more of its customers could have a material adverse effect on Inland Services’ results of operations.
Competitive Conditions
Bulk Transportation Services. Inland Services’ bulk transportation services main direct competitors are other barge lines. Inland Services believes that 78% of the domestic dry-cargo hopper barge fleet is controlled by five companies. Railroads also compete for traffic that might otherwise move on the U.S. Inland Waterways.
Barriers to entry include complexity of operations, the difficulty of accumulating a sufficiently large asset base to cycle equipment efficiently, the challenge of hiring qualified personnel to oversee the complex logistics of exchanging equipment between fleets and long haul tows and executing timely placement for loading and discharging. Inland Services benefits from not only these factors, but also from long-term arrangements with key customers and SCF’s reputation for service.
Inland Services believes the primary barriers to effective competitive entry into the Magdalena River and Parana-Paraguay Waterways markets are similar to those that make it difficult to start new operations in the U.S. In addition, there are local flag requirements for equipment and local content requirements for operation. The primary competitive factors among established operators are price, availability, reliability and suitability of equipment for the various cargoes moved.
Port & Infrastructure Services. The primary direct competitors for Inland Services’ port and infrastructure services are other terminal and fleet operators. Location and access to inland waterways, rail and roads are Inland Service’s primary competitive advantages over other service providers.
10

Logistics Services. The primary competitors of Inland Services’ logistic services are trucking companies and other logistics companies that transport shipping containers and provide drayage services. Location of facilities, road access and the proximity to the inland waterways are Inland Services’ primary competitive advantages over other logistics providers.
Managed Services. The primary competitors for Inland Services’ managed services are other third party barge owners or managers.

Government Regulation
The Company’s ownership, operation, construction and staffing of vessels is subject to significant regulation under various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations, including international conventions and ship registry laws of the nations under which the Company’s vessels are flagged.
Regulatory Matters
Domestically registered vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard (“USCG”), the National Transportation Safety Board (“NTSB”), the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the U.S. Maritime Administration, as well as in certain instances, applicable state and local laws. These agencies establish safety requirements and standards and are authorized to investigate vessels and accidents and to recommend improved maritime safety standards.
Ocean Services and Inland Services are subject to regulation under the Jones Act and related U.S. cabotage laws, which restrict ownership and operation of vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade (i.e., trade between points in the United States), including the transportation of cargo. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be built in the United States, registered under the U.S.-flag, manned by predominantly U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. Violation of the Jones Act could prohibit operation of vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade during the period of such non-compliance, result in material fines and subject the Company’s vessels to seizure and forfeiture. For information on certain stock ownership limitations designed to facilitate our compliance with the Jones Act, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report.
Ocean Services and Inland Services operate vessels that are registered both in the United States and in a number of foreign jurisdictions. Vessels are subject to the laws of the applicable jurisdiction as to ownership, registration, manning, environmental protection and safety. In addition, the Company’s vessels are subject to the requirements of a number of international conventions that are applicable to vessels depending on their jurisdiction of registration. Among the more significant of these conventions are: (i) the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (“MARPOL”); (ii) the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 and 1978 Protocols (“SOLAS”); and (iii) the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (“STCW”).
The Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (the “MLC”) establishes comprehensive minimum requirements for working conditions of seafarers including, among other things, conditions of employment, hours of work and rest, grievance and complaints procedures, accommodations, recreational facilities, food and catering, health protection, medical care, welfare, and social security protection. The MLC defines seafarer to include all persons engaged in work on a vessel in addition to the vessel’s crew. Under this MLC definition, the Company may be responsible for proving that customer and contractor personnel aboard its vessels have contracts of employment that comply with the MLC requirements. The Company could also be responsible for salaries and/or benefits of third parties that may board one of the Company’s vessels. The MLC requires certain vessels that engage in international trade to maintain a valid Maritime Labour Certificate issued by their flag administration. Although the United States is not a party to the MLC, U.S.-flag vessels operating internationally must comply with the MLC when calling on a port in a country that is a party to the MLC. The Company has developed and implemented a fleetwide action plan to comply with the MLC to the extent applicable to its vessels.
The hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by an international classification society authorized by its country of registry, as well as being subject to survey and inspection by shipping regulatory bodies. The international classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and SOLAS. All of Ocean Services’ vessels are subject to the periodic inspection, survey, dry-docking and maintenance requirements of the USCG and/or the American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”) and other marine classification societies.
Under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, the Company’s U.S.-flagged vessels are subject to requisitioning by the U.S. Government under certain terms and conditions during a national emergency, as described further under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its vessels. The Company’s failure to maintain these authorizations could adversely impact its operations.
In addition to the USCG, the EPA, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Office of Pipeline Safety, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, and certain individual states regulate vessels (and other structures) in accordance with the requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) or under analogous state law. There is currently little uniformity among the regulations issued by these agencies, which increases the Company’s compliance costs and risk of non-compliance.
12

Although the Company faces some risk when managing responses to third-party oil spills, a responder engaged in emergency and crisis activities has immunity from liability under federal law and all U.S. coastal state laws for any spills arising from its response efforts, except in the event of death or personal injury or as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company may also have derivative immunity when working under the orders of authorized federal officials.
Environmental Compliance
The Company is subject to federal, state, local and international environmental and safety laws, regulations and conventions, including those related to the discharge of oil and pollutants into waters regulated thereunder. Violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions or other sanctions.
The Company does not expect that it will be required to make capital expenditures in the near future that would be material to its financial position or operations to comply with environmental laws and regulations; however, because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly strict requirements, the Company cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these laws and regulations.
OPA 90 establishes a regulatory and liability regime for the protection of the environment from oil spills. OPA 90 applies to owners and operators of facilities operating near navigable waters of the United States and owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels operating in U.S. waters, which include the navigable waters of the United States and the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”) around the United States. For purposes of its liability limits and financial responsibility, and response planning requirements, OPA 90 differentiates between tank vessels (such as the Company’s petroleum and chemical carriers and liquid tank barges) and “other vessels” (such as the Company’s tugs and dry-cargo barges).
Under OPA 90, owners and operators of regulated facilities and owners and operators or bareboat charterers of vessels are “responsible parties” and may be jointly, severally and strictly liable for removal costs and damages arising from facility and vessel oil spills or threatened spills up to certain limits of liability as discussed further below. Damages are defined broadly to include: (i) injury to natural resources and the costs of remediation thereof; (ii) injury to, or economic losses resulting from the destruction of, real and personal property; (iii) net loss by various governmental bodies of taxes, royalties, rents, fees and profits; (iv) lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to property or natural resources damage; (v) net costs of providing increased or additional public services necessitated by a spill response, such as protection from fire or other hazards or taking additional safety precautions; and (vi) loss of subsistence use of available natural resources.
OPA 90 limits liability for responsible parties for nontank vessels to the greater of $1,100 per gross ton or $939,800 and for tank vessels to the greater of $3,500 per gross ton or $25,845,600. These liability limits do not apply (a) if an incident is caused by the responsible party’s violation of federal safety, construction or operating regulations or by the responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, (b) if the responsible party fails to report the incident or to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection with oil removal activities as required by a responsible official or (c) if the responsible party fails to comply with an order issued under OPA 90.
The OPA 90 regulations also implement the financial responsibility requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which imposes liability for discharges of hazardous substances, similar to OPA 90, and provides compensation for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages. Liability per vessel under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5 million, unless the incident is caused by gross negligence, willful misconduct, or a violation of certain regulations, in which case liability is unlimited.
Under the Nontank Vessel Response Plan Final Rule, owners and operators of nontank vessels are required to prepare Nontank Vessel Response Plans. The Company expects its pollution liability insurance to cover spill removal costs, subject to coverage deductibles and limitations, including a cap of $1.0 billion. The Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if it incurs spill liability under circumstances in which the insurance carrier fails or refuses to provide coverage or the loss exceeds the Company’s coverage limitations.
MARPOL is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by vessels from operational or accidental discharges. It is implemented in the United States pursuant to the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships.
Since the 1990s, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has been aggressively enforcing U.S. criminal laws against vessel owners, operators, managers, crewmembers, shoreside personnel and corporate officers related to violations of MARPOL. Violations have frequently related to pollution prevention devices, such as the oily-water separator, and include falsifying records, obstructing justice, and making false statements. In certain cases, responsible shipboard officers and shoreside officials have been sentenced to prison. In addition, the DOJ has required most defendants to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance plan (“ECP”) or risk losing the ability to trade in U.S. waters. If the Company is subjected to a DOJ prosecution, it could suffer significant adverse effects, including substantial criminal penalties and defense costs, reputational damages and costs associated with the implementation of an ECP.
13

The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) prohibits the discharge of “pollutants” into the navigable waters of the United States. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances into navigable waters of the United States and the EEZ around the United States and imposes civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges, thereby creating exposures in addition to those arising under OPA 90 and CERCLA.
The CWA also established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permitting program, which governs discharges of pollutants into navigable waters of the United States. Pursuant to the NPDES program, the EPA has issued Vessel General Permits covering discharges incidental to normal vessel operations. The EPA issued the 2013 Vessel General Permit (“2013 VGP”) in early 2013 with an effective five-year period of December 19, 2013 to December 18, 2018. In light of the recent legislation described below, the 2013 VGP continues to apply to U.S.-flag and foreign-flag commercial vessels that are at least 79 feet in length and operate within the three-mile territorial sea of the United States. The 2013 VGP requires vessel owners and operators to adhere to “best management practices” to manage the covered discharges that occur normally in the operation of a vessel, including ballast water, and implements various training, inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, as well as corrective actions upon identification of deficiencies. The Company has filed a Notice of Intent to be covered by the 2013 VGP for each of the Company's ships that operate in U.S. waters.
In late 2018, the U.S. Congress passed the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”), which establishes a new framework for the regulation of vessel incident discharges. VIDA requires the EPA to develop performance standards for those discharges within two years of enactment and requires the USCG to develop implementation, compliance, and enforcement regulations within two years of the EPA’s promulgation of standards. VIDA extends the 2013 VGP’s provisions, leaving them in effect until new regulations are final and enforceable. Non-military, non-recreational vessels greater than 79 feet in length must continue to comply with the requirements of the 2013 VGP, including submission of annual reports. The Company can provide no assurance when the new regulations and performance standards will be issued, nor can it predict what additional costs it may incur to comply with any such new regulations and performance standards.
Many countries have ratified and are thus subject to the liability scheme adopted by the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) and set out in the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969 (the “1969 Convention”). Some of these countries have also adopted the 1992 Protocol to the 1969 Convention (the “1992 Protocol”). Under both the 1969 Convention and the 1992 Protocol, a vessel’s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil from ships carrying oil in bulk as cargo, subject to certain complete defenses. These conventions also limit the liability of the shipowner under certain circumstances, provided the discharge was not caused by the shipowner’s actual fault or intentional or reckless misconduct.
Vessels trading to countries that are parties to these conventions must provide evidence of insurance covering the liability of the owner. The Company believes that its Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) insurance will cover any liability under these conventions, subject to applicable policy deductibles, exclusions and limitations.
The United States is not a party to the 1969 Convention or the 1992 Protocol, and thus OPA 90, CERCLA, CWA and other federal and state laws apply in the United States as discussed above. In other jurisdictions where the 1969 Convention has not been adopted, various legislative and regulatory schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to that convention.
The International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, 2001 was adopted to ensure that adequate, prompt and effective compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by spills of oil when used as fuel by vessels. The convention applies to damage caused to the territory, including the territorial sea, and in the EEZs, of the countries that are party to it. Although the United States has not ratified this convention, U.S.-flag vessels operating internationally would be subject to it if they sail within the territories of those countries that have implemented its provisions. The Company believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
The National Invasive Species Act (“NISA”) was enacted in the United States in 1996 in response to growing reports of harmful organisms being released into United States waters through ballast water taken on by vessels in foreign ports. The USCG adopted regulations under NISA that impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering U.S. waters. All new vessels constructed on or after December 1, 2013, regardless of ballast water capacity, must comply with these requirements on delivery from the shipyard absent an extension from the USCG. Existing vessels with a ballast water capacity between 1,500 and 5,000 cubic meters must comply by their first scheduled dry-docking after January 1, 2014 or obtain a USCG extension. For non-exempt vessels, ballast water treatment equipment may be required to be utilized on the vessel. The Company believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
Some U.S. states have enacted legislation or regulations to address invasive species through ballast water and hull cleaning management and permitting requirements, which in many cases have also become part of the state’s 2013 VGP certification. Other states may proceed with the enactment of similar requirements that could increase the Company’s costs of operating in state waters.
14

In addition, the IMO ratified the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water Sediments on September 8, 2016, otherwise known as the Ballast Water Management Convention (the “BWM Convention”). The Company’s vessels that operate internationally will have to become compliant with international ballast water management regulations by their first renewal survey of the International Oil Pollution Prevention (“IOPP”) Certificate issued under MARPOL after September 8, 2017. Because the United States is not a party to the BWM Convention, those vessels may have to install an IMO approved ballast water management system (“BWMS”) or use one of the other management options under the BWM Convention. The Company believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
The U.S. Endangered Species Act, related regulations and comparable state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction. Protection may include restrictions on the speed of vessels in certain ocean waters and may require the Company to change the routes of the Company’s vessels during particular periods. For example, in an effort to prevent the collision of vessels with the North Atlantic right whale, federal regulations restrict the speed of vessels to ten knots or less in certain areas along the Atlantic Coast of the United States during certain times of the year. The reduced speed and special routing along the Atlantic Coast may result in the use of additional fuel, which could affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The Clean Air Act (as amended, the “CAA”) requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. The CAA also requires states to submit State Implementation Plans (“SIPs”), which are designed to attain national health-based air quality standards throughout the United States, including major metropolitan and/or industrial areas. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. The EPA and some states have each proposed more stringent regulations of air emissions from propulsion and auxiliary engines on oceangoing vessels.
MARPOL also addresses air emissions, including emissions of sulfur and nitrous oxide (“NOx”), from vessels, including a requirement to use low sulfur fuels worldwide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on vessels. Vessels worldwide are currently required to use fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 3.5%, which the IMO decided in October 2016 to reduce to 0.5% beginning in January 2020. As a result of this reduction, fuel costs for vessel operators could rise dramatically beginning in 2020, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability or its results of operations. MARPOL also imposes NOx emissions standards on installed marine diesel engines of over 130 kW output power other than those used solely for emergency purposes irrespective of the tonnage of the vessel into which such an engine is installed. The actual NOx limit is determined by a variety of factors, including the vessel’s construction date, the rated speed of the vessel’s engine, and the area in which the vessel is operating.
More stringent sulfur and NOx requirements apply in certain designated Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”). There are currently four ECAs worldwide: the Baltic Sea ECA, North Sea ECA, North American ECA and U.S. Caribbean ECA. As of January 1, 2015, vessels operating in an ECA must burn fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 0.1%. Further, marine diesel engines on vessels constructed on or after January 1, 2016 that are operated in an ECA must meet the stringent NOx standards described above.
The Company’s operations occasionally generate and require the transportation, treatment and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes that are subject in the United States to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) or comparable state, local or foreign requirements. From time to time, the Company arranges for the disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances at offsite disposal facilities. The EPA has a longstanding policy that RCRA only applies after wastes are “purposely removed” from a vessel. As a general matter, with certain exceptions, vessel owners and operators are required to determine if their wastes are hazardous, obtain a generator identification number, comply with certain standards for the proper management of hazardous wastes, and use hazardous waste manifests for shipments to disposal facilities. Moreover, vessel owners and operators may be subject to more stringent state hazardous waste requirements. If such materials are improperly disposed of by third parties with which the Company contracts, the Company may still be held liable for cleanup costs under applicable laws.
MARPOL also governs the discharge of garbage from ships. MARPOL defines certain sea areas, such as the “Wider Caribbean region,” requiring a higher level of protection than other areas of the sea.
Applicable MARPOL regulations provide for strict garbage management procedures and documentation requirements for all vessels and fixed and floating platforms. These regulations impose a general prohibition on the discharge of all garbage unless the discharge is expressly provided for under the regulations. The regulations have greatly reduced the amount of garbage that vessels are allowed to dispose of at sea and have increased the Company’s costs of disposing garbage remaining on board vessels at their port calls.
Various international conventions and federal, state and local laws and regulations have been considered or implemented to address the environmental effects of emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The U.S. Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases. At United Nations climate change conferences over the past few decades, various countries have agreed to specific international accords or protocols to establish 
15

limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. In December 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted pursuant to which member parties agreed to implement national programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, various countries adopted the Paris Agreement, which seeks to reduce emissions in an effort to slow global warming. The United States signed the Paris Agreement in 2016, but has subsequently taken steps to withdraw from the agreement. The Paris Agreement does not specifically mention shipping.
The IMO has announced its intention to develop limits on greenhouse gases from international shipping and is working on proposed mandatory technical and operational measures to achieve these limits. The first step toward this goal occurred in October 2016, when the IMO adopted a system for collecting data on ships’ fuel-oil consumption, which will be mandatory and apply globally.
Member states of the European Union are required to take steps to ensure that ships operating in the Baltic, the North Sea and the English Channel are using fuels with a sulfur content of no more than 0.1%. In addition, the European Parliament and E.U. Council have adopted a series of regulations that establish a system for monitoring, reporting and verifying emissions from vessels of 5,000 or more gross tons calling at E.U. ports.
In the United States, pursuant to an April 2007 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, the EPA was required to consider whether carbon dioxide should be considered a pollutant that endangers public health and welfare, and thus subject to regulation under the CAA. In October 2007, the California Attorney General and a coalition of environmental groups petitioned the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from oceangoing vessels under the CAA. On December 1, 2009, the EPA issued an “endangerment finding” regarding greenhouse gases under the CAA. To date, the regulations proposed and enacted by the EPA regarding carbon dioxide have not specifically involved oceangoing vessels. Under MARPOL, vessels operating in designated ECAs are required to meet fuel sulfur limits and NOx emission limits, including the use of engines that meet the EPA standards for NOx emissions as discussed above.
Any future adoption of climate control treaties, legislation or other regulatory measures by the United Nations, IMO, United States or other countries where the Company operates that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could result in financial and operational impacts on the Company’s business (including potential capital expenditures to reduce such emissions) that the Company cannot predict with certainty at this time. In addition, there may be significant physical effects of climate change from such emissions that have the potential to negatively impact the Company’s customers, personnel, and physical assets any of which could adversely impact cargo levels, the demand for Company’s services or the Company’s ability to recruit personnel.
The Company seeks to manage exposure to losses from the above-described laws through its development of appropriate risk management programs, including compliance programs, safety management systems and insurance programs. Although the Company believes these programs mitigate its legal risk, there can be no assurance that any future regulations or requirements or any discharge or emission of pollutants by the Company will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Security
In recent years, the USCG, the IMO, states and local ports have adopted heightened security procedures relating to ports and vessels.
Specifically, on November 25, 2002, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) was signed into law. To implement certain portions of MTSA, in July 2003, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Similarly, in December 2002, the IMO adopted amendments to SOLAS, known as the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (the “ISPS Code”), creating a new chapter dealing specifically with maritime security. The chapter imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities. Among the various requirements under MTSA and/or the ISPS Code are:

• | onboard installation of automatic information systems to enhance vessel-to-vessel and vessel-to-shore communications;


• | onboard installation of ship security alert systems;


• | the development of vessel and facility security plans;


• | the implementation of a Transportation Worker Identification Credential program; and


• | compliance with flag state security certification requirements.

The USCG regulations, which are intended to align with international maritime security standards, generally deem foreign-flag vessels to be in compliance with MTSA vessel security measures provided such vessels have onboard a valid International Ship Security Certificate that attests to the vessel’s compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code. However, U.S.-flag vessels that are engaged in international trade must comply with all of the security measures required by MTSA, as well as SOLAS and the ISPS Code.

In response to these new security programs and applicable regulations, the Company has implemented security plans and procedures for each of its U.S.-flag vessels, its terminal operation in Sauget, Illinois and its Port Dania facility in Dania Beach, Florida.
The International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), adopted by the IMO as an amendment to SOLAS, provides international standards for the safe management and operation of ships and for the prevention of marine pollution from ships. The United States enforces the ISM Code for all U.S.-flag vessels and those foreign-flag vessels that call at U.S. ports. All of the Company’s vessels that are 500 or more gross tons are required to be certified under the standards set forth in the ISM Code’s safety and pollution protocols. The Company also voluntarily complies with these protocols for some vessels that are under the mandatory 500 gross ton threshold. Under the ISM Code, vessel operators are required to develop an extensive safety management system (“SMS”) that includes, among other things, the adoption of a written system of safety and environmental protection policies setting forth instructions and procedures for operating their vessels subject to the ISM Code, and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. The Company has developed such a safety management system. These SMS policies apply to both the vessel and shore-side personnel and are vessel specific. The ISM Code also requires a Document of Compliance (“DOC”) to be obtained for the vessel manager and a Safety Management Certificate (“SMC”) to be obtained for each vessel subject to the ISM Code that it operates or manages. The Company has obtained DOCs for its shore-side offices that have responsibility for vessel management and SMCs for each of the vessels that such offices operate or manage.
Noncompliance with the ISM Code and other IMO regulations may subject the shipowner or charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. For example, the USCG authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code will be prohibited from trading to United States ports.
Industry Hazards and Insurance
Vessel operations involve inherent risks associated with carrying large volumes of cargo and rendering services in a marine environment. Hazards include adverse weather conditions, collisions, fire and mechanical failures, which may result in death or injury to personnel, damage to equipment, loss of operating revenues, contamination of cargo, pollution and other environmental damages and increased costs. The Company maintains hull, liability and war risk, general liability, workers compensation and other insurance customary in the industries in which the Company operates. The Company believes it will be able to renew any expiring policy without causing a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company also conducts training and safety programs to promote a safe working environment and minimize hazards.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed 2,518 individuals. In the United States, a total of 962 employees in Ocean Services and Inland Services are unionized under collective bargaining agreements that expire at varying times through July 31, 2022.
Management considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory.
