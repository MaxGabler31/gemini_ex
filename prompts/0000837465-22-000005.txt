Item 1.    Business Overview
Callaway Golf Company (the “Company,” “Callaway” or “Callaway Golf”) is a technology-enabled golf and active lifestyle leader with a portfolio of global brands, including Callaway Golf, Topgolf, Odyssey, OGIO, TravisMathew and Jack Wolfskin. The Company has evolved over time from a manufacturer of golf clubs to a modern golf, lifestyle and entertainment Company. In an effort to diversify and explore new growth opportunities, in 2017, the Company expanded its soft goods business to include premium lifestyle product lines, namely apparel, footwear, bags and accessories, that are complementary to golf with the acquisitions of OGIO and TravisMathew. In 2019, the Company acquired Jack Wolfskin, a premium outdoor apparel, footwear and equipment brand, which further enhanced the Company's lifestyle category and provided a platform in the active outdoor and urban outdoor categories. More recently, on March 8, 2021, the Company completed its merger with Topgolf, a leading technology-enabled golf entertainment business that offers an innovative platform comprised of state-of-the-art open-air golf and entertainment venues, in addition to proprietary ball-tracking technology under the Toptracer brand and an innovative media platform. Through these acquisitions and the recent merger with Topgolf, the Company transformed into a modern golf, lifestyle and entertainment company with a compelling family of brands that are sold in the United States and internationally in over 120 countries, and across multiple channels including wholesale, retail, on-line through its websites, and at Topgolf venues. Callaway was incorporated in California in 1982 and became a publicly traded corporation in 1992, and in 1999, reincorporated in the State of Delaware.
GROWTH AND OVERALL STRATEGY
In 2021, the golf and outdoor industries benefited from strong industry tailwinds and positive market trends, which the Company believes will continue to provide strong foundation for underlying growth for the business. The golf industry in particular is expanding through increased on-course and off-course golf participation, and also through increased participation in golf entertainment, all of which have contributed to an increased number of new players to the sport in recent years. Callaway believes its diversified portfolio, especially with its recent merger with Topgolf, combined with its clear growth strategy within each segment, will result in both short-term and long-term results that will outpace the industry average. 
Looking ahead, the Company may continue to explore additional opportunities for inorganic growth through strategic mergers and acquisitions that help strengthen the current lines of business and reinforce Callaway’s leadership position in the growing and evolving golf, outdoor and entertainment industries.
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND PRODUCTS
The Company manages its global business operations through its operating and reportable business segments. Due to its recent merger with Topgolf, the Company reassessed its operating segments and added a third operating segment for its Topgolf business. Therefore, as of December 31, 2021, the Company had three reportable operating business segments: Topgolf, Golf Equipment and Apparel, Gear and Other.
TOPGOLF
In March 2021, the Company completed its merger with Topgolf International, Inc. (“Topgolf”), in an all-stock transaction. Topgolf is a leading technology-enabled golf entertainment business with an innovative platform comprised of its state-of-the-art open-air golf and entertainment venues, revolutionary Toptracer ball-tracking technology and digital media platform. The venues business line is Topgolf’s largest business. Topgolf's other business lines include the Toptracer Range ball tracking technology and digital media.
Domestic and International Venues
The venues business is comprised of company-operated venue operations within the United States and Company-operated and franchised venues outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2021, Topgolf had 67 Company-operated venues in the United States, three Company-operated venues in the United Kingdom and three franchised venues in Australia, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. Over the next several years, the Company’s focus is to maintain a strong pipeline of new venue openings, both domestically and internationally through increasing the number of Company-operated venues, as well as through its franchise partners internationally. 
For certain risks associated with the opening of venues, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Sales
Revenue from venues are primarily derived from food and beverage, gameplay and events. Topgolf’s venue facilities offer multiple forms of entertainment and are equipped with technology-enabled hitting bays, multiple bars, dining areas and exclusive event spaces. Topgolf’s venues incorporate proprietary ball-tracking technologies to “gamify” golf and offer guests the chance to enjoy a variety of games developed to appeal to a broad range of players of different skills. Topgolf venues provide flexible spaces that are used for enjoying food and beverage, watching sports, charity fundraisers, corporate outings, golf instruction, playing games and watching live music. Topgolf rents spaces ranging in size from 12 to up to 1,000 attendees for events to individuals and organizations for a variety of different occasions, including corporate events and social gatherings. Topgolf also hosts events similar to arenas and other entertainment venues such as live concerts and team-building events. 
Competition
Topgolf venues compete for consumers’ time and discretionary entertainment dollars against a broad range of other out-of-home entertainment options including other dining and entertainment venues, sports activity centers, traditional driving ranges and other establishments offering simulated golf or multi-sport experiences, arcades and entertainment centers, movie theaters, sporting events, bowling alleys, nightclubs, bars and restaurants.
Design and Development
Topgolf tailors the design of its venues to thrive in varying climates, conditions and market sizes. The location of each of Topgolf’s venues is carefully selected through a disciplined, data-driven site selection process, led by an experienced real estate team and augmented by a nationwide broker network. A typical venue takes between 10 and 15 months to build, though build times vary based on the size and complexity of the model, existing site conditions, the season and other factors. Topgolf primarily uses the services of design/build contractors for the construction of its venues, and generally estimates the gross development cost to build a venue to be between $10 million and $55 million depending on the size and location of the facility. Topgolf typically seeks to finance the construction of its venues through third-party developers or real estate financing partners. While Topgolf is still required to fund a portion of venue development costs, its financing partner will purchase or lease the land and fund a majority of venue development costs during and after construction. Once construction is completed, Topgolf leases the venue and underlying land back from the financing partner, or in cases where Topgolf does not choose to finance venue construction through one of its financing partners, Topgolf will fund 100% of venue development costs.
Venue Management and Operations
The operations of domestic venues are supported by a multi-disciplined operations team. This team is responsible for a number of areas, including pre-opening activities (such as employee recruitment, selection and training), culinary development, event sales support, technology services, supply chain support for food, beverages and equipment, marketing, and ongoing training and development for associates. Maintaining a high degree of quality in the venues depends in part on Topgolf’s ability to acquire food and beverage ingredients, venue hardware, golf equipment and other supplies that meet Topgolf’s high standards from reliable suppliers. Topgolf uses a third-party verification company to ensure that all vendors meet United States guidelines and regulations, and for produce, it uses a third-party vendor that regulates a network of produce distributors nationwide. Topgolf has supply agreements in place with manufacturers in Taiwan and China to produce the radio-frequency identification ("RFID")-enabled golf equipment, which is specially designed for venue use. Bay equipment is custom-built for Topgolf, primarily by domestic manufacturers.
Advertising & Marketing
The venues play a lead role in connecting people in meaningful ways by introducing guests to the brand, culture and technologies. Topgolf places a large focus on its owned channels of communication to fuel a more personalized approach for attracting repeat visits through email and text messages to its large subscriber base. Venues are also promoted across various marketing channels, including content distributed through paid advertising networks, email and text message subscriber lists, Topgolf social media pages and online word-of-mouth or other media coverage.
Content Design and Development
The technology and game development for Topgolf is supported by teams located in offices and studios across Dallas, Texas, San Francisco, California and Stockholm, Sweden. These teams are comprised of front-end and back-end 
engineers including software, network, structural, radio frequency, electrical, mechanical, machine learning, visual recognition, system test, computer vision scientists and data analysis, user experience and industrial design engineers, and mobile app developers. Topgolf utilizes a number of proprietary, industry standard and third-party management information systems in its business and relies on its own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate games and to maintain and provide analytics data. 
For certain risks associated with content design and development, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Seasonality
Sales of the Topgolf business generally fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors. Historically, venues experience higher sales during the second and third quarters associated with the spring and summer seasons. Comparatively, Topgolf’s first and fourth quarters have historically seen lower sales at its venues during the cold-weather months of fall and winter. Seasonality is expected to be a factor in Topgolf's results of operations. As a result, factors affecting peak seasons at venues, such as adverse weather, could have a disproportionate effect on its operating results.
Other Lines of Business
Topgolf licenses Toptracer, its proprietary ball-tracking technology to independent driving ranges and for use in golf broadcasts. To date, Topgolf has installed over 15,000 Toptracer bays worldwide. Toptracer delivers a data-driven and "gamified" enhancement to the traditional driving range experience by delivering instant shot replays, gameplay for all skill levels and a data record of all shots. The Toptracer ball-tracking technology actively tracks all ball flight paths across an entire field of vision, and its custom-built sensor is able to provide real-time shot analytics, such as ball speed, apex, curve, carry and more. Topgolf sources the components used in the Toptracer business from a number of third-party suppliers located in Germany, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States, either directly or indirectly through distributors. Topgolf has developed a global distribution strategy for the Toptracer range business that utilizes a third-party logistics partner for warehousing and distribution, with warehouses currently located in the United States and the United Kingdom. To help build brand awareness, Topgolf primarily utilizes public relations, influencer marketing, professional athletes, social media, conferences, event marketing and paid media to support lead generation and sales efforts. Toptracer competes against other companies to attract and retain qualified licensees. The ability to attract new franchisees and licensees is based primarily on the strength and quality of the brand and reputation, the products and revenue opportunities Topgolf is able to provide, as well as on the structure of the operating models and the terms of the respective agreements. The Company anticipates expanding the global reach of its Toptracer range technology product by leveraging both the Toptracer and Callaway sales teams that have strong relationships with driving range owners around the world.
Topgolf’s digital media platform is primarily comprised of digital games such as the mobile golf game World Golf Tour (“WGT”), advertising partnerships (sponsorships) and other digital content creation. WGT is an online multiplayer virtual golf game that utilizes proprietary GPS and 3D technology to enable players to gather online as a community and experience simulated gameplay on photorealistic recreations of more than 15 world-famous golf courses. Advertising partnerships provide corporate sponsors the opportunity to feature their names and logos at Topgolf venues and on other media platforms. Digital gaming, corporate partnerships, and the digital content produced by Topgolf compete for consumers’ attention, leisure time and discretionary spending against the other home-based entertainment alternatives, particularly content focused on golf or other sports.
GOLF EQUIPMENT
The Company designs, manufactures and sells a full line of high-quality golf equipment, which is comprised of the golf clubs and golf balls product groups. The Company designs its golf products to be technologically advanced for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional, and are generally designed to conform to the Rules of Golf as published by the United States Golf Association ("USGA") and the ruling authority known as The R&A. 
Products
Golf clubs include woods (drivers, fairway woods and hybrids) and irons (irons, wedges and packaged sets) sold under the Callaway brand, and putters sold under the Odyssey brand, including Toulon Design by Odyssey. This product group also includes Callaway and non-Callaway pre-owned golf clubs. Callaway’s golf clubs are generally made of steel, titanium alloys, carbon fiber and various thermoplastic and thermoset materials.
Golf balls are sold under the Callaway Golf and Strata brands and are generally either a 2-piece golf ball (consisting of a core and cover) or a multilayer golf ball (consisting of two or more components in addition to the cover). The Company’s golf ball products include covers that incorporate a traditional dimple pattern as well as covers that incorporate innovative designs, including the Company’s proprietary HEX Aerodynamics (i.e., a lattice of tubes that form hexagons and pentagons), Hybrid Cover, Triple Track Technology and Truvis patterns. Callaway golf balls are generally made of various combinations of synthetic rubber, ionomer blends and urethane processed with other chemicals to optimize performance.
Product Design and Development
The Company is innovating to maintain its market share leadership position in both golf clubs and golf balls by investing in research and development and leveraging artificial intelligence in its product design process. The Company designs its golf equipment products to be technologically advanced and has not limited itself in its research efforts by trying to duplicate designs that are traditional or conventional. The Company has the ability to create and modify product designs by using computer aided design software, finite element analysis software and structural optimization techniques employing Artificial Intelligence methods. Further, the Company utilizes a variety of testing equipment and computer software, including golf robots, launch monitors, a proprietary virtual test center, a proprietary performance analysis system, an indoor test range and other methods to develop and test its golf equipment products. 
Manufacturing
The Company has its primary golf club assembly facility in Monterrey, Mexico, and maintains limited golf club assembly in its facilities in Carlsbad, California. In addition, used clubs that the Company receives from its Trade-In Trade-Up program are refurbished at its facility in Austin, Texas. The Company's golf clubs are also assembled in Tokyo, Japan; Swindon, England; Melbourne, Australia, and other local markets based on regional demand for custom clubs. In addition, the Company utilizes golf club contract manufacturers in China and Vietnam. In 2021 and 2020 and 2019, most of the Company’s golf club assembly volume was made in regions outside of the United States. Overall, the golf club assembly process is fairly labor intensive, requires extensive global supply chain coordination and utilizes raw materials that are obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States.
The Company has a golf ball manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts, and also utilizes golf ball contract manufacturers in Taiwan and China. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately 75%, 70% and 60%, respectively, of the Company's golf ball unit volume was manufactured in regions outside of the United States. The overall golf ball manufacturing process utilizes raw materials that are obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States.
Sales
The Company sells its golf equipment products in the United States and internationally, directly and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, to wholesale customers, including pro-shops at golf courses and off-course retailers, sporting goods retailers, on-line retailers, third-party distributors and certain products to mass merchants, as well as directly to consumers through its websites and retail locations in Japan. The Company offers custom club fitting programs at its performance centers and at participating on- and off- course retail stores to help consumers find a set of golf clubs to fit their personal specifications. In addition, the Company sells to corporate customers who want their corporate logo imprinted on certain of the Company’s golf equipment. 
The Company also sells certified pre-owned golf clubs directly to the consumer through its website. The Company generally acquires the pre-owned clubs through its Trade In! Trade Up! program, which gives golfers the opportunity to trade in their used Callaway golf clubs and certain competitor golf clubs at authorized retailers or through its website for credit toward the purchase of new golf equipment or pre-owned golf clubs.
Competition
For its golf equipment products, the Company generally competes on the basis of technology, quality, performance, customer service and price. In order to gauge the effectiveness of the Company’s response to such factors, management receives and evaluates Company-generated market trends for United States and foreign markets, as well as periodic public and customized market research for the United States and U.K. markets from Golf Datatech and The National Golf Foundation that include trends from certain on- and off-course retailers. In addition, the Company utilizes Growth from Knowledge Group for data and analysis on the consumer goods market in Japan.
The Company’s major competitors for drivers, fairway woods and irons are TaylorMade, Ping, Acushnet (Titleist brand), Puma (Cobra brand), SRI Sports Limited (Cleveland and Srixon brands), Mizuno, Bridgestone, and Parsons Xtreme Golf (PXG). For putters, the Company’s major competitors are Acushnet (Titleist & Scotty Cameron brands), Ping and TaylorMade. The Company believes that it is a technological leader in every golf club market in which it competes.
The Company’s major competitors for golf balls include Acushnet (Titleist and Pinnacle brands), SRI Sports Limited (Dunlop and Srixon brands), Bridgestone (Bridgestone and Precept brands), TaylorMade and others. These competitors compete for market share in the golf ball business, with Acushnet having a market share of over 50% of the golf ball business in the United States and a leading position in certain other regions outside the United States. The Company believes that it is a technological leader in the golf ball category. 
For certain risks associated with competition, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Advertising & Marketing
The Company’s marketing campaigns on its golf equipment products are aimed to increase consumer awareness of the products and support the overall growth strategy. The Company has focused its advertising efforts mainly on television commercials, primarily on The Golf Channel, and on network television during golf telecasts, web-based digital and social media advertising, printed advertisements in national magazines, such as Golf Magazine and Golf Digest, as well as in-store advertising. Additionally, the Company advertises its golf equipment to the Topgolf consumer who is part of the Topgolf community. The Company also establishes relationships with professional athletes and personalities, including members of various professional golf tours as well as other athletes and personalities, in order to promote the Company’s golf equipment product lines. 
For certain risks associated with such endorsements, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Seasonality
In most of the regions where the Company conducts business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis. Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company’s on-course customers closing for the cold weather months. The Company’s golf equipment business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations. In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its golf club and golf ball products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season. This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter. Second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter. Third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but can also include smaller new product launches, typically resulting in lower sales than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season. Fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company’s key regions. However, third-quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year product launch, and fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year. This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions. In general, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company’s sales from its Golf Equipment operating segment and most, if not all, of its profitability from this segment generally occurs during the first half of the year.

The Company designs, develops and sells high quality soft goods products under the Callaway, TravisMathew, OGIO and Jack Wolfskin brands.

For certain risks associated with product design and development, see below, “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Sales
The Company sells its soft goods products in the United States and internationally, directly and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, to wholesale customers and directly to consumers through its retail locations and on-line through its websites.
The Company sells its Callaway soft goods products to golf retailers (including pro-shops at golf courses and off-course retailers), sporting goods retailers, on-line retailers, and third party distributors, as well as directly to consumers through the Callaway Golf website and various retail, outlet and store-in-store locations in Japan, and most recently, in Korea.

Jack Wolfskin retail stores are located primarily in Europe, and in 2020, Jack Wolfskin opened its first North American online retail store, followed by the opening of its first United States showroom retail location in Park City, Utah in 2021.
Competition
The Company’s major competitors for its golf apparel and accessories are generally other golf companies and premium golf apparel companies, as well as specialty retailers. While the TravisMathew business faces competition from the premium golf apparel companies, it also competes in department stores with other men’s apparel companies, including Bonobos, johnnie-O, Nike, Peter Millar, Ted Baker London and Vince. With the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business, there are a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names with which the Company competes, including Patagonia, Columbia and The North Face. The Company seeks to differentiate itself through elevated design, premium materials and product innovation. For certain risks associated with competition, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Advertising & Marketing
The Company markets and advertises its soft goods brands on various platforms, including television, traditional digital and print media, web-based media and social media, experimental events and the Topgolf venues and media. The Company also establishes relationships with professional athletes and personalities, including members of various professional golf tours as well as other athletes and personalities, in order to promote the Company’s soft goods product lines. 
For certain risks associated with such endorsements, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Seasonality
Sales of the Callaway-branded golf apparel and accessories generally follow the same seasonality as golf equipment, and are therefore generally higher during the first half of the year. Sales of TravisMathew branded golf and lifestyle apparel and accessories are more evenly spread throughout the year as sales are more diversified due to an increase in direct-to-consumer sales resulting from the expansion of TravisMathew stores, which is expected to continue. Sales of outdoor apparel, footwear and equipment related to the Jack Wolfskin business focuses primarily on outerwear and consequently experiences stronger sales for such products during the cold-weather months and the corresponding prior sell-in periods. Therefore, sales of Jack Wolfskin products are generally greater during the second half of the year.
DISTRIBUTION
The Company has its primary distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas for the distribution of golf equipment products and soft goods products in North America, in addition to distribution centers in Toronto, Canada; Swindon, England; Melbourne, Australia; Hamburg, Germany; and Shanghai, China, and third-party logistical operations in Tokyo, Japan and Seoul, Korea to support the distribution needs of markets they serve.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
Employee Profile
Callaway views its employees as its most valuable asset and seeks to attract and maintain the highest quality talent by offering competitive benefits and wellness services, opportunities to grow professionally, and regular evaluations, among other initiatives. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 24,800 and 4,200 full-time and part-time employees, respectively. The increase in 2021 was due to the merger with Topgolf completed in March 2021, which resulted in the addition of 20,100 Topgolf Associates. The Company employs temporary manufacturing workers as needed based on labor demands that fluctuate with the Company's seasonality.
The Company’s golf ball manufacturing employees in Chicopee, Massachusetts are unionized and are covered under a collective bargaining agreement with International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers A.F.L.-C.I.O.

To achieve this, the Company promotes a variety of diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE&I") initiatives within the Company and throughout local communities. 
Callaway’s merger with Topgolf has strengthened the Company's efforts to promote DE&I throughout the Company. Topgolf strives to bring accessibility to the game of golf by creating an experience that is fun, social, and entertaining. It is part of Topgolf’s goal to break down barriers, promote inclusion, and invite diverse groups of people to enjoy the game of golf for the first time. Additionally, Topgolf has been awarded three different prestigious employer awards in recognition of its DE&I efforts, including the Diversity Jobs Top Employer 2021, Forbes 2020 Best Employers for Women, and National Down Syndrome Congress 2018 Employer of the Year.
Employee Well Being
The Company is committed to the health and well-being of its employees, and designs its compensation and benefits programs to demonstrate this commitment. For example, in addition to offering competitive compensation and a full suite of standard benefits, including comprehensive health, life and disability insurance coverage and a retirement plan with matching benefits, the Company offers its employees product discounts as well as the ability to participate in a variety of wellness programs which include fitness facilities, exercise programs, and a variety of educational resources which address various aspects of physical, mental, nutritional and financial health. The Company also offers benefit plan participants the opportunity to reduce employee health care costs through wellness incentives and provides an Employee Assistance program to all employees. 
In addition, the Company's commitment to its employees’ and customers’ health and safety continues to be paramount in its response to the evolving circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company undertook various safety measures which were outlined in the Safe Reopening Plans at each location and included implementing work from home measures, establishing social distancing guidelines, increasing cleaning protocols at sites, requiring face coverings to be worn at offices, venues and retail stores, as well as temperature or wellness checks upon entering certain of the Company's office locations and buildings. Additionally, the Company established a global COVID-19 core team (including senior leadership) to strategize about impacts to employees and customers, develop and implement comprehensive COVID-19 policies, procedures, and reopening plans in support of country, federal, state, and local guidelines, and train employees on site-specific protocols.

Community Giving
The Company also has three existing programs focusing on the community: the Callaway Golf Company Foundation (the "Foundation"), the Callaway Golf Company Employee Community Giving Program (the "Community Giving Program"), and the Topgolf Driving for Good Program. Through these programs, the Company and its employees are able to give back to the community through monetary donations and by providing community services. Through the Foundation, the Company strives to create healthy communities where its stakeholders live and work, by focusing on supporting programs that improve lives and contribute to communities on a select basis. In 2021, the Company contributed $1.0 million to the Foundation towards these programs. In April 2021, Callaway and the Foundation were chosen as the recipients of the 2021 Corporate Philanthropy Award by the San Diego-based North County Philanthropy Council. Through the Community Giving Program, Company employees and their family members volunteer with local non-profit organizations.

Callaway gives its global subsidiaries the ability to lead their own community engagement initiatives. To facilitate this, the Company provides the sales teams with product donation accounts to manage their contributions to charities and fundraiser events. Callaway also encourages global offices and subsidiaries to engage in community partnerships at their discretion.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
The Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements, including those related to, among others, nutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements, food safety regulations, employment regulations, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”), the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"), and similar state laws, privacy and cybersecurity laws, environmental, health and human safety laws and regulations, laws and regulations related to franchising and licensing operations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws, as well as federal, state and local licensing requirements and other regulations relating to alcoholic beverage control, amusement, health, sanitation, human safety, zoning and land use. New laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may also impact the business. 
Historically, the costs of regulation compliance have not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable Government Laws. Due to the nature of the Company’s operations and the frequently changing nature of compliance regulation, the Company cannot predict with certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable Government Regulation.
For certain risks associated with regulation compliance, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
By being active and visible in the community and by embracing the principles of environmental stewardship, the Company believes it is acting in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. In 2019, the Company, at the direction of its Chief Executive Officer with oversight from the Board of Directors, formally launched the Global Sustainability Program. The goal of this program is to bring increased awareness and structure to the Company’s existing social and environmental sustainability initiatives, while also enhancing the sustainability efforts across its global businesses. In connection with launching the Global Sustainability Program, the Company established an Executive Sustainability Committee comprising its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, all other executive officers, and the General Counsel. A Sustainability Core Team meets and then reports progress of the Global Sustainability Program quarterly to the Executive Sustainability Committee. Members of the Sustainability Core Team, known as Sustainability Champions, are employees who have been selected from throughout the organization to drive large-scale global projects that build upon the Company’s existing environmental and social sustainability efforts. Sustainability Champions also promote smaller-scale employee-driven initiatives at the local levels. These projects and initiatives are benchmarked against the sustainability frameworks published by the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board with respect to sustainability issues that are likely to affect the financial conditions or operating performances of companies in the consumer goods, apparel and entertainment sectors.
The Company’s entire Board of Directors oversee the Global Sustainability Program and receives a comprehensive report regarding the program’s initiatives and progress on an annual basis. Additionally, the General Counsel of the Company provides a quarterly update to the Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on the Company’s latest third-party performance scores on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) topics to maintain a consistent pulse on the Company’s ESG performance.
The Global Sustainability Program has played an integral role in assessing the Company’s material ESG concerns and developing the Company’s sustainability strategy, goals, and the inaugural Sustainability Report for the year ended December 31, 2021, which includes Topgolf within its scope. The Company intends to publish and make available this Sustainability Report on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website during the first half of 2022. The Global Sustainability Program has also introduced a variety of new initiatives across the Company, including: establishing a quarterly internal sustainability newsletter; enhancing sustainability content on the Company’s website; and engaging employees globally to devise new sustainability action plans for the Company’s various brands and workspaces.
Environmental Matters
The Company’s operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes and the remediation of environmental contaminants (collectively, “Environmental Laws”). In the ordinary course of its manufacturing processes, the Company uses paints, chemical solvents and other materials, and generates waste by-products that are subject to these Environmental Laws. In addition, in connection with the Company's Top-Flite asset acquisition in 2003, the Company assumed certain monitoring and remediation obligations at its manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts. In February 2013, the Company sold this facility and leased back a reduced portion of the square footage that it believes is adequate for its ongoing golf ball manufacturing operations. As part of the terms of this sale, the Company assumed certain ongoing environmental remediation obligations.
The Company endeavors to adhere to all applicable Environmental Laws and takes action as necessary to comply with these laws. The Company maintains an environmental and safety program and employs full-time environmental, health and safety professionals at its facilities located in Carlsbad, California, Chicopee, Massachusetts and Monterrey, Mexico. The environmental and safety program includes obtaining environmental permits as required, capturing and appropriately disposing of any waste by-products, tracking hazardous waste generation and disposal, air emissions, safety situations, material safety data sheet management, storm water management and recycling, and auditing and reporting on its compliance. The Company conducts third party social, safety and environmental responsibility audits to evaluate and improve its environmental performance through its global supply chain. The audits facilitate compliance with applicable Environmental Laws and good manufacturing practices within the global supply chain. Historically, the costs of environmental compliance have not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company believes that 
its operations, including Topgolf, are in substantial compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws. Due to the nature of the Company’s operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology, the Company cannot predict with certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable Environmental Laws. 
Social Matters
The Company maintains a Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy, which establish the foundation of its Corporate Social Responsibility ("CSR") Program that was established in 2007. In 2019, the Company updated its CSR audit policy and procedure, benchmarking against the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labor Organization Guidelines. The Company takes actions as necessary to ensure supplier compliance, and actively works with suppliers to improve performance through training, internal and third-party audits and corrective action plan validation. The Company employs a team to conduct and oversee corporate social responsibility audits globally and has not identified any material compliance issues with its suppliers to date. In addition to the CSR Program, the Company participates in environmental, social and product compliance working groups through the American Apparel and Footwear Association ("AAFA") and is a signatory to the Responsible Recruiting Commitment and Cambodia (Worker’s Rights) Brand Letter. Also, Jack Wolfskin’s engagement in the Fair Wear Foundation promotes social responsibility and transparency in the supply chain.
