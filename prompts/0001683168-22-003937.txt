Item 1. Business
Company Background
 
Mobiquity Technologies, Inc. is a next-generation marketing and advertising technology and data intelligence company which operates through our proprietary software platforms in the programmatic advertising space. Our product solutions are comprised of two proprietary software platforms:

· | Our advertising technology operating system (or ATOS) platform; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Our data intelligence platform. 

Our Products
 
The ATOS Platform
 
Our ATOS platform blends artificial intelligence (or AI) and machine learning (ML) based optimization technology for automatic ad serving that manages digital advertising inventory and campaigns. The ATOS platform:

· | creates an automated marketplace of advertisers and publishers on digital media outlets to host online auctions to facilitate the sale of digital advertising (known as digital real estate) targeted at users while engaged on their internet-connected TV, laptop, tablet, desktop computer, mobile, and over-the-top (or OTT) streaming media devices; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | gives advertisers the capability to understand and interact with their audiences and engage them in a meaningful way by using ads in both image and video formats (known as rich media) to increase their awareness, customer base and foot traffic to their e-commerce site, voting site or physical locations. 

 
Our ATOS platform engages with approximately 10 billion advertisement opportunities per day, based on our daily logs. Our sales and marketing strategy for our ATOS platform is focused on providing a de-fragmented operating system that facilitates a considerably more efficient and effective way for advertisers and publishers to transact with each other. Our goal is to become the programmatic display advertising industry standard for small and medium sized advertisers.
 
Our ATOS technology is proprietary and primarily consists of know-how and trade secrets developed internally, as well as certain open-source software.
 
Users of the ATOS platform get access to benefits including among other things:
 

· | ease of set up;

The Data Intelligence Platform
 
Our data intelligence platform provides precise data and insights on consumer’s real-world behavior and trends for use in marketing and research. We believe, based on our experience in our industry, that we provide one of the most accurate and scaled solutions for data collection and analysis, utilizing multiple proprietary technologies. Our data intelligence platform technology allows for the ingestion and normalization of various data sources, such as location data, transactional data, contextual data, and search data to reach the right target audience with the right message. Utilizing massively parallel cluster computing and machine learning algorithms and technology, our data intelligence solutions make available actionable data for marketers, researchers and application publishers through an automated platform. We are seeking to generate several revenue streams from our data collection and analysis, including, among other things; advertising, data licensing, attribution reporting, and custom research.
 
We also offer a self-service alternative through our MobiExchange product, which is a SaaS fee model. MobiExchange is a data focused technology solution that enables individuals and companies to rapidly build actionable data and insights for their own use or for resale.

Our data intelligence platform is hosted and managed on Amazon Web Service (AWS) and takes full advantage of open standards for processing, storage, security and big data technology. Specifically, our data intelligence platform uses the following AWS services: EC2, Lambda, Kafka, Kinesis, S3, Storm, Spark, Machine Learning, RDS, Redshift, Elastic Map Reduction, CloudWatch, DataBricks, and Elastic Search Service with built-in Kibana integration.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our strategy in the programmatic advertising space is to provide small- to medium-sized enterprises with an efficient and effective end-to-end, fully integrated ATOS platform. We believe that our ATOS platform gives users in these markets the capability of running marketing and branding campaigns without the need for an extensive marketing team, which enables them to better compete with their larger competitors who have greater marketing financial and human capital resources. Our sales and marketing approach is focused on providing a de-fragmented operating system that facilitates a considerably more efficient and effective way for advertisers and publishers to transact with each other. Our goal is to become the programmatic display advertising industry standard for small- and medium-sized advertisers. Mobiquity plans to hire several new sales and sales support individuals to help generate additional revenue through the use of our ATOS platform.
 
Our strategy is based on a problem we perceived in the advertising technology industry as it has rapidly grown over the last 10 years. We viewed the technology in the industry to be highly fragmented and thus inefficient. Many advertisers have had to mix multiple vendors’ different technologies, or bolt-on third-party technology to legacy technology, in an effort to create an integrated solution. Often this has resulted in the absence of a central source to address problems with an integrated system that arise. The flaws that this type of stacked technology ecosystem has includes:
 

· | Increased cost -- this results from integration costs, technology management costs and revenue sharing arrangements among vendors providing different components of the system. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Decreased speed -- the automated buying and selling of digital advertising space happens in micro-seconds and when the technology stack comprising the system has to work through several distinct vendor components, the system is inherently slower than a single vendor all-inclusive platform. 
· | Lack of transparency – a digital programmatic advertising campaign is comprised of a multitude of metrics each of which can be optimized by the advertiser according to its needs. Lack of transparency occurs when the digital programmatic advertising campaign jumps from its primary platform to the add-on vendors’ platform and the advertiser is unable to see or access certain of the metrics covered by a particular vendor’s component. The user thus loses the ability to optimize that part of the campaign. This is exacerbated as more add-on technologies are added to the system.

 
We believe our products address and solve the flaws of a stacked system.

A typical digital advertising campaign requires the following components:
 

· | Data Management Platform (or DMP)
--+----------------------------------
· | Demand-Side Platform (or DSP) 
· | Supply-Side Platform (or DSP) 
· | Bidder 
· | Ad Server 
· | Ad Network 
· | Supply Quality Tools 
· | Fraud Detection 
· | Analytical Tools 
· | Reporting Dashboard 

 
Many of the companies we target have between 50-70% of the above components and outsource the rest to vendors who bolt-on technology to those companies’ legacy technology which often results in the flaws discussed above. We provide a single-vendor end-to-end solution integrating the required components from a single source that work together because they are built together, in an effective and cost-efficient way. Our ATOS platform decreases the effective cost-basis for users by integrating all the necessary capabilities at no additional cost: DSP and bidding technologies, AdCop™ Fraud Protection, rich media and ad serving, attribution, reporting dashboard and DMP are all included.
 
Our Revenue Streams
 
We target brands, advertising agencies and other advertising technology companies as our audience for our ATOS platform products. The ATOS platform creates three revenue streams.
 

· | The first is licensing the ATOS platform as a white-label product for use by advertising agencies, demand-side platforms (or DSP’s), brands and publishers. Under the white-label scenario, the user licenses the ATOS platform from us and is responsible for running its own business operations and is billed a percentage of amounts spent on advertising run through the platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The second revenue stream is a managed services model, in which, the user is billed a higher percentage of revenue run through the platform, but all services are managed by us. 
· | The third revenue model is a seat model in which our customer uses our platform and we provide customer service but the customer does everything else, where the user is billed a percentage of revenue run through the platform and business operations are shared between the user and us.

Our data intelligence revenue is driven by managed services for advertising agencies; brands; market researchers; university research departments; healthcare; and financial, sports, pet, civil planning, transportation, and other data and technology companies. Often-times sales to users of our data intelligence platform will lead to them to our ATOS platform as well.
 
Our Intellectual Property
 
Our portfolio of technology consists of various intellectual property including proprietary source code, trade secrets and know-how that we have developed internally. We own our technology, although we use open source software for certain aspects, and we protect it though trade secrets and confidentiality requirements set out in our employee handbook which each employee acknowledges, and assigning any technology creations and improvements to us. We also have two patents that relate to our location-based mobile advertising technology business which we are not operating. These patents and patents pending are not material to, or used in, our ATOS or data intelligence related technology that we use in our current operations.
Governmental Regulations
 
Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we collect. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, self-regulatory requirements and legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, including those relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. As we develop and provide solutions that address new market segments, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs or restrict our operations. From time to time, we may be notified of or otherwise become aware of additional laws and regulations that governmental organizations or others may claim should be applicable to our business. Our failure to anticipate the application of these laws and regulations accurately, or other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity or cause us to alter our business practices, which could cause our net revenues to decrease, our costs to increase or our business otherwise to be harmed. See “Item 1A.”
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet, e-commerce and m-commerce in a number of jurisdictions around the world. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce, m-commerce or other online services. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, data protection, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts, electronic communications and consumer protection. It is not clear how existing laws and regulations governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet, e-commerce or m-commerce. It is possible that general business regulations and laws, or those specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce or m-commerce may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. See “Item 1A.”
 
Competition
 
We compete in the data, marketing and research business and in all other facets of our business against small, medium and large companies throughout the United States. Some examples include companies such as Liveramp, Groundtruth and Nielsen. Although we can give no assurance that our business will be able to compete against other companies with greater experience and resources, we believe we have a competitive advantage with our proprietary software and technology platform based on our view that our competitor’s products do not provide the end-to-end solutions that our product solutions do, and their minimum fees are substantially higher than ours for a comparative suite of solutions. See “Item 1A.”

Employees and Contractors
 
As of December 31, 2021, we have 13 employees, including executive management, technical personnel, salespeople, and support staff employees. We also utilize several additional firms/persons who provide services to us on a non-exclusive basis as independent consultants.
Customers
 
During 2020, sales of our products to four customers generated approximately 36% of our revenues. During 2021, sales of our products to four customers generated approximately 31% of our revenues. Our contracts with our customers generally do not obligate them to a specified term and they can generally terminate their relationship with us at any time with a minimal amount of notice.
Debt and Receivables Purchase Financing
 
We have the following debt financing in place:
 
Gene Salkind, who is our Chairman of the Board and one of our directors, and his affiliate provided us an aggregate of $2,700,000 in convertible debt financing for convertible promissory notes and common stock purchase warrants. Dr. Salkind’s principal debt was reduced to $2,562,500 in December 2021. See “Item 13.”
 
Business Capital Providers, Inc. purchased certain future receivables from the Company at a 26% discount under the following agreements on the following terms:

Under the agreement, the Company agrees to have all receivables collected be deposited into a bank account from which the purchased receivables are remitted to Business Capital Providers daily, at the daily percentage of 9% of the daily banking deposits, or daily amounts of $2,531.25, for the term of 160 days. The Company is responsible for ensuring there are sufficient funds in the account to cover the daily payments. Under the agreement, the Company paid an origination fee of 5% of the purchase price. In the event of a default under the agreement, Business Capital Providers may institute an action to enforce its rights, including recovery of its costs of enforcement. Events of default under the agreement include, among others: the Company’s breach of any provision or representation under the agreement; failure to give 24 hours’ notice there will be insufficient funds to cover a daily remittance; the Company offers for sale or sells a substantial portion of its assets or its business; the Company uses other depository accounts, or closes or changes its depository account from which daily remittances are made; a material change in the Company’s operations; loss of a key employee, customer or supplier of the Company; any change in stock float, voting rights or issuance of voting shares; the Company’s failure to renew a real property lease; any Company default under another agreement with Business Capital Providers; or any form of bankruptcy filing or declaration by or for the Company.

On September 20, 2021, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements, with two accredited investors, Talos Victory Fund, LLC and Blue Lake Partners LLC, pursuant to which the Company issued 10% promissory notes with a maturity date of September 20, 2022, in the aggregate principal amount of $1,125,000. In addition, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 56,250 shares of its common stock to these holders. Spartan Capital Securities LLC and Revere Securities LLC acted as placement agents on this transaction. The promissory notes include the following terms:
 

· | Interest at the annual rate of 10%. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The notes carry original issue discount of $112,500 in the aggregate. Accordingly, the total net principal of this debt was $1,012,500. 
· | The Company is required to make interim payments to the holders in the aggregate amount of $225,000, on or before March 18, 2022, towards the repayment of the balance of the notes. The Company may prepay the principal sum under the notes then outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest in full at any time without any prepayment premium; however, the Company is required to pay a minimum amount of the first 12 months of interest under the notes 
· | The holders may convert the notes and exercise the warrants into the Company’s common stock (subject to contractual beneficial ownership limitations of 4.99%). The holders have the right to convert the notes at any time into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $5.00 per share; provided, however, if the Company consummates a so-called uplisting offering to a national exchange within 180 days after the closing date, then the Note conversion price shall adjust to equal 70% of the price per share of common stock in that offering.

The Company acquired 3% of the Advangelists’ membership interests from Glen Eagles in April 2019 in satisfaction of the Company’s $500,000 closing payment advance to Glen Eagles, resulting in Mobiquity owning 51% and Glen Eagles owning 49% of Advangelists.
 
In May 2019 the Company acquired the remaining 49% of Advangelists’ membership interests from Glen Eagles, becoming the 100% owner of Advangelists, in a transaction involving the Company, Glen Eagles, and Gopher Protocol, Inc. In that transaction, Gopher acquired the 49% Advangelists membership interest from Glen Eagles and assumed Glen Eagles’ promissory note to Deepanker Katyal, as representative of the pre-merger Advangelists owners, which had a remaining balance of $7,512,500, in satisfaction of indebtedness owed by Glen Eagles to Gopher. Concurrently with that transaction, the Company acquired the 49% of Advangelists membership interest from Gopher and assumed the promissory note in consideration. Additionally, warrants for 300,000 shares of Company common stock which are issuable upon the conversion of Mobiquity Class AAA preferred stock owned by Gopher were amended to provide for a cashless exercise. In September 2019, the assumed note, which then had a principal balance of $6,780,000, was amended and restated to provide that:
 

· | $5,250,000 of the principal was payable in 65,625 shares of the Company’s Class E Preferred Stock, which is convertible into 164,062.50 shares the Company’s common stock, plus warrants to purchase 82,031.25 Company shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $48 per share; and

· | $1,530,000 of the principal balance, plus all accrued and unpaid interest under the promissory note was payable in three monthly installments of $510,000 each.
