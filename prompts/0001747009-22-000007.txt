Item 1.        Business
Overview of the Company
Equitrans Midstream is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S. and holds a significant transmission footprint in the Appalachian Basin. Equitrans Midstream, a Pennsylvania corporation, became an independent, publicly traded company on November 12, 2018, as a result of the Separation (as defined below).
The Separation. On November 12, 2018, Equitrans Midstream, EQT and, for certain limited purposes, EQT Production Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of EQT, entered into a separation and distribution agreement (the Separation and Distribution Agreement), pursuant to which, among other things, EQT effected the separation of its midstream business, which was composed of the assets and liabilities of the separately-operated natural gas gathering, transmission and storage and water services operations of EQT (the Midstream Business), from EQT's upstream business, which was composed of the natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids development, production and sales and commercial operations of EQT (the Separation), to Equitrans Midstream, and distributed 80.1% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock, no par value, of Equitrans Midstream (Equitrans Midstream common stock) to EQT shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 1, 2018 (the Distribution).
In connection with the Separation, the Company acquired control of the entities conducting the Midstream Business. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the entities conducting the Midstream Business.
The Company's Post-Separation Relationship with EQT. The Company and EQT are separate companies with separate management teams and separate boards of directors. Although they operate separately, due to the approximately 5.3% of Equitrans Midstream's outstanding shares of common stock held by EQT as of December 31, 2021, the Company and EQT are characterized for certain purposes as related parties. In connection with the Separation and Distribution, the Company and EQT executed the Separation and Distribution Agreement and various other agreements to effect the Separation. See Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the relationship between the Company and EQT subsequent to the Separation.
EQGP Unit Purchases and Limited Call Right. On November 29, 2018, the Company entered into written agreements (the Unit Purchase Agreements) with certain investors owning an aggregate of 15,364,421 common units representing limited partner interests in EQGP (EQGP common units) for $20.00 per EQGP common unit that closed through a series of transactions ending on January 3, 2019 for an aggregate purchase price of $307.3 million (collectively, the EQGP Unit Purchases). 
On December 31, 2018, the Company exercised a limited call right (the Limited Call Right) under EQGP's partnership agreement, pursuant to which, on January 10, 2019, the Company closed on the acquisition of the remaining 11,097,287 outstanding EQGP common units not owned by the Company or its affiliates for an aggregate purchase price of $221.9 million (such acquisition, together with the EQGP Unit Purchases, the EQGP Buyout), and EQGP became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the EQGP Buyout.
EQM IDR Transaction. On February 22, 2019, Equitrans Midstream completed a simplification transaction pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 13, 2019 (the IDR Merger Agreement), by and among Equitrans Midstream and certain related parties, pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Equitrans Merger Sub, LP merged with and into EQGP (the Merger) with EQGP continuing as the surviving limited partnership and a wholly owned subsidiary of EQM, and (ii) each of (a) the IDRs in EQM, (b) the economic portion of the general partner interest in EQM and (c) the issued and outstanding EQGP common units were canceled, and, as consideration for such cancellation, certain affiliates of the Company received on a pro rata basis 80,000,000 newly-issued common units representing limited partner interests in EQM (EQM common units) and 7,000,000 newly-issued Class B units representing limited partner interests in EQM (Class B units), and EQGP Services, LLC (the EQM General Partner) retained the non-economic general partner interest in EQM (such transactions, collectively, the EQM IDR Transaction). Additionally, as part of the EQM IDR Transaction, the 21,811,643 EQM common units held by EQGP were canceled and 21,811,643 EQM common units were issued pro rata to certain subsidiaries of the Company. As a result of the EQM IDR Transaction, the EQM General Partner replaced EQM Midstream Services, LLC as the general partner of EQM. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the EQM IDR Transaction.
EQM Series A Preferred Units. On March 13, 2019, EQM entered into a Convertible Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement, together with Joinder Agreements entered into on March 18, 2019, with certain investors (such investors, collectively, the Investors) to issue and sell in a private placement (the Private Placement) an aggregate of 24,605,291 Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Units (EQM Series A Preferred Units) representing limited partner interests in EQM for a cash purchase 
price of $48.77 per EQM Series A Preferred Unit, resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. The net proceeds from the Private Placement were used in part to fund the purchase price in the Bolt-on Acquisition (as defined in Note 3) and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Bolt-on Acquisition, and the remainder was used for general partnership purposes. The Private Placement closed concurrently with the closing of the Bolt-on Acquisition on April 10, 2019.

Upon consummation of the EQM Merger, the Company acquired all of the outstanding EQM common units that the Company and its subsidiaries did not already own. Following the closing of the EQM Merger, EQM was no longer a publicly traded entity. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the EQM Merger.
Preferred Restructuring Agreement. On February 26, 2020, the Company and EQM entered into a Preferred Restructuring Agreement (the Restructuring Agreement) with all of the Investors pursuant to which, at the effective time of the EQM Merger (the Effective Time): (i) EQM redeemed $600 million aggregate principal amount of the Investors' EQM Series A Preferred Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Restructuring Closing (as defined below), which occurred substantially concurrent with the closing of the EQM Merger, for cash at 101% of the EQM Series A Preferred Unit purchase price of $48.77 per such unit (the EQM Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Price) plus any accrued and unpaid distribution amounts and partial period distribution amounts, and (ii) immediately following such redemption, each remaining issued and outstanding EQM Series A Preferred Unit was exchanged for 2.44 shares of a newly authorized and created series of preferred stock, without par value, of Equitrans Midstream, convertible into Equitrans Midstream common stock (the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares) on a one for one basis, in each case, in connection with the occurrence of the “Series A Change of Control” (as defined in the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of EQM (as amended, the Former EQM Partnership Agreement)) that occurred upon the closing of the EQM Merger (collectively, the Restructuring and, the closing of the Restructuring, the Restructuring Closing). See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Restructuring Agreement and the Restructuring.
The EQT Global GGA. On February 26, 2020 (the EQT Global GGA Effective Date), the Company entered into a Gas Gathering and Compression Agreement (the EQT Global GGA) with EQT for the provision by the Company of certain gas gathering services to EQT in the Marcellus and Utica Shales of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Pursuant to the EQT Global GGA, EQT is subject to an initial annual MVC of 3.0 Bcf per day that gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day through December 2031 following the full in-service date of the MVP. The EQT Global GGA runs from the EQT Global GGA Effective Date through December 31, 2035, and will renew annually thereafter unless terminated by EQT or the Company pursuant to its terms. Pursuant to the EQT Global GGA, the Company has certain obligations to build connections to connect EQT wells to its gathering system, which are subject to geographical limitations in relation to the dedicated area in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, as well as the distance of such connections to the Company's then-existing gathering system. In addition to the fees related to gathering services, the EQT Global GGA provides for potential cash bonus payments payable by EQT to the Company during the period beginning on the first day of the calendar quarter in which the MVP full in-service date occurs through the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2024 (the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision). The potential cash bonus payments are conditioned upon the quarterly average of certain Henry Hub natural gas prices exceeding certain price thresholds.
The gathering MVC fees payable by EQT to the Company set forth in the EQT Global GGA are subject to potential reductions for certain contract years as set forth in the EQT Global GGA, conditioned to begin the first day of the quarter in which the full in-service date of the MVP occurs, which provide for estimated aggregate fee relief of approximately $270 million in the first twelve-month period, approximately $230 million in the second twelve-month period and approximately $35 million in the third twelve-month period. Further, the EQT Global GGA provides for a fee credit to the gathering rate for certain gathered volumes that also receive separate transmission services under certain transmission contracts. In addition, given that the MVP full in-service date did not occur by January 1, 2022, EQT has an option, exercisable through December 31, 2022, to forgo approximately $145 million of the gathering fee relief in such first twelve-month period and approximately $90 million of the gathering fee relief in such second twelve-month period in exchange for a cash payment from the Company to EQT in the amount of approximately $196 million (the EQT Cash Option). See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the EQT Global GGA.
Credit Letter Agreement. On February 26, 2020, in connection with the execution of the EQT Global GGA, the Company and EQT entered into a letter agreement (the Credit Letter Agreement) pursuant to which, among other things, (a) the Company 
agreed to relieve certain credit posting requirements for EQT, in an amount up to approximately $250 million, under its commercial agreements with the Company, subject to EQT maintaining a minimum credit rating from two of three rating agencies of (i) Ba3 with Moody’s Investors Service (Moody's), (ii) BB- with S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and (iii) BB- with Fitch Investor Services (Fitch) and (b) the Company agreed to use commercially reasonable good faith efforts to negotiate similar credit support arrangements for EQT in respect of its commitments to the MVP Joint Venture.
Water Services Letter Agreement and 2021 Water Services Agreement. On February 26, 2020, the Company entered into a letter agreement with EQT relating to the provision of water services in Pennsylvania (such letter agreement, the Water Services Letter Agreement). Subject to the effect of the 2021 Water Services Agreement (as defined below), the Water Services Letter Agreement would have been effective as of the first day of the first month following the MVP full in-service date and would have expired on the fifth anniversary of such date. During each year of the Water Services Letter Agreement, EQT had agreed to pay the Company a minimum $60 million per year annual revenue commitment (ARC) for volumetric water services provided in Pennsylvania, all in accordance with existing water service agreements and new water service agreements entered into between the parties pursuant to the Water Services Letter Agreement (or the related agreements). 
On October 22, 2021, the Company and EQT entered into a new 10-year, mixed-use water services agreement covering operations within a dedicated area in southwestern Pennsylvania (as subsequently amended, the 2021 Water Services Agreement). The 2021 Water Services Agreement, which, upon its effectiveness, replaces the Water Services Letter Agreement and certain other existing Pennsylvania water services agreements, will become effective with the commencement of water delivery service to a certain EQT well pad (anticipated in the first quarter of 2022). Pursuant to the 2021 Water Services Agreement, EQT has agreed to pay the Company a minimum ARC for water services equal to $40 million in each of the first five years of the 10-year contract term and equal to $35 million per year for the remaining five years of the contract term.
Share Purchase Agreements. On February 26, 2020, the Company entered into two share purchase agreements (the Share Purchase Agreements) with EQT, pursuant to which the Company agreed to (i) purchase 4,769,496 shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock (the Cash Shares) from EQT in exchange for approximately $46 million in cash, (ii) purchase 20,530,256 shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock (the Rate Relief Shares and, together with the Cash Shares, the Share Purchases) from EQT in exchange for a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $196 million (which EQT subsequently assigned to EQM as consideration for certain commercial terms under the EQT Global GGA), and (iii) pay EQT cash in the amount of approximately $7 million (the Cash Amount). On March 5, 2020, the Company completed the Share Purchases and paid the Cash Amount. The Company used proceeds from the EQM Credit Facility (as defined in Note 11) to fund the purchase of the Cash Shares and to pay the Cash Amount in addition to other uses of proceeds. After the closing of the Share Purchases, the Company retired the Cash Shares and the Rate Relief Shares. On September 29, 2020, the Company made a prepayment to EQM of all principal, interest, fees and other obligations outstanding under the promissory note EQT assigned to EQM and the promissory note was terminated. 
The following diagram depicts the Company's organizational and ownership structure as of December 31, 2021: 
Overview of Operations
The Company provides midstream services to its customers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio through its three primary assets: the gathering system, which includes predominantly dry gas gathering systems of high-pressure gathering lines; the transmission system, which includes FERC-regulated interstate pipelines and storage systems; and the water network, which primarily consists of water pipelines and other facilities that support well completion and produced water handling activities.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company provided a majority of its natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services under long-term contracts that generally include firm reservation fees. The Company maintains a stable cash flow profile, with approximately 64% of the Company's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 generated from firm reservation fees. The percentage of the Company's revenues that are generated by firm reservation fees is expected to increase in future years as a result of the 15-year term EQT Global GGA, which includes an MVC of 3.0 Bcf per day that became effective on April 1, 2020 and gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day through December 2031 following the full in-service date of the MVP. These contract structures enhance the stability of the Company's cash flows and limit its exposure to customer volume variability. 
The Company's operations are focused primarily in southwestern Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and southeastern Ohio, which are prolific resource development areas in the natural gas shale plays known as the Marcellus and Utica Shales. These regions are also the primary operating areas of EQT, which was the largest natural gas producer in the United States based on average daily sales volumes as of December 31, 2021 and the Company's largest customer as of December 31, 2021. EQT accounted for approximately 59% of the Company's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The following is a map of the Company's gathering, transmission and storage and water services operations as of December 31, 2021. Also included are MVP and MVP Southgate routes, which projects are discussed in "Strategy" under "Developments, Market Trends and Competitive Conditions" in "Item 1. Business."
Business Segments
The Company reports its operations in three segments that reflect its three lines of business: Gathering, Transmission and Water. These segments include all of the Company's operations. For discussion of the composition of the three segments, see Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company's three business segments correspond to the Company's three primary assets: the gathering system, transmission and storage system and water service system. The following table summarizes the composition of the Company's operating revenues by business segment. 

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Gathering operating revenues | 66 | % | | 67 | % | 71 | %
Transmission operating revenues | 30 | % | | 26 | % | 24 | %
Water operating revenues | 4 | % | | 7 | % | 7 | %

The Company's largest customer, EQT, accounted for approximately 59%, 64% and 69% of the Company's total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Gathering Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, EQT accounted for approximately 59% of Gathering's revenues. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, as of December 31, 2021, Gathering (inclusive of acreage dedications to Eureka Midstream Holdings, LLC (Eureka Midstream), a joint venture in which the Company has a 60% interest and that owns a 265-mile gathering header pipeline system in Ohio and West Virginia that services both dry Utica and wet Marcellus Shale production) had significant acreage dedications through which the Company has the right to elect to gather all natural gas produced from wells under dedicated areas in (i) Pennsylvania pursuant to agreements with EQT, including the EQT Global GGA, and agreements with certain other third parties, (ii) Ohio pursuant to agreements with EQT and other third parties, and (iii) West Virginia pursuant to the EQT Global GGA and agreements with certain other third parties. 
The Company provides gathering services in two manners: firm service and interruptible service. Firm service contracts are typically long-term and often include firm reservation fees, which are fixed, monthly charges for the guaranteed reservation of pipeline access. Revenues under firm reservation fees also include fixed volumetric charges under MVCs. As of December 31, 2021, the gathering system had total contracted firm reservation capacity (including contracted MVCs) of approximately 7.0 Bcf per day (inclusive of Eureka Midstream contracted capacity), which included contracted firm reservation capacity of approximately 1.8 Bcf per day associated with the Company's high-pressure header pipelines. Including future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which the Company has executed firm contracts, the gathering system had total contracted firm reservation capacity (including contracted MVCs) of approximately 8.1 Bcf per day (inclusive of Eureka Midstream contracted capacity) as of December 31, 2021, which included contracted firm reservation capacity of approximately 1.8 Bcf per day associated with the Company's high-pressure header pipelines. Volumetric-based fees can also be charged under firm contracts for each firm volume gathered, as well as for volumes gathered in excess of the firm contracted volume. Based on total projected contractual revenues, including projected contractual revenues from future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which the Company has executed firm contracts, the Company's firm gathering contracts had a weighted average remaining term of approximately 14 years as of December 31, 2021. 
Interruptible service contracts include volumetric-based fees, which are charges for the volume of natural gas gathered and generally do not guarantee access to the pipeline. These contracts can be short- or long-term. To the extent that capacity reserved by customers with firm service contracts is not fully used or excess capacity exists, the gathering system can allocate capacity to interruptible services. 
The Company generally does not take title to the natural gas gathered for its customers but retains a percentage of wellhead gas receipts to recover natural gas used to power certain of its compressor stations and meet other requirements on the Company's gathering systems. 
Transmission Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, EQT accounted for approximately 62% of Transmission's throughput and approximately 53% of Transmission's revenues. As of December 31, 2021, Transmission had an acreage dedication from EQT through which the Company had the right to elect to transport all gas produced from wells drilled by EQT under dedicated areas in Allegheny, Washington and Greene Counties in Pennsylvania and Wetzel, Marion, Taylor, Tyler, Doddridge, Harrison and Lewis Counties in West Virginia. The Company's other customers include LDCs, marketers, producers and commercial and industrial users. The Company's transmission and storage system provides customers with 
access to markets in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio and to the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, Midwestern and Gulf Coast markets through interconnect points with major interstate pipelines.
The Company provides transmission and storage services in two manners: firm service and interruptible service. Firm service contracts are typically long-term and often include firm reservation fees, which are fixed, monthly charges for the guaranteed reservation of pipeline and storage capacity. Volumetric-based fees can also be charged under firm contracts for firm volume transported or stored, as well as for volumes transported or stored in excess of the firm contracted volume. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had firm capacity subscribed under firm transmission contracts of approximately 5.6 Bcf per day, which includes future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which the Company has executed firm transmission contracts and excludes 2.3 Bcf per day of firm capacity commitments associated with the MVP and MVP Southgate projects. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had firm storage capacity of approximately 29.8 Bcf subscribed under firm storage contracts. Based on total projected contractual revenues, including projected contractual revenues from future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which the Company has executed firm contracts, the Company's firm transmission and storage contracts had a weighted average remaining term of approximately 13 years as of December 31, 2021.
Interruptible service contracts include volumetric-based fees, which are charges for the volume of natural gas transported and generally do not guarantee access to the pipeline or storage facility. These contracts can be short- or long-term. To the extent that capacity reserved by customers with firm service contracts is not fully used or excess capacity exists, the transmission and storage systems can allocate capacity to interruptible services. 
The Company generally does not take title to the natural gas transported or stored for its customers but retains a percentage of gas receipts to recover natural gas used to power its compressor stations and meet other requirements of the Company's transmission and storage systems.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 97% of Transmission's contracted firm transmission capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under its tariff, while the remainder was subscribed at discounted rates under its tariff, which are rates below the recourse rates and above a minimum level. As of December 31, 2021, Transmission did not have any contracted firm transmission capacity subscribed at recourse rates under its tariff, which are the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff. See also "FERC Regulation" under "Regulatory Environment" below and "Our natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes in or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities, and related litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends.” included in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for additional information.
Water Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, EQT accounted for approximately 96% of Water's revenues. The Company has the exclusive right to provide fluid handling services to certain EQT-operated wells through 2029 (and thereafter such right continues on a month-to-month basis) within areas of dedication in Belmont County, Ohio, including the delivery of fresh water for well completion operations and the collection and recycling or disposal of flowback and produced water. The Company also provides water services to other customers operating in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. Upon commencement of the 2021 Water Services Agreement, the majority of the Company's water service revenues will be subject to an ARC with EQT.
See also "Water Services Letter Agreement" and "2021 Water Services Agreement" above for additional information on the Company's Water customers.
The Company's Assets
Gathering Assets. As of December 31, 2021, the gathering system, inclusive of Eureka Midstream's gathering system, included approximately 1,170 miles of high-pressure gathering lines and 133 compressor units with compression of approximately 491,000 horsepower and multiple interconnect points with the Company's transmission and storage system and to other interstate pipelines. 
Transmission and Storage Assets. As of December 31, 2021, the transmission and storage system included approximately 950 miles of FERC-regulated, interstate pipelines that have interconnect points to seven interstate pipelines and multiple LDCs. As of December 31, 2021, the transmission and storage system was supported by 43 compressor units, with total throughput capacity of approximately 4.4 Bcf per day and compression of approximately 136,000 horsepower, and 18 associated natural gas storage reservoirs, which had a peak withdrawal capacity of approximately 850 MMcf per day and a working gas capacity of approximately 43 Bcf.
Water Assets. As of December 31, 2021, the fresh water systems included approximately 200 miles of pipeline that deliver fresh water from local municipal water authorities, the Monongahela River, the Ohio River, local reservoirs and several regional waterways. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, the water system assets included 23 fresh water impoundment facilities.
During 2021, the Company began construction of a mixed water system in Greene County, Pennsylvania. The system has a targeted full in-service date of summer 2022 and is primarily supported by the 2021 Water Services Agreement. The mixed water system is designed to include 71 miles of buried water pipeline, two water storage facilities with 350,000 barrels of capacity and two interconnects with the Company’s existing Pennsylvania fresh water systems and will provide services to producers in southwestern Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s mixed water system included approximately eight miles of buried pipeline. 
Developments, Market Trends and Competitive Conditions
The Company's strategically-located assets overlay core acreage in the Appalachian Basin. The location of the Company's assets allows its producer customers to access major demand markets in the U.S. The Company is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S., and its largest customer, EQT, was the largest natural gas producer in the U.S. based on average daily sales volumes as of December 31, 2021. The Company maintains a stable cash flow profile, with approximately 64% of its operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 generated from firm reservation fees. Further, as discussed above, the percentage of the Company's revenues that are generated by firm reservation fees is expected to increase in future years as a result of the 15-year term EQT Global GGA, which includes an MVC of 3.0 Bcf per day that became effective on April 1, 2020 and gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day through December 2031 following the full in-service date of the MVP. This contract structure enhances the stability of the Company's cash flows and limits its exposure to customer volume variability.
Strategy. The Company's principal strategy is to achieve greater scale and scope, enhance the durability of its financial strength and to continue to work to position itself for a lower carbon economy, which strategy the Company expects will drive future growth and investment. The Company is implementing its strategy by continuing to leverage its existing assets, execute on its growth projects (including through potential expansion and extension opportunities), periodically evaluate strategically-aligned inorganic growth opportunities (whether within its existing footprint or to extend the Company's reach into the southeast United States to become closer to key demand markets, such as the Gulf of Mexico LNG export market), and focus on ESG and sustainability-oriented initiatives. Additionally, the Company is also continuing to focus on strengthening its balance sheet through:
•highly predictable cash flows backed by firm reservation fees;
•actions to de-lever its balance sheet;
•disciplined capital spending; 
•operating cost control; and 
•an appropriate dividend policy. 
As part of its approach to organic growth, the Company is focused on its projects and assets outlined below, many of which are supported by contracts with firm capacity or MVC commitments. 
The Company expects that the MVP project (should it be placed in-service), together with the Hammerhead pipeline and Equitrans, L.P. Expansion Project (EEP), will primarily drive the Company's organic growth, as discussed in further detail below.
•Mountain Valley Pipeline. The MVP is being constructed by a joint venture among the Company and affiliates of each of NextEra Energy, Inc., Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), AltaGas Ltd. and RGC Resources, Inc. As of December 31, 2021, the Company owned an approximate 46.8% interest in the MVP project and will operate the MVP. The MVP is an estimated 300-mile, 42-inch diameter natural gas interstate pipeline with a targeted capacity of 2.0 Bcf per day that is designed to span from the Company's existing transmission and storage system in Wetzel County, West Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia, providing access to the growing southeast demand markets. The MVP Joint Venture has secured a total of 2.0 Bcf per day of firm capacity commitments at 20-year terms. Additional shippers have expressed interest in the MVP project and the MVP Joint Venture is evaluating an expansion opportunity that could add approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of capacity through the installation of incremental compression.
In October 2017, the FERC issued the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (the Certificate) for the MVP. In the first quarter of 2018, the MVP Joint Venture received limited notice to proceed with certain construction 
activities from the FERC and commenced construction. Following a comprehensive review of all outstanding stream and wetland crossings across the approximately 300-mile MVP project route, on February 19, 2021, the MVP Joint Venture submitted (i) a joint application package to each of the Huntington, Pittsburgh and Norfolk Districts of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) that requested an Individual Permit from the Army Corps to effect approximately 300 water crossings utilizing open cut techniques (the Army Corps Individual Permit) and (ii) an application to amend the Certificate that seeks FERC authority to utilize alternative trenchless construction methods to effect approximately 120 water crossings. Related to seeking the Army Corps Individual Permit, on March 4, 2021, the MVP Joint Venture submitted applications to each of the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VADEQ) seeking Section 401 water quality certification approvals or waivers (such approvals or waivers, the State 401 Approvals), which State 401 Approvals were each received in December 2021. In early June 2021, the FERC issued a notice of schedule for the MVP Joint Venture's Certificate amendment application and the FERC issued an Environmental Assessment in mid-August 2021. As discussed in Part I, "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on January 25, 2022, the MVP Joint Venture's authorizations related to the Jefferson National Forest (JNF) received from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) were vacated and remanded on specific issues by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Fourth Circuit). As also discussed in Part I, "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on February 2, 2022, the Fourth Circuit vacated and remanded on specific issues the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement issued by the United States Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for the MVP project. The MVP Joint Venture continues to review these recent decisions and evaluate the possible paths forward, which include working with the relevant federal agencies and consideration of potential legal appeals. As a result, the Company is not able to provide an update as to the in-service timing and overall cost for the project, except that the Company is no longer targeting a summer 2022 in-service date.
In addition to timely receiving, and subsequently maintaining, new authorizations in respect of the JNF, and a Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement, the MVP Joint Venture must, in order to complete the project, among other things, timely receive (i) the Army Corps Individual Permit (as well as timely receive, if necessary, certain other state-level approvals), and (ii) authorization from the FERC to amend the Certificate to utilize alternative trenchless construction methods for certain stream and wetland crossings, as well as any necessary extensions from FERC to complete the MVP project. The MVP Joint Venture also must (i) continue to have available the orders previously issued by the FERC, which are the subject of ongoing litigation, modifying its prior stop work orders and extending the MVP Joint Venture’s prescribed time to complete the MVP project; and (ii) timely receive authorization from the FERC to complete construction work in the portion of the project route currently remaining subject to the FERC’s previous stop work order and in the JNF. In each case, any such foregoing or other authorizations must remain in effect notwithstanding any pending or future challenge thereto. For further information regarding litigation and regulatory related delays affecting the completion of the MVP project, see Part I, "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See also "The regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is very challenging, has significantly increased costs and delayed targeted in-service dates, and decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending or potential proceedings are likely to impact our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain or maintain in effect all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the targeted time frame or at all or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects." included in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for additional discussion. 
On November 4, 2019, Con Edison exercised an option to cap its investment in the construction of the MVP project at approximately $530 million (excluding AFUDC). The Company and NextEra Energy, Inc. are obligated, and RGC Resources, Inc., another member of the MVP Joint Venture owning an interest in the MVP project, has opted, to fund the shortfall in Con Edison's capital contributions on a pro rata basis. Such funding by the Company and funding by other members has and will correspondingly increase the Company's and such other members' respective interests in the MVP project and decrease Con Edison's interest in the MVP project. As a result, depending on the project's total cost, the Company's equity ownership in the MVP project will progressively increase to a percentage in excess of approximately 46.8%.
Through December 31, 2021, the Company had funded approximately $2.5 billion of its then-estimated total capital contributions. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made approximately $284 million of capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture for the MVP project. For 2022, the Company expects to make total capital contributions of approximately $175 million to $225 million related to work completed in late 2021 and ongoing right-of-way maintenance. 
•Wellhead Gathering Expansion Projects and Hammerhead Pipeline. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company invested approximately $224 million in gathering projects (inclusive of capital expenditures related to the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream). For 2022, the Company expects to invest approximately $270 million to 
$320 million in gathering projects (inclusive of expected capital expenditures of approximately $20 million related to the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream). The primary projects include infrastructure expansion of core development areas in the Marcellus and Utica Shales in southwestern Pennsylvania, southeastern Ohio and northern West Virginia for EQT, Range Resources Corporation (Range Resources) and other producers.
The Hammerhead pipeline is a 1.6 Bcf per day gathering header pipeline that is primarily designed to connect natural gas produced in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to the MVP, Texas Eastern Transmission and Dominion Transmission, is supported by a 20-year term, 1.2 Bcf per day, firm capacity commitment from EQT, and cost approximately $540 million. For more information, including regarding full commercial in-service status for the Hammerhead pipeline, see "Outlook" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
•Transmission Projects and Equitrans Expansion Project. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company invested approximately $26 million in transmission projects, including the EEP. The EEP is designed to provide north-to-south capacity on the mainline Equitrans, L.P. system, including primarily for deliveries to the MVP. A portion of the EEP commenced operations with interruptible service in the third quarter of 2019. The EEP provides capacity of approximately 600 MMcf per day and offers access to several markets through interconnects with Texas Eastern Transmission, Dominion Transmission and Columbia Gas Transmission. Once the MVP is fully placed in service, firm transportation agreements for 550 MMcf per day of capacity will commence under 20-year terms. 
For 2022, the Company expects to invest approximately $45 million in transmission projects, inclusive of capital expenditures expected for 2022 associated with the Company's Ohio Valley Connector expansion project (OVCX). OVCX will increase deliverability on the Company's existing Ohio Valley Connector pipeline (OVC) by approximately 350 MMcf per day, create new receipt and delivery transportation paths, and enhance long-term reliability. The project is supported by new long-term firm capacity commitments of 330 MMcf per day, as well as an extension of approximately 1.0 Bcf per day of existing contracted mainline capacity for EQT. OVCX is designed to meet growing demand in key markets in the mid-continent and gulf coast through existing interconnects with long-haul pipelines in Clarington, Ohio. The targeted in-service date for the incremental OVC capacity is the third quarter of 2023. The Company expects to invest approximately $160 million, which includes approximately $130 million for new compression. The project is consistent with the Company's ongoing efforts to optimize existing assets and achieve capital efficiency.
•MVP Southgate Project. In April 2018, the MVP Joint Venture announced the MVP Southgate project, which is a proposed 75-mile interstate pipeline that is contemplated to extend from the MVP at Pittsylvania County, Virginia to new delivery points in Rockingham and Alamance Counties, North Carolina. The MVP Southgate project is backed by a 300 MMcf per day firm capacity commitment from Dominion Energy North Carolina, and, as currently designed, reflects potential expansion capabilities that could provide up to 900 MMcf per day of total capacity. The Company is expected to operate the MVP Southgate project and owned a 47.2% interest in the MVP Southgate project as of December 31, 2021. 
The MVP Joint Venture submitted the MVP Southgate certificate application to the FERC in November 2018. The Final Environmental Impact Statement for the MVP Southgate project was issued on February 14, 2020. In June 2020, the FERC issued the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the MVP Southgate; however, the FERC, while authorizing the project, directed the Office of Energy Projects not to issue a notice to proceed with construction until necessary federal permits are received for the MVP project and the Director of the Office of Energy Projects lifts the stop work order and authorizes the MVP Joint Venture to continue constructing the MVP project. On August 11, 2020, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) denied the MVP Southgate project's application for a Clean Water Act Section 401 Individual Water Quality Certification and Jordan Lake Riparian Buffer Authorization due to uncertainty surrounding the completion of the MVP project. On March 11, 2021, the Fourth Circuit, pursuant to an appeal filed by the MVP Joint Venture, vacated the NCDEQ's denial and remanded the matter to the NCDEQ for additional review. On April 29, 2021, the NCDEQ reissued its denial of the MVP Southgate project's application for a Clean Water Act Section 401 Individual Water Quality Certification and Jordan Lake Riparian Buffer Authorization. On December 3, 2021, the Virginia State Air Pollution Control Board denied the permit for the MVP Southgate project’s Lambert compressor station, which decision the MVP Joint Venture has appealed (and such appeal is pending). See the discussion of litigation and regulatory related delays affecting the completion of the MVP Southgate project set forth in Part I, "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Given the continually evolving regulatory and legal environment for greenfield pipeline construction projects, as well as factors specific to the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, including the December 2021 compressor station state air permit denial, the MVP Joint Venture is evaluating the MVP Southgate project, including engaging in discussions with Dominion Energy North Carolina regarding options with respect to the MVP Southgate project, including potentially 
refining the project’s design and timing in lieu of pursuing the project as originally contemplated. Dominion Energy North Carolina’s obligations under the precedent agreement in support of the original project are subject to certain conditions, including that the MVP Joint Venture complete construction of the project facilities by June 1, 2022, which deadline is subject to extension by virtue of previously declared events of force majeure. The Company is unable to predict the results of the discussions between the MVP Joint Venture and Dominion Energy North Carolina, including any potential modifications to the project, or ultimate undertaking or completion of the project. 
The MVP Southgate project, as originally designed, was estimated to cost a total of approximately $450 million to $500 million, a portion of which the Company expected to fund. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made approximately $4 million of capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture for the MVP Southgate project. For 2022, the Company expects to make capital contributions of approximately $5 million to the MVP Joint Venture for the MVP Southgate project.
•Water Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company invested approximately $35 million in its water infrastructure. For 2022, the Company expects to invest approximately $50 million in the operations of its water infrastructure in Pennsylvania, primarily for the construction of the mixed water system.
See "Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility" in "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion of the Company's continued focus on ESG and sustainability matters which the Company believes will distinctively position the Company and create value.
Competitive Condition. Key competitors for new natural gas gathering systems include companies that own major natural gas pipelines, independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies. When compared to the Company or its customers, some of the Company's competitors have operations in multiple natural gas producing basins, have greater capital resources and access to, or control of, larger natural gas supplies.
Competition for natural gas transmission and storage is primarily based on rates, customer commitment levels, timing, performance, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, reputation and fuel efficiencies. The Company's principal competitors in its transmission and storage market include companies that own major natural gas pipelines in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. In addition, the Company competes with companies that are building high-pressure gathering facilities that are able to transport natural gas to interstate pipelines without being subject to FERC jurisdiction. Major natural gas transmission companies that compete with the Company also have storage facilities connected to their transmission systems that compete with certain of the Company's storage facilities.
Key competition for water services includes natural gas producers that develop their own water distribution systems in lieu of employing the Company's water services assets and other natural gas midstream companies that offer water services. The Company's ability to attract customers to its water service business depends on its ability to evaluate and select suitable projects and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
Further, natural gas as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including coal, liquid fuels and, increasingly, renewable and alternative energy. Demand for renewable and alternative energy is increasing generally with changes in consumer preferences, governmental clean energy policies, and as renewable and alternative energy becomes more cost competitive with traditional fuels and more widely available. Continued increases in the demand for renewable and alternative energy at the expense of natural gas (or increases in the demand for other sources of energy, particularly if prices for natural gas are elevated relative to other forms of energy as fuel) could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, transmission and storage, and water services.
Regulatory Environment
FERC Regulation. The Company's interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), and the regulations, rules and policies promulgated under those and other statutes. Certain portions of the Company's gathering operations are also currently rate-regulated by the FERC in connection with its interstate transmission operations. The Company's FERC-regulated operations are pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC that establish rates (other than market-based rate authority), cost recovery mechanisms and terms and conditions of service to its customers. Generally, the FERC's authority extends to:
•rates and charges for the Company's natural gas transmission and storage services and FERC-regulated gathering services;
•certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities;
•abandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities and certificated gathering facilities;
•maintenance of accounts and records;
•relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates;
•terms and conditions of services and service contracts with customers;
•depreciation and amortization policies;
•acquisitions and dispositions of interstate transmission and storage facilities; and
•initiation and discontinuation of interstate transmission and storage services.
The FERC regulates the rates and charges for transmission and storage in interstate commerce. Unless market-based rates have been approved by the FERC, the maximum applicable recourse rates and terms and conditions for service are set forth in the pipeline's FERC-approved tariff. Generally, the maximum filed recourse rates for interstate pipelines are based on the cost of providing service, including the recovery of a return on the pipeline's actual and prudent historical investment costs. Key determinants in the ratemaking process include the depreciated capital costs of the facilities, the costs of providing service, the allowed rate of return and income tax allowance, as well as volume throughput and contractual capacity commitment assumptions.
Interstate pipelines may not charge rates or impose terms and conditions of service that, upon review by the FERC, are found to be unjust or unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential. Rate design and the allocation of costs also can affect a pipeline's profitability. While the ratemaking process establishes the maximum rate that can be charged, interstate pipelines such as the Company's transmission and storage system are permitted to discount their firm and interruptible rates without further FERC authorization down to a specified minimum level, provided they do not unduly discriminate. In addition, pipelines are allowed to negotiate different rates with their customers, under certain circumstances. Changes to rates or terms and conditions of service, and contracts can be proposed by a pipeline company under Section 4 of the NGA, or the existing interstate transmission and storage rates or terms and conditions of service, and contracts may be challenged by a complaint filed by interested persons including customers, state agencies or the FERC under Section 5 of the NGA. Rate increases proposed by a pipeline may be allowed to become effective subject to refund and/or a period of suspension, while rates or terms and conditions of service that are the subject of a complaint under Section 5 of the NGA are subject to prospective change by the FERC. Rate increases proposed by a regulated interstate pipeline may be challenged and such increases may ultimately be rejected by the FERC. 
The Company's interstate pipeline may also use negotiated rates that could involve rates above or below the recourse rate or rates that are subject to a different rate structure than the rates specified in the Company's interstate pipeline tariffs, provided that the affected customers are willing to agree to such rates and that the FERC has approved the negotiated rate agreement. A prerequisite for allowing the negotiated rates is that negotiated rate customers must have had the option to take service under the pipeline's recourse rates. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 97% of the system's contracted firm transmission capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under its tariff. Some negotiated rate transactions are designed to fix the negotiated rate for the term of the firm transportation agreement and the fixed rate is generally not subject to adjustment for increased or decreased costs occurring during the contract term.
The FERC’s regulations also extend to the terms and conditions set forth in agreements for transmission and storage services executed between interstate pipelines and their customers. These service agreements are required to conform, in all material respects, with the form of service agreements set forth in the pipeline's FERC-approved tariff. Non-conforming agreements must be filed with and accepted by the FERC. In the event that the FERC finds that an agreement is materially non-conforming, in whole or in part, it could reject, or require the Company to seek modification of, the agreement, or alternatively require the Company to modify its tariff so that the non-conforming provisions are generally available to all customers or class of customers.
The FERC’s jurisdiction also extends to the certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, facility replacements and upgrades, expansions, and abandonment of facilities and services. While the FERC currently exercises jurisdiction over the rates and terms of service for the Company’s FERC-regulated gathering services, these gathering facilities may not be subject to the FERC’s certification and construction authority. Prior to commencing construction of new or existing interstate transmission and storage facilities, an interstate pipeline must obtain (except in certain circumstances, such as where the activity is permitted under the FERC’s regulations or is authorized under the operator’s existing blanket certificate issued by the FERC) a certificate authorizing the construction, or file to amend its existing certificate, from the FERC. 
On April 19, 2018, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry (2018 Notice of Inquiry) seeking information regarding whether, and if so how, it should revise its approach under its currently effective policy statement on the certification of new natural gas transportation facilities (Certificate Policy Statement). The formal comment period in this proceeding closed on June 25, 2018. On February 18, 2021, the FERC issued another Notice of Inquiry in the same proceeding that modified and expanded the inquiry and renewed its request for public comment (together with the 2018 Notice of Inquiry, the Certificate Policy Statement NOI). The formal comment period closed May 26, 2021. On February 18, 2022, the FERC issued an Updated Certificate Policy Statement. The Company is evaluating the Updated Certificate Policy Statement, but at this time, it is not possible to predict the impact that the Updated Certificate Policy will have on the Company, if any.
In 2021, Congress did not pass legislation revising the NGA or other statutes that may impact the Company's existing facilities and operations or the ability to construct new facilities, though that remains a possibility in 2022. Potential areas of revision include, but are not limited to, (i) amending Section 5 of the NGA to allow the FERC to require a pipeline to make refunds from the date that a NGA Section 5 complaint was filed with the FERC if rates are later found to be unjust and unreasonable; (ii) amending Section 7 of the NGA affecting the ability of companies to exercise eminent domain; and (iii) amending Section 19(b) of the NGA to provide the FERC additional time to act on requests for rehearing. 
Party control at the FERC changed in 2021, and the FERC reestablished its full complement of five commissioners. In 2021, FERC issued Order Nos. 871-B and -C (amending FERC regulations to prohibit the issuance of authorizations to proceed with construction while certain requests for rehearing are pending), demonstrated that it will consider climate change impacts in individual certificate proceedings, and incorporated enhanced environmental justice review in pipeline certificate orders. On February 18, 2022, the FERC issued an interim GHG policy. The Company is evaluating the interim GHG policy, but at this time, it is not possible to predict the impact that the interim GHG policy, or any future changes to that policy, will have on the Company, if any.
FERC Regulation of Gathering Rates and Terms of Service. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. While the FERC does not generally regulate the rates and terms of service over facilities determined to be performing a natural gas gathering function, it has traditionally regulated rates charged by interstate pipelines for gathering services performed on the pipeline's own gathering facilities when those gathering services are performed in connection with jurisdictional interstate transmission services. The Company currently maintains rates and terms of service in its tariff for unbundled gathering services performed on its gathering facilities in connection with the transmission service. Just as with rates and terms of service for transmission and storage services, the Company's rates and terms of service for its FERC-regulated low-pressure gathering system may be challenged by complaint and are subject to prospective change by the FERC. The Company has submitted an application to the FERC requesting authorization to abandon these low-pressure gathering facilities and services. As of December 31, 2021, the application remained pending before the FERC.
The Company believes that its high-pressure gathering systems meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish a pipeline's status as an exempt gatherer not subject to regulation as a jurisdictional natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is often the subject of litigation in the industry, so the classification and regulation of these systems are subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or the U.S. Congress.
Pipeline Safety and Maintenance. The Company's interstate natural gas pipeline system is subject to regulation by PHMSA. PHMSA has established safety requirements pertaining to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, including requirements that pipeline operators develop a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities and implement pipeline integrity management programs. These integrity management plans require more frequent inspections and other preventive measures to ensure safe operation of oil and natural gas transportation pipelines in high population areas or facilities that are hard to evacuate and areas of daily concentrations of people.
Notwithstanding the investigatory and preventative maintenance costs incurred in the Company's performance of customary pipeline management activities, the Company may incur significant additional expenses if anomalous pipeline conditions are discovered or more stringent pipeline safety requirements are implemented. For example, in April 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing several integrity management topics and proposing new requirements to address safety issues for natural gas transmission and gathering lines (the Mega Rule). The proposed Mega Rule would strengthen existing integrity management requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities and extend regulatory requirements to onshore gas gathering lines that are currently exempt. Part one of the Mega Rule was finalized on July 1, 2020 (see discussion below). Part three of the Mega Rule was finalized on November 15, 2021, with an effective date of May 16, 2022 (see discussion below). Part two of the Mega Rule will now be the final portion 
addressed by a future rulemaking activity which remains under development, and no expected date for finalization has been released by PHMSA.
Further, in June 2016, then-President Obama signed the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act), extending PHMSA's statutory mandate under prior legislation through 2019. In addition, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act empowered PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing and also required PHMSA to develop new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 2018. Pursuant to those provisions of the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, PHMSA issued two separate Interim Final Rules in October 2016 and December 2016 that expanded the agency's authority to impose emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures and strengthened the rules related to underground natural gas storage facilities, including well integrity, wellbore tubing and casing integrity. The December 2016 Interim Final Rule, relating to underground gas storage facilities, went into effect in January 2017. PHMSA determined, however, that it would not issue enforcement citations to any operators for violations of provisions of the December 2016 Interim Final Rule that had previously been non-mandatory provisions of American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practices 1170 and 1171 until one year after PHMSA issued a final rule. The final rule related to underground gas storage facilities became effective as of March 13, 2020.
Following the October 2016 Interim Final Rule, PHMSA also published three final rules on pipeline safety applicable to the Company: "Enhanced Emergency Order Procedures;" "Safety of Gas Transmission Pipelines: Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure Reconfirmation, Expansion of Assessment Requirements, and Other Related Amendments" (also known as the Mega Rule Part 1); and "Safety of Gas Gathering Pipelines: Extension of Reporting Requirements, Regulation of Large, High-Pressure Lines, and Other Related Amendments" (also known as the Mega Rule Part 3). The Enhanced Emergency Order Procedures rule, which became effective on December 2, 2019, implements an existing statutory authorization for PHMSA to issue emergency orders related to pipeline safety if an unsafe condition or practice, or a combination of unsafe conditions and practices, constitutes, or is causing an imminent hazard. The Safety of Gas Transmissions Pipelines rule, which went into effect on July 1, 2020, requires operators of certain gas transmission pipelines that have been tested or that have inadequate records to determine the material strength of their lines by reconfirming the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure, and establishes a new Moderate Consequence Area for determining regulatory requirements for gas transmission pipeline segments outside of high consequence areas. The rule also establishes new requirements for conducting baseline assessments, incorporates into the regulations industry standards and guidelines regarding design, construction and in-line inspections, and new requirements for data integration and risk analysis in integrity management programs, including seismicity, manufacturing and construction defects, and crack and crack-like defects, and includes several requirements that allow operators to notify PHMSA of proposed alternative approaches to achieving the objectives of the minimum safety standards. The Safety of Gas Gathering Pipelines rule, which was finalized on November 15, 2021 and will go into effect on May 16, 2022, extends existing design, operational and maintenance, and reporting requirements to onshore natural gas gathering pipelines in rural areas. The rule requires operators of onshore gas gathering pipelines to report incidents and file annual reports, and creates new safety requirements that vary based on pipeline diameter and potential consequences of a failure. In 2021, the Company did not incur material compliance costs in connection with complying with the PHMSA rules applicable to the Company, and does not currently expect these rules to materially impact its future costs of operations and revenue from operations. However, the Company will continue to assess the impact of compliance with these rules on its future costs of operations and revenue from operations.
States are generally preempted by federal law in the area of pipeline safety, but state agencies may qualify to assume responsibility for enforcing federal regulations over intrastate pipelines. They may also promulgate additive pipeline safety regulations provided that the state standards are at least as stringent as the federal standards. Although many of the Company's natural gas facilities fall within a class that is not subject to integrity management requirements, the Company may incur significant costs and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventive or mitigation measures associated with its non-exempt transmission pipelines. The costs, if any, for repair, remediation, preventive or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, as well as lost cash flows resulting from shutting down the Company's pipelines during the pendency of any such actions, could be material to capital expenditures, earnings and the Company's competitive position.
Should the Company fail to comply with DOT regulations adopted under authority granted to PHMSA, it could be subject to penalties and fines. PHMSA has the statutory authority to impose civil penalties for pipeline safety violations up to a maximum of approximately $220,000 per day for each violation and approximately $2.2 million for a related series of violations. This maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. In addition, the Company could be required to make additional maintenance capital expenditures in the future for the above described or similar regulatory compliance initiatives that are not reflected in its forecasted maintenance capital expenditures. The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all existing federal, state and local pipeline safety laws and regulations. However, the adoption of new laws and regulations, such as those proposed by PHMSA, could result in significant 
added costs or delays to in service or the termination of projects, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company in the future.
On December 27, 2020, then-President Trump signed the "Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES Act) of 2020," which reauthorized the federal pipeline safety program that expired in 2019. The PIPES Act identifies areas where Congress believed additional oversight, research, or regulations was needed. The PIPES Act includes new mandates for PHMSA to require operators to update, as needed, their emergency response plans and operating and maintenance plans. The PIPES Act also requires operators to manage records and update, as necessary, their existing district regulator stations to eliminate a common mode of failure. PHMSA will also require that leak detection and repair programs consider the environment, the use of advance lead detection practices and technologies, and that operators be able to locate and categorize all leaks that are hazardous to human safety, the environment, or that can become hazardous. The Company has not incurred and does not anticipate incurring material capital expenditures in connection with complying with the PIPES Act.
Cybersecurity. The U.S. government has continued to issue public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyberattacks and, in May and July 2021, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Safety Administration (the TSA) issued security directives (as well as subsequent revisions thereto) applicable to certain midstream companies requiring such companies to comply with mandatory reporting measures and undertake a number of specific cybersecurity enhancements for both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems. The Company continues to work with the TSA to ensure compliance with the security directives and is implementing the requirements of those security directives, as needed. While such implementation is utilizing significant internal resources, implementation as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K has not materially adversely affected the Company's business and operations.
The regulatory environment surrounding cybersecurity continues to evolve in ways that are frequently difficult to predict. We have been required and may further be required to expend additional resources as a result of current or new laws, regulations, directives or other requirements, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement practices thereof, related to cybersecurity, which could result in material compliance costs. Any failure to remain in compliance with laws or regulations governing cybersecurity, including TSA security directives, may result in penalties, fines, enforcement actions, or mandated changes in our practices, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
For further information, see also "Cyberattacks aimed at us or third parties, as well as any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations governing cybersecurity and/or data privacy, could materially adversely affect us." under "Item 1A. Risk Factors." 
OSHA Regulation. On September 9, 2021, President Biden announced a proposed new rule requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees require that their employees be fully vaccinated or require unvaccinated workers to produce a negative test result at least once a week. On November 4, 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to carry out this mandate.
On January 13, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court granted an application to stay the ETS pending disposition of petitions for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Effective January 26, 2022, OSHA withdrew the ETS as an enforceable emergency temporary standard, but did not withdraw the ETS as a proposed rule.
Should the ETS, or similar state or local requirement, take effect in the future, the Company expects it would be subject to such regulation concerning COVID-19 vaccination or testing. In that case, the Company may be required to implement a requirement that many or most employees get vaccinated, subject to limited exceptions, or be tested, resulting in additional costs to the Company. At this time, it is not possible to predict the impact that a vaccine or testing requirement would have on the Company or its workforce. Any such mandate may result in increased costs, operational disruptions or employee attrition, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.
OSHA has also implemented a National Emphasis Program in July 2021 that focuses on COVID-19. This program channels the agency’s resources toward inspections of employers with congregate work settings, to ensure they maintain safety protocols designed to limit the spread of the coronavirus (e.g., masking, social distancing). This program is not likely to impact the Company’s remote workers, but could result in increased inspections and fines at the Company’s congregate work settings.
OSHA is also focusing on hazards posed to workers by extreme heat. The Biden Administration has indicated that it considers heat-related illnesses to be a growing hazard because of climate change, has identified this area of policy as a priority for the Administration because of its disproportionate impact on communities of color. To combat this hazard, on September 1, 2021, OSHA implemented an enforcement initiative prioritizing inspections of work activities when the heat index exceeds 80 degrees Fahrenheit. OSHA is also developing a National Emphasis Program for heat inspections and, on October 27, 2021, 
OSHA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on heat injury and illness prevention in outdoor and indoor work settings. This notice signals OSHA’s intent to issue a rule requiring employers to take certain precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses amongst their employees. As with OSHA’s COVID-19 enforcement initiatives, these programs will not likely impact the Company’s remote employees, but could result in increased inspections and fines at the Company’s outdoor worksites.
Employee Health and Safety. As noted above, the Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community "right-to-know" regulations and comparable state laws and regulations require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in the Company's operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. The Company is confident that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. 
Environmental Matters
General. The Company's operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may have the following effects on the Company:
•requiring that the Company obtains various permits to conduct regulated activities;
•requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise regulating the way the Company can handle or dispose of its wastes;
•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, water sources, or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; and
•requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate or eliminate pollution conditions caused by the Company's operations or attributable to former operations.
In addition, the Company's operations and construction activities may be subject to county and local ordinances that restrict the time, place or manner in which those operations and activities may be conducted.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements. Also, certain environmental statutes impose strict, and in some cases joint and several, liability for the cleanup and restoration of sites where hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released regardless of the fault of the current site owner or operator. Consequently, the Company may be subject to environmental liability at its currently owned or operated facilities for conditions caused by others prior to the Company's involvement.
The Company has implemented programs and policies designed to keep its pipelines and other facilities in compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, and the Company does not believe that the cost of its compliance with such legal requirements will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to its shareholders. Nonetheless, the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and it is generally expected that such trend will likely increase under the Biden Administration. Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be significantly in excess of the amounts the Company currently anticipates. For example, the Biden Administration has announced that it will be reviewing the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and may make these standards more stringent. This could result in the areas in which the Company operates being designated as nonattainment areas. States that contain any areas designated as nonattainment areas will be required to develop implementation plans demonstrating how the areas will attain the applicable standard within a prescribed period of time. These plans may require the installation of additional equipment to control emissions. The EPA did not make the ozone NAAQS more stringent when it reviewed them in 2020, but the Biden Administration has indicated that it will reconsider that decision. In addition, in November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would make more stringent the volatile organic compound (VOC) and methane emissions limits on certain new and modified equipment in the oil and gas source category, including certain types of compressors and pneumatic pumps. The proposed rule would also extend these requirements to existing sources for the first time. Some states are also enacting methane reduction programs. For example, Pennsylvania has a methane reduction framework for the oil and gas industry that will result in an existing source VOC regulation with the stated goal of reducing methane emissions from well sites, compressor stations and pipelines.
Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of the Company's equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase the Company's capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely affect the Company's business. The Company continuously attempts to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and works to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. While the Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, there is no assurance that the current conditions will continue in the future.
Additionally, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order on "Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis," under which President Biden directed the heads of all federal agencies to review "all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and any other similar agency actions (agency actions) promulgated, issued, or adopted" during the Trump Administration for consistency with the policies established in the Biden Administration order. Regulatory actions resulting from this review could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations, including by requiring additional capital expenditures and increasing operating costs.
The following is a discussion of several of the material environmental laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, that relate to the Company's business.
Hazardous Substances and Waste. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and companies that transported, disposed or arranged for the transportation or disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these "responsible persons" may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. The Company generates materials in the course of its ordinary operations that are regulated as "hazardous substances" under CERCLA or similar state laws and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA, or such laws, for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
In the ordinary course of the Company's operations, the Company generates wastes constituting solid wastes, and in some instances hazardous wastes, which are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and comparable state statutes. While the RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. While certain petroleum production wastes are excluded from RCRA's hazardous waste regulations, it is possible that these wastes will in the future be designated as "hazardous wastes" and be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses.
The Company owns, leases or operates properties where petroleum hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. The Company has generally utilized operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry at the time, although petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned, leased or operated by the Company, or on or under the other locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. Petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released on certain of these properties by third parties that previously operated, owned or leased these properties and whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes were not under the Company's control. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, the Company could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.
Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including the Company's compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that the Company obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. The Company's failure to comply with these requirements could subject it to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. The Company may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining permits and approvals for air emissions. These types of capital 
expenditures could also be required in areas that are nonattainment for the ozone national ambient air quality standards depending on the design of the relevant state’s implementation plan to meet the air quality standards. Future compliance with these requirements may require modifications to certain of the Company's operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from the Company's compressors, that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely affect the Company's business.
Climate Change. The Company has announced a goal of becoming net zero for carbon by 2050. The Company’s climate policy includes two interim emission reduction targets: (i) a 50 percent reduction of its Scope 1 and Scope 2 methane emissions by 2030; and (ii) a 50 percent reduction of its total Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040.
Legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and GHG emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation and will be a major focus of the Biden Administration. On January 27, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order on "Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad." This executive order contains sweeping direction to the executive branch to address climate issues. Among other things, the order put a "pause" on any new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a review by the Department of the Interior. A district court issued an injunction halting the leasing pause, but the Biden Administration is appealing that decision. Under the executive order, the Interior Department issued a report in November 2021 in response to this executive order that recommends increasing the oil and gas royalties associated with fossil fuels extracted from public lands and offshore waters.
The EPA regulates GHG emissions from new and modified facilities that are potential major sources of criteria pollutants under the Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs and has adopted regulations that require, among other things, preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources and the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from certain onshore oil and natural gas production sources on an annual basis.
The EPA regulates methane and VOCs from the oil and gas sector through its new source performance standard program under the Clean Air Act. In May 2016, the EPA finalized rules (Subpart OOOOa) that impose methane and VOC emissions limits on certain types of new and modified compressors and pneumatic pumps. The EPA finalized amendments to some requirements in these standards in March 2018, September 2018 and September 2020, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements such as fugitive emissions monitoring frequency. In September 2020, the EPA issued a final rule (known as the Policy Rule) that "corrected" the regulations by removing the transmission and storage segments from the source category subject to the rule and removing the methane emissions limits from the rule. Congress revoked the Policy Rule through the Congressional Review Act, and President Biden signed this into law in June 2021. The Congressional Review Act action has the effect as though the Policy Rule never existed. The revocation of the Policy Rule did not affect Equitrans Midstream because the Company never stopped complying with the Subpart OOOOa methane and VOC emissions limits. In November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule that proposes to do three things: (i) modify Subpart OOOOa to, among other things, increase fugitive emissions monitoring frequency; (ii) promulgate a new Subpart OOOOb that would impose more stringent requirements on new and modified oil and gas sources; and (iii) promulgate an emissions guideline (a new Subpart OOOOc) that would provide direction to the states to regulate VOC and methane emissions from existing sources in the sector for the first time. The proposed Subpart OOOOc would largely regulate existing sources in the same manner in which new and modified sources are regulated. If the proposed rule is finalized, the Company will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment, increased fugitive emissions monitoring, and other requirements that could result in significant costs and could adversely affect the Company's business.
In addition, in 2015, the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the U.S. in April 2016, requires countries to review and "represent a progression" in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set GHG emission reduction goals) every five years beginning in 2020. The United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement in 2020; however, President Biden signed an executive order on January 20, 2021, for the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement. The United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2021 and was one of the countries entering into a Global Methane Pledge. One of the key pieces of the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan that was announced is the EPA’s proposed methane rules for the oil and gas sector. In April 2021, the United States announced its commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Depending on how this reduction is to be achieved, the Company could be required to reduce its GHG emissions, which would increase the Company’s cost of environmental compliance.
The U.S. Congress, along with federal and state agencies, has considered measures to reduce the emissions of GHGs. Legislation or regulation that imposes a carbon tax on carbon emissions or that restricts those emissions could increase the Company's cost of environmental compliance through the Company's incurrence of increased non-income taxes or by requiring 
the Company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities and/or, depending on any future legislation, purchase emission allowances. The effect of climate change legislation or regulation on the Company's business is currently uncertain. If the Company incurs additional costs to comply with such legislation or regulations, it may not be able to pass on the higher costs to its customers or recover all the costs related to complying with such requirements and any such recovery may depend on events beyond the Company's control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC or state regulatory agencies and the provisions of any final legislation or implementing regulations. The Company's future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be adversely affected if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates or otherwise passed on to its customers. Additionally, the Company's producer customers may also be affected by legislation or regulation, which may, directly or indirectly, adversely impact their ability and willingness to produce natural gas and accordingly affect such producers' financial health or reduce the volumes delivered to the Company and demand for its services. Climate change and GHG legislation or regulation could delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain and maintain permits and other regulatory approvals for existing and new facilities, impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements or adversely affect demand for the natural gas the Company gathers, transports and stores. The effect on the Company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted.

Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Water Discharges. The federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants or dredged and fill material into state waters as well as waters of the United States, including adjacent wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of permits issued by the EPA, the Army Corps or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, new EPA and Army Corps rules defining the scope of the EPA's and the Army Corps' jurisdiction became effective (the 2015 Clean Water Rule), however, the 2015 Clean Water Rule was promptly challenged in courts and was enjoined by judicial action in some states. Further, in October 2019 the EPA issued a rule repealing the 2015 Clean Water Rule and recodifying the preexisting regulations. In June 2020, new EPA and Army Corps regulations narrowing the regulatory scope of the Clean Water Act became effective (the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule). Like the 2015 Clean Water Rule, the 2020 Navigable Water Protection Rule was promptly challenged in courts and has been enjoined by judicial action in at least one state. On December 7, 2021, EPA and the Army Corps published a proposed rule that would reinstate the pre-2015 definition of waters of the United States, updated to reflect recent Supreme Court decisions. To the extent that any future rules expand the scope of the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction, the Company could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for activities in jurisdictional waters, including wetlands.
Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws. The Company believes that compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.
National Environmental Policy Act. The construction of interstate natural gas transportation pipelines pursuant to the NGA requires authorization from the FERC. The FERC actions are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires federal agencies, such as the FERC, to evaluate major federal actions having the potential to significantly affect the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will either prepare an environmental assessment that examines the potential direct, indirect and cumulative effects of a proposed project or, if necessary, a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement. Any proposed plans for future construction activities that require FERC authorization will be subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to significantly delay or limit, and significantly increase the cost of, development of midstream infrastructure. In September 2020, new Council on Environmental Quality regulations intended to streamline the NEPA evaluation process went into effect. These rules have been challenged in courts, although initial efforts to enjoin enforcement of the rule were unsuccessful.
Endangered Species Act. The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) restricts activities that may adversely affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. Federal agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitat. While some of the Company's facilities are located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, the Company is confident that it is in substantial compliance with the ESA. The designation of previously unprotected species as being 
endangered or threatened, or the designation of previously unprotected areas as a critical habitat for such species, has caused and could in the future cause the Company to incur additional costs, resulted in and could in the future result in delays in construction of pipelines and facilities, or cause the Company to become subject to operating restrictions in areas where the species are known to exist. For example, the FWS continues to receive hundreds of petitions to consider listing additional species as endangered or threatened and is being regularly sued or threatened with lawsuits to address these petitions. Some of these legal actions may result in the listing of species located in areas in which the Company operates. Throughout 2020, the United States Department of Interior narrowed the ESA regulations and their applicability. These regulations have been challenged in the courts.
Environmental Justice. The federal government has made advancing environmental justice a priority and has announced a number of new initiatives in the area. Some of those initiatives could have impacts on the business of oil and gas companies, although the ultimate form of the federal government’s approach to these issues is unknown and the impact to the oil and gas industry remains uncertain. The Biden Administration announced a renewed commitment to environmental justice in its day one executive order on climate change and the environment and followed up that action with an executive order establishing new environmental justice advisory committees tasked with helping the government devise new environmental justice policies. Since that time, the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Committee has released recommendations that include new spending priorities, development of environmental justice impact assessment techniques, and legal enforcement recommendations. The Department of Justice and the EPA Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance have issued policy statements indicating that both agencies will seek to enhance prosecution of environmental justice crimes and to seek out ways to address environmental justice through the legal system. EPA has also issued a number of statements indicating that it will attempt to address environmental justice issues more substantially through its policy making. It is unclear how these new policies will be implemented, and Equitrans Midstream will continue to monitor new developments and assess whether and how they may affect the Company.
States are also in the process of reexamining environmental justice law and policy. Pennsylvania’s governor signed an executive order in October 2021 creating an Office of Environmental Justice within the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. It is tasked with revising Pennsylvania’s environmental justice policies and examining ways to advance environmental justice issues. In Virginia, the legislature enacted the Environmental Justice Act of 2020, which requires state agencies to examine the environmental justice impacts of their actions and creates a council to recommend new environmental justice policies. Ohio and West Virginia appear to be monitoring developments at the EPA. Many of the key issues before the states appear to be focused on enhancing public participation in permitting and other project development-related decisions. State agencies also appear to be considering new approaches to environmental justice in permitting decisions, potentially denying permits or other authorizations on environmental justice grounds. Equitrans Midstream will continue to monitor state legal and regulatory developments in this area and respond as appropriate.
The majority of environmental justice litigation matters appear to be focused on whether state or federal agencies with permitting or other decision-making responsibility have adequately considered environmental justice issues during the decision-making process. Many advocacy organizations purport to raise environmental justice issues in connection with permitting legal challenges. Equitrans Midstream will continue to monitor these litigation-related developments.
Equitrans Midstream has a number of policies in place that address environmental justice issues. One of the Company’s pillars of sustainability is stakeholder engagement, including engagement with the communities where Equitrans Midstream operates. In 2021, Equitrans Midstream published its Stakeholder Engagement and Community Investment Policy, which emphasizes early and consistent community engagement throughout project development and operation, and it specifically prioritizes environmental justice and environmental stewardship. The Company has also adopted a Human Rights Policy committing the Company to safeguarding dignity and respect for all people throughout the Company’s value chain, including through community engagement and the prevention of discrimination. 
Equitrans Midstream is in the process of developing a comprehensive environmental justice policy. The Company will continue that work, mindful of new developments at the federal, state, and local levels.
Seasonality
Weather affects natural gas demand for power generation and heating purposes. Peak demand for natural gas typically occurs during the winter months as a result of the heating load.
