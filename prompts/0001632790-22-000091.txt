Our Industry
We are a branded manufacturing and distribution company that markets and sells in the battery, auto care and portable lights categories. These categories are highly competitive, both in the U.S. and on a global basis. We invest in our brands and innovation to meet the needs of consumers, and with our large global footprint, we both manufacture and source our products. Competition within our categories is based upon brand perceptions, product performance, price, retail execution and customer service. Key drivers of the battery business are device usage, consumer demographics and disasters and key drivers for the auto care business are size and age of car parc and miles driven. Competition in this category remains aggressive in the U.S. and other markets and could continue to put additional pressure on our results going forward, particularly as consumers shift consumption between channels such as e-commerce and discounters.
Sales and Distribution
We distribute our products to consumers through numerous retail locations worldwide, including mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, food, drug and convenience stores, electronics specialty stores and department stores, hardware and automotive centers, e-commerce and military stores. Although a large percentage of our sales are attributable to a relatively small number of retail customers, in fiscal year 2022, only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for ten percent or more (12.9%) of the Company's annual sales. 
Our products are marketed primarily through a direct sales force, but also through exclusive and non-exclusive distributors and wholesalers. Our products are sold through both “modern” and “traditional” trade. “Modern” trade, which is most prevalent in North America, Western Europe, and more developed economies throughout the world, generally refers to sales through large retailers with nationally or regionally recognized brands. “Traditional” trade, which is more common in developing markets in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, generally refers to sales by wholesalers or small retailers who may not have a national or regional presence.

Additional information can be found in the MD&A and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Revenue, of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used by Energizer in the production of batteries and lighting products include electrolytic manganese dioxide, zinc, silver, nickel, lithium, graphite, steel, plastic, brass wire, and potassium hydroxide. The principal raw material used by auto care is refrigerant R-134a, plastic, silicone, steel and aluminum. The prices and availability of these raw materials have fluctuated over time. We believe that adequate supplies of most raw materials and component parts required for all of our operations are available at the present time, although we cannot predict their future availability or prices. Our raw materials and component parts are generally available from a number of different sources, and are susceptible to currency fluctuations and price fluctuations due to supply and demand, transportation, government regulations, price controls, tariffs, economic climate, or other unforeseen circumstances like force majeure. We have not experienced any significant interruption in availability of raw materials as our supply chain begins to normalize. We continue to work to qualify additional sources to ensure continuity and resiliency of supply for these items. We believe we have extensive experience in purchasing raw materials in the commodity markets. From time to time, our management has purchased materials or entered into forward commitments for raw materials to assure supply and to protect margins on anticipated sales volume.
Our Trademarks, Patents and Technology
Our ability to compete effectively in the battery, auto care and portable lights categories depends, in part, on our ability to protect our brands and maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and manufacturing processes through a combination of trademark, patent and trade secret protection. We own thousands of Energizer, Rayovac, and Eveready trademarks globally, and license Varta trademarks, which we consider to be of substantial importance and which are used individually or in conjunction with other sub-brand names. The number of Energizer, Rayovac, Eveready, Energizer Bunny, and Mr. Energizer trademarks, including related designs, slogans and sub-brands, is currently over 2,800 worldwide.
In our auto care business, we also have the Refresh Your Car!, California Scents, Driven, Bahama & Co., LEXOL, Eagle One, Armor All, STP, Tuff Stuff, Kent Car Care, A/C Pro and the Nu Finish trademarks, and we recently expanded our portfolio in Latin America to add the Carnu, Grand Prix, Kit and Tempo trademarks. The number of trademarks making up the total of the auto care trademark portfolio globally, including related designs, slogans, and sub-brands, is nearly over 1,900 worldwide.
We also own a number of patents, patent applications and other technology that relate primarily to battery, automotive fragrance, performance and appearance products and portable lights, which we believe are significant to our business.
Seasonality
Sales and operating profit for our business tends to be seasonal, with increased purchases by consumers and increases in retailer inventories occurring for batteries during our fiscal first quarter and for automotive fragrance, appearance, performance and air conditioning recharge products during our fiscal second and third quarters. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes can create conditions that drive short-term increases in the need for portable power and lighting products and thereby increase our battery and flashlight sales. As a result of this seasonality, our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate throughout the year. 
Human Capital Resources
Purpose and Values
Energizer is led by our purpose to responsibly create products that make lives easier and more enjoyable. 
Launched in fiscal 2022, Energizer 2.0 is a new vision for powering our future. It reflects a commitment to growing as both a business and a global corporate citizen. Our values are the foundation for everything we do and are essential to fulfilling our mission of being the leader in our categories by better serving consumers and customers: 
•We Win Together. We relentlessly pursue our goals. We celebrate and move to the next challenge. We act with urgency because windows of opportunity close quickly. We are focused on results.
•While Serving Each Other. We care for others’ success as much as we do our own. We challenge respectfully to drive better outcomes and work collectively across functions, levels and geographies to achieve our goals. All for one, one for all. 
•With A Willingness to Act Boldly. We push forward rather than leaning back. We take chances, have a bias for action and go all in to achieve our goals. Even if we fail, we fail together. We are transparent, we learn from it, and are better for it. We are fearlessly determined. 
•All While Doing Right. We bring out the best in each other to bring the best to our consumers and customers. We are vulnerable and trust each other with our imperfections. By being inclusive and open, our diverse perspectives amplify what we can achieve. Doing the right thing is all we know. 
Employees
As of September 30, 2022, we have approximately 5,500 employees located across 36 countries, including approximately 2,200 employees based in North America, 1,800 employees in Asia Pacific, 900 employees in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and 600 employees in Latin America. Approximately 440 employees are unionized, primarily at our Fennimore, Wisconsin; Portage, Wisconsin; and Marietta, Ohio, facilities. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Governance
Energizer believes that strong governance principles, policies and practices contribute to better results for our shareholders. We are proud to have a diverse and independent board of directors with the skills, experience and perspectives to help chart the course of our global company. 
The Human Capital Committee oversees company policies and practices related to human capital management, including those related to our culture, diversity and inclusion efforts, and rewards and compensation programs. Under the leadership of our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Human Capital Officer is responsible for developing and executing key aspects of our human capital strategy, including the attraction, development, retention, and engagement of talent to deliver on the Company’s strategy and the design of competitive compensation and employee benefit programs.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging 
At Energizer, diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (“DEIB”) is a business imperative that requires active engagement from all of our leaders and colleagues. We strive to foster an inclusive and diverse workplace culture where colleagues feel a sense of belonging, feel listened to, are included in discussions and are valued for their contributions. 
In fiscal 2022, Energizer appointed a Global Director of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging, who is leading and advancing our global DEIB efforts. This year, we focused on the following strategic priorities:
•Community: Promoting a workplace where all colleagues feel safe to express their perspectives and feel they belong to our Energizer team; 
•Learning: Building colleague awareness and understanding to produce respectful and inclusive workplace behaviors and actions; and
•Talent: Embracing diversity to attract, recruit, develop and retain top talent. 
Our recruitment strategies are designed to ensure a diverse pipeline of candidates to meet the needs of our business today and in the future. Energizer has taken steps to enhance its talent acquisition process across the organization, including by implementing diversity training for recruiters, interview skills training for colleagues and processes to improve our candidate attraction, selection and onboarding so we can welcome diverse colleagues to our company. We continually assess our talent guidelines and decisions to ensure fair and objective hiring practices. 
In fiscal 2022, our Global DEIB Council, which is sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Capital Officer, continued to provide strategic oversight of, and facilitate business alignment with, Energizer’s DEIB activities. Energizer has offered a series of diversity and inclusion-related trainings including Inclusive Mindset for Committed Allies and Unconscious Bias. Completion rates for the Inclusive Mindset for Committed Allies training program was over 95% for salaried colleagues. In fiscal 2022, we also continued to publish stories written in partnership with our diverse colleagues, who shared their experiences with our organization to help build our internal community and appreciate our differences. Looking into the future, we are developing a comprehensive DEIB learning plan, with training topics that align with our desired workplace culture, for all colleague levels. 
Energizer is proud to have three employee resource groups—the Women’s Leadership Network (WLN), the African Ancestry Leadership Group, and Mosaic (the Asian-American Ancestry Group)—that help increase visibility and advancement of diverse colleagues. By embracing our colleagues’ diverse cultures, experiences and ways of thinking, we believe that we will deliver better business results and have a more engaged workforce.
Results-Driven, Collaborative Culture
Energizer colleagues are dedicated to working together to win. We learn together, care about each other and do the right thing to achieve our goals. We strive to build a culture that will propel our business forward and create a vibrant future for our brands, products, customers, consumers, shareholders, and colleagues. Our culture champion network, with 70 members across our business, leads local and global efforts to create inclusive work environments. Through virtual meetings and global events, we strive to bring our colleagues together to help create a sense of community and belonging across our locations worldwide.
From town halls and leadership forums to engagement surveys conducted through a third-party partner we seek out colleague feedback and take action to improve our culture and the employee experience. Our fiscal 2022 engagement score was 76 with an 80% global colleague response rate, both of which exceeded the global benchmarks from our third-party survey provider. We have taken strides to improve our awareness of what drives engagement and the role each colleague plays in improving engagement. We do this by providing and sharing online learning resources through the engagement platform for teams to leverage as they review their results and develop their action plans.
We are committed to colleague recognition, which includes acknowledging, appreciating and celebrating each other’s contributions and achievements. In fiscal 2022 Energizer launched a new global recognition platform called Celebrate that allows us to honor colleagues’ service anniversaries and other special events. Celebrate also serves as an improved platform for our CEO Award, which rewards and recognizes both teams and individual colleagues who have made significant and notable contributions to Energizer’s success.
Talent Development
Engaged, driven and productive colleagues are essential to achieving growth. All colleagues participate in annual training focused on topics related to ethics, compliance, inclusion, belonging and diversity. For salaried colleagues, we offer a catalog featuring in excess of 2,000 online courses from IT skills to business acumen and leadership skills, along with an online competency model library and supporting training resources. Specific skills-based training is provided to colleagues within their function, to ensure they understand and master necessary job skills and requirements and have access to developmental opportunities. We also encourage career development through individual development planning, formal mentoring programs, team effectiveness workshops, project and change management training and leadership development programs. For hourly colleagues, we conduct annual safety, health and environmental training as well as equipment and other job-relevant training. Colleagues are encouraged to communicate their career interests to their manager and have access to our career center to view available positions.
Pay
Our primary compensation strategy is to “pay for performance” on both a long-term and annual basis, which helps drive a mindset of accountability and productivity and aligns the interests of our colleagues with our shareholders. Our compensation guiding principles are to structure compensation that is simple, aligned and balanced. We believe our compensation guiding principles are strongly aligned with our corporate strategic priorities and our vision for shareholder value creation.
We deliver market-competitive total rewards packages for our colleagues. As part of our commitment to fair pay, we strive to be externally competitive while keeping in mind internal equity across our organization. Pay for performance is our fundamental reward philosophy. We reward and recognize both individual and team results relative to our business goals and commitment to shareholders, as well as behaviors that align with our culture statement. We are committed to fair pay and strive to be externally competitive while ensuring internal equity across our organization. We conduct global pay equity assessments and compensation reviews. We strive to reduce unconscious biases and structural barriers in our hiring practices, performance reviews, promotional guidelines and leadership opportunities that may contribute to pay inequities.
Workplace Safety
Energizer maintains a global safety, health and environmental (“SHE”) policy designed to help ensure a safe workplace for our colleagues. Because providing products and services to our customers with zero harm to people and the environment is our goal, we require all colleagues and contractors at our plants and manufacturing facilities to understand and follow our global SHE policy, and we retrain them on this policy on an annual basis. Each facility also maintains additional safety policies, measures and procedures specific to its individual needs. Our occupational health and safety management system is aimed at addressing three key components of safety: 
•Identifying the root cause of safety hazards in our operations; 
•Assessing risks associated with all hazards or conditions identified; and 
•Mitigating risks associated with known hazards and conditions. 
The program establishes minimum requirements for enterprise-wide safety, environmental and Department of Transportation loss-prevention activities, and contributes to our compliance with applicable safety and environmental-related laws, rules and regulations.
Health and Well-being
Creating a culture where all colleagues feel supported and valued is paramount to our corporate mission. Our well-being goals are for colleagues to physically thrive, flourish mentally and emotionally, be socially connected and achieve financial security. Energizer is proud to provide 100% of our colleagues with access to an employee assistance plan (“EAP”). Energizer’s EAP offers colleagues and their eligible dependents counseling and well-being resources, 24 hours a day, seven days a week by phone, online or via the mobile site. 
We provide ongoing communications and tools to continue meeting our colleagues’ needs, including a well-being program. In addition to the social benefits offered in different countries, we also offer market-competitive core benefit plans in 
most of the countries where we operate that are designed to support our colleagues’ overall well-being. Well-being is more important now than ever, and our colleagues value holistic resources to help them balance work and home demands. 
We utilize our flexible working guidelines to allow colleagues and their managers to establish flexible work arrangements that address when, where and how their work gets done. Enabling a flexible workplace removes barriers that may prohibit success and better addresses our colleagues’ different work and life needs.
Community
Energizer believes in supporting the communities where we live, work and play. Many of our colleagues are highly active with charities of their own choosing, and the Energizer Giving Foundation enables them to make a greater difference by matching their contributions dollar-for-dollar. Energizer also supports Feed the Children and disaster relief efforts through our partnership with Red Cross.
Since 2016, Energizer has donated more than 15 million batteries and portable lighting products in North America alone. The World Health Organization celebrates World Hearing Day every March to raise awareness of hearing loss, encourage individuals to recognize the signs of hearing loss in themselves or loved ones and advocate for audiology checkups. In support of this effort, Rayovac promotes an online hub of information and articles for consumers to raise awareness of the seriousness and importance of hearing loss, and help people to recognize their own hearing loss, or recognize the symptoms in a loved one – prompting them to get a checkup.
Relevant Company Policies
Energizer Holdings’ policies in support of the topics discussed in this section, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, Social Policy (Human Rights and Labor Rights), and Safety, Health and Environmental Policy, can be found in the Policies section of the Energizer Holdings, Inc. website.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
Our operations, including the manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, advertising and sale of our products, are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those intended to protect public health and the environment. In the U.S. many of our products are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and by the Federal Trade Commission with respect to advertising. Similar regulations have been adopted by authorities in foreign countries where we sell our products, and by state and local authorities in the U.S. We are also subject to extended producer responsibility (EPR) fees regarding the recycling of batteries and packaging; regulations regarding transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment; and regulations in other related areas, such as sustainability, including the European Union Batteries Regulation Directive and updates to EU REACH and Classification, Labeling, and Packaging (CLP) laws. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, foreign, state and local governmental authorities.
In recent years, refrigerants such as R-134a, which is a critical component of our auto care business’ aftermarket A/C products, have become the subject of regulatory focus due to their potential to contribute to global warming. The EU has passed regulations that essentially phased out of R-134a in automotive cooling systems in new vehicles by 2017. Canada has also implemented similar regulations, phasing into effect beginning in 2021. The United States passed the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM Act) in 2020, which also regulates refrigerants, and individual states are also regulating the sale and distribution of products containing R-134a. In addition, regulations may also be enacted governing the packing, use and disposal of our auto care business' products containing refrigerants. 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions and requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized. We are also subject to similar or even more restrictive anti-corruption laws imposed by the governments of other countries where we do business, including the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and the Brazil Clean Company Act. We make sales and operate in countries known to experience corruption that are rated as high-risk nations. Our business activities in such countries create the risk of unauthorized conduct by one or more of our employees, customs brokers, freight forwarders, or distributors that could be in violation of various laws including the FCPA or similar local regulations.
Our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the U.S. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. In many 
jurisdictions, compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us, and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities, due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.
The Company is also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. Such privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the European Union's GDPR, the Brazilian Data Protection Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance.
We also must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, recycling of batteries and packaging, the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances, chemicals in products and product safety. We are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of our current and former manufacturing facilities. In addition, some of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and, over that time, some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may now be considered hazardous. It is possible that those sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom we have sent waste, may be identified and become the subject of remediation. We could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future, whether as a result of new laws and regulations or otherwise, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
For additional information on the laws and regulations that apply to our business, see MD&A and Note 22, Environmental and Regulatory, to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of the risks associated with these laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors."
