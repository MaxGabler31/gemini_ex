ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Overview
Our business consists primarily of the electric transmission operations of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries. ITC Holdings was incorporated in the State of Michigan in 2002. Through our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, we own and operate high-voltage systems in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula and portions of Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma that transmit electricity from generating stations to local distribution facilities connected to our systems. Our business strategy is to own, operate, maintain and invest in transmission infrastructure in order to enhance system integrity and reliability, reduce transmission constraints and support new generating resources to interconnect to our transmission systems. We also are pursuing development projects outside our existing systems.
As electric transmission utilities with rates regulated by the FERC, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries earn revenues for the use of their electric transmission systems by our customers, which include investor-owned utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, power marketers and alternative energy suppliers. As independent transmission companies, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are subject to rate regulation only by the FERC, and our cost-based rates are discussed in “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cost-Based Formula Rates with True-Up Mechanism.”
The Merger 
On February 9, 2016, ITC Holdings entered into the Merger Agreement with Fortis, FortisUS and Merger Sub. On April 20, 2016, Fortis reached a definitive agreement with GIC for GIC to acquire an indirect 19.9% equity interest in ITC Holdings upon completion of the Merger. On October 14, 2016, ITC Holdings and Fortis completed the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement. On the same date, the common shares of ITC Holdings were delisted from the NYSE. Due to the delisting of ITC Holdings common shares, there is limited share data, and no per share data, presented in this Form 10-K. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the Merger. 
Development of Business
We are actively identifying and investing in transmission infrastructure required to meet reliability needs and energy policy objectives. Our long-term growth plan includes ongoing investments in our current regulated transmission systems and the identification of incremental development projects throughout North America. Refer to “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Investment and Operating Results Trends” for additional details about our long-term capital investments. Refer to the discussion of risks associated with our strategic development opportunities in “Item 1A Risk Factors.”
We expect to invest approximately $3.5 billion from 2019 through 2023 at our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries. Included in this amount are capital expenditures to: (1) maintain and replace the current transmission infrastructure; (2) enhance system integrity and reliability and accommodate load growth; (3) upgrade physical and technological grid security and (4) develop and build regional transmission infrastructure, including additional transmission facilities that will provide interconnection opportunities for generating facilities.
Through our development activities, we pursue projects in North America that are in line with our business strategy, enhance competitive wholesale electricity markets and facilitate interconnections of new generating resources, including wind generation and other renewable resources necessary to achieve state and federal policy goals. We are also actively pursuing energy storage and contracted transmission projects.
Operations
As transmission-only companies, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries function as conduits, allowing for power from generators to be transmitted to local distribution systems either entirely through their own systems or in conjunction with neighboring transmission systems. Third parties then transmit power through these local distribution systems to end-use consumers. The transmission of electricity by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries is a central function to the provision of electricity to residential, commercial and industrial end-use consumers. The operations performed by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries fall into the following categories:

• | asset planning;

7


• | engineering, design and construction;


• | asset protection and performance


• | maintenance; and


• | real time operations.

Asset Planning
The Asset Planning group uses detailed system models and load forecasts to develop our system expansion capital plans. Expansion capital plans identify projects that would address potential future reliability issues and/or produce economic savings for customers by eliminating constraints. 
The Asset Planning group works closely with MISO and SPP in the development of our system expansion capital plans by performing technical evaluations and detailed studies. As the regional planning authorities, MISO and SPP approve regional system improvement plans, which include projects to be constructed by their members, including our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and ITC Great Plains.
Engineering, Design and Construction
The Engineering, Design and Construction group is responsible for design, equipment specifications, maintenance plans and project engineering for capital, operation and maintenance work. We work with outside contractors to perform various aspects of our engineering, design and construction, but retain internal technical experts who have experience with respect to the key elements of the transmission system such as substations, lines, equipment and protective relaying systems.
Asset Protection and Performance
The Asset Protection and Performance group is responsible for safety, human performance, security, and emergency preparedness and response. Given the inherent hazardous nature of the utilities industry, we proactively work to ensure that all personnel are free to perform in a safe and secure environment. Our focus is not to compromise the safety of our employees, contractors or the public in the course of providing the most reliable electricity transmission services. 
Due to the growing trend in the theft of data, the security of hard assets including laptops, mechanical keys, badges, etc. is critical. We have established guidelines to help maintain the security of company assets and regularly monitor potential security threats. Separate from the Asset Protection and Performance group, we have a Cyber Security group that develops, refines and monitors a comprehensive and complex cyber security system to protect our infrastructure.
Maintenance
We develop and track preventive maintenance plans to promote safe and reliable systems. By performing preventive maintenance on our assets, we can minimize the need for reactive maintenance, resulting in improved reliability. Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries contract with ULCS, which is a division of Asplundh Tree Expert Co., to perform the majority of their maintenance. The agreement with ULCS provides us with access to an experienced and scalable workforce with knowledge of our system at an established rate. 
Real Time Operations
System Operations — From our operations facility in Novi, Michigan, transmission system operators continuously monitor the performance of the transmission systems of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, using software and communication systems to perform analysis to plan for contingencies and maintain security and reliability following any unplanned events on the system. Transmission system operators are also responsible for the switching and protective tagging function, taking equipment in and out of service to ensure capital construction projects and maintenance programs can be completed safely and reliably. 
Local Balancing Authority Operator — Under the functional control of MISO, ITCTransmission and METC operate their electric transmission systems as a combined LBA area, known as MECS. From our operations facility in Novi, Michigan, our employees perform the LBA functions as outlined in MISO’s Balancing Authority Agreement. These functions include actual interchange data administration and verification as well as MECS LBA area emergency procedure implementation and coordination. Besides ITCTransmission and METC, our other Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are not responsible for LBA functions for their respective assets.

The CIA governs the rights, obligations and responsibilities of ITCTransmission and DTE Electric regarding, among other things, the operation and interconnection of DTE Electric’s distribution system and ITCTransmission’s transmission system, and the construction of new facilities or modification of existing facilities. Additionally, the CIA allocates costs for operation of supervisory, communications and metering equipment. 
METC
Consumers Energy operates the electric distribution system to which METC’s transmission system connects. METC is a party to a number of operating contracts with Consumers Energy that govern the operations and maintenance of its transmission system. These contracts include the following:
Amended and Restated Easement Agreement. Under the Easement Agreement, Consumers Energy provides METC with an easement to the land on which a majority of METC’s transmission towers, poles, lines and other transmission facilities used to transmit electricity for Consumers Energy and others are located. METC pays Consumers Energy an annual rent for the easement and also pays for any rentals, property taxes and other fees related to the property covered by the Easement Agreement.
Amended and Restated Operating Agreement. Under the Operating Agreement, METC is responsible for maintaining and operating its transmission system, providing Consumers Energy with information and access to its transmission system and related books and records, administering and performing the duties of control area operator (that is, the entity exercising operational control over the transmission system) and, if requested by Consumers Energy, building connection facilities necessary to permit interaction with new distribution facilities built by Consumers Energy. 
Amended and Restated Purchase and Sale Agreement for Ancillary Services. Since METC does not own any generating facilities, it must procure ancillary services from third party suppliers, such as Consumers Energy. Currently, under the Ancillary Services Agreement, METC pays Consumers Energy for providing certain generation-based services necessary to support the reliable operation of the bulk power grid, such as voltage support and generation capability and capacity to balance loads and generation.
Amended and Restated Distribution-Transmission Interconnection Agreement.

ITC Midwest, IP&L and MISO entered into the LGIA in order to establish, re-establish and maintain the direct electricity interconnection of IP&L’s electricity generating assets with ITC Midwest’s transmission system for the purposes of transmitting electric power from and to the electricity generating facilities.
Operations Services Agreement For 34.5 kV Transmission Facilities. ITC Midwest and IP&L entered into the OSA under which IP&L performs certain operations functions for ITC Midwest’s 34.5 kV transmission system on behalf of ITC Midwest. The OSA provides that when ITC Midwest upgrades 34.5 kV facilities to higher operating voltages it may notify IP&L of the change and the OSA is no longer applicable to those facilities.
ITC Great Plains
Amended and Restated Maintenance Agreement. Mid-Kansas and ITC Great Plains have entered into the Mid-Kansas Agreement pursuant to which Mid-Kansas has agreed to perform various field operations and maintenance services related to certain ITC Great Plains assets.
ITC Interconnection
ITC Interconnection pursues transmission investment opportunities and acquired certain transmission assets from a merchant generating company and placed a 345kV transmission line in service. As a result, ITC Interconnection is a transmission owner in PJM Interconnection, a FERC-approved RTO, and is subject to rate regulation by the FERC. The revenues earned by ITC Interconnection are based on its facilities reimbursement agreement with the merchant generating company.
Regulatory Environment
Many regulators and public policy makers support the need for further investment in the transmission grid. The growth and changing mix of electricity generation, wholesale power sales and consumption combined with historically inadequate transmission investment have resulted in significant transmission constraints across the United States and increased stress on aging equipment. These problems will continue without increased investment in transmission infrastructure. Transmission system investments can also increase system reliability and reduce the frequency of power outages. Such investments can reduce transmission constraints and improve access to lower cost generation resources, resulting in a lower overall cost of delivered electricity for end-use consumers. The DOE has established the Office of Electricity that focuses on working with reliability experts from the power industry, state governments and their Canadian counterparts to improve grid reliability and increase investment in the country’s electric infrastructure. In addition, the FERC has signaled its desire for substantial new investment in the transmission sector by implementing various financial and other incentives.
The FERC has also issued orders to promote non-discriminatory transmission access for all transmission customers. In the United States, electric transmission assets are predominantly owned, operated and maintained by utilities that also own electricity generation and distribution assets, known as vertically integrated utilities. The FERC has recognized that the vertically-integrated utility model inhibits the provision of non-discriminatory transmission access and, in order to alleviate this potential discrimination, the FERC has mandated that all transmission systems over which it has jurisdiction must be operated in a comparable, non-discriminatory manner such that any seller of electricity affiliated with a TO or transmission operator is not provided with preferential treatment. The FERC has also indicated that independent transmission companies can play a prominent role in furthering its policy goals and has encouraged the legal and functional separation of transmission operations from generation and distribution operations.
The FERC requires compliance with certain reliability standards by TOs and may take enforcement actions for violations, including the imposition of substantial fines. NERC is responsible for developing and enforcing these mandatory reliability standards. We continually assess our transmission systems against standards established 
10

by NERC, as well as the standards of applicable regional entities under NERC that have been delegated certain authority for the purpose of proposing and enforcing reliability standards. Finally, utility holding companies are subject to FERC regulations related to access to books and records in addition to the requirement of the FERC to review and approve mergers and consolidations involving utility assets and holding companies in certain circumstances.
Federal Regulation
As electric transmission companies, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries charge rates that are regulated by the FERC. The FERC is an independent regulatory commission within the DOE that regulates the interstate transmission and certain wholesale sales of natural gas, the transmission of oil and oil products by pipeline and the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce. The FERC also administers accounting and financial reporting regulations and standards of conduct for the companies it regulates. In 1996, in order to facilitate open access transmission for participants in wholesale power markets, the FERC issued Order No. 888. Order No. 888 encouraged investor owned utilities to cede operational control over their transmission systems to ISOs, which are not-for-profit entities.
As an alternative to ceding operating control of their transmission assets to ISOs, certain investor owned utilities began to promote the formation of for-profit transmission companies, which would assume control of the operation of the grid. In 1999, the FERC issued Order No. 2000, which strongly encouraged utilities to voluntarily transfer operational control of their transmission systems to RTOs. RTOs, as envisioned in Order No. 2000, would assume many of the functions of an ISO, but the FERC permitted greater flexibility with regard to the organization and structure of RTOs than it had for ISOs. RTOs could accommodate the inclusion of independently owned, for-profit companies that own transmission assets within their operating structure. Independent ownership would facilitate not only the independent operation of the transmission systems, but also the formation of companies with a greater financial interest in maintaining and augmenting the capacity and reliability of those systems. RTOs, such as MISO and SPP, monitor electric reliability and are responsible for coordinating the operation of the wholesale electric transmission system and ensuring fair, non-discriminatory access to the transmission grid.
In 2011, the FERC issued Order No. 1000, which amends certain existing transmission planning and cost allocation requirements to ensure that FERC-jurisdictional services are provided at just and reasonable rates and on a basis that is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. Order No. 1000 can create competition for certain future transmission projects, including within our current operating areas. As a part of our identification of incremental development opportunities as it relates to our plans, we are exploring opportunities resulting from Order No. 1000 within MISO and SPP as well as other RTOs.
Revenue Requirement Calculations and Cost Sharing for Projects with Regional Benefits
The cost-based Formula Rates used by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries include revenue requirement calculations for various types of projects. Network revenues continue to be the largest component of revenues recovered through our Formula Rates. However, regional cost sharing revenues have experienced long-term growth as a result of projects that have been identified as having regional benefits and are therefore eligible for regional cost recovery. Separate calculations of revenue requirement are performed for projects that have been approved for regional cost sharing.
We have projects that are eligible for regional cost sharing under the MISO tariff, such as certain network upgrade projects, and the MVPs, including our portions of the four MVPs and the Thumb Loop Project in Michigan. Additionally, certain projects at ITC Great Plains are eligible for recovery through a region-wide charge in the SPP tariff, including three regional cost sharing projects in Kansas.
State Regulation
The regulatory agencies in the states where our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ assets are located do not have jurisdiction over our rates or terms and conditions of service. However, they typically have jurisdiction over siting of transmission facilities and related matters as described below. Additionally, we are subject to the regulatory oversight of various state environmental quality departments for compliance with any state environmental standards and regulations.

Sources of Revenue
See “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Significant Components of Results of Operations — Revenues” for a discussion of our principal sources of revenue.
Seasonality
The cost-based Formula Rates in effect for our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, as discussed in “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cost-Based Formula Rates with True-Up Mechanism,” mitigate the seasonality of net income for our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries. Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries accrue or defer revenues to the extent that the actual revenue requirement for the reporting period is higher or lower, respectively, than the amounts billed relating to that reporting period. For example, to the extent that amounts billed are less than our revenue requirement for a reporting period, a revenue accrual is recorded for the difference and the difference results in no net income impact.
Operating cash flows are seasonal at our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, in that cash received for revenues is typically higher in the summer months when peak load is higher.
Principal Customers
Our principal transmission service customers are DTE Electric, Consumers Energy and IP&L, which accounted for approximately 21.4%, 23.1% and 26.6%, respectively, of our consolidated billed revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. One or more of these customers together have consistently represented a significant percentage of our operating revenue. These percentages of total billed revenues of DTE Electric, Consumers Energy and IP&L include the collection of 2016 revenue accruals and deferrals and exclude any amounts for the 2018 revenue accruals and deferrals that were included in our 2018 operating revenues, but will not be billed to our customers until 2020. Refer to “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cost-Based Formula Rates with True-Up Mechanism” for a discussion on the difference 
13

between billed revenues and operating revenues. Our remaining revenues were generated from providing service to other entities such as alternative electricity suppliers, power marketers and other wholesale customers that provide electricity to end-use consumers and from transaction-based capacity reservations. Nearly all of our revenues are from transmission customers in the United States. Although we may recognize allocated revenues from time to time from Canadian entities reserving transmission over the Ontario or Manitoba interface, these revenues have not been and are not expected to be material to us.
Billing
MISO and SPP are responsible for billing and collecting the majority of our transmission service revenues as well as independently administering the transmission tariff in their respective service territory. As the billing agents for our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and ITC Great Plains, MISO and SPP independently bill DTE Electric, Consumers Energy, IP&L and other customers on a monthly basis and collect fees for the use of our transmission systems. 
See “Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Credit Risk” for discussion of our credit policies.
Competition
Each of our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries operates the primary transmission system in its respective service area and has limited competition for certain projects. However, the competitive environment is evolving due to the implementation of the FERC Order No. 1000. See further discussion of Order No. 1000 above under “Regulatory Environment — Federal Regulation.” For our subsidiaries focused on development opportunities for transmission investment in other service areas, the incumbent utilities or other entities with transmission development initiatives may compete with us by seeking approval to be named the party authorized to build new capital projects that we are also pursuing. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 692 employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
