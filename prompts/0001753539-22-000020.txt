ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background and Merger
On September 9, 2021, our predecessor company f/k/a Osprey Technology Acquisition Corp. (“Osprey”), consummated its merger with Osprey Technology Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Osprey, and BlackSky Holdings, Inc. (“Legacy BlackSky”) (the “Merger”). Immediately following the Merger, Osprey changed its name to “BlackSky Technology Inc.” Legacy BlackSky survived the Merger and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackSky Technology Inc. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “BlackSky”, “the Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the business and operations of Legacy BlackSky and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Merger and to BlackSky Technology Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, following the closing of the Merger.
Our Class A Common Stock (“Class A common stock”) and warrants are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbols “BKSY” and “BKSY.W”, respectively.
Overview 
Founded in 2014, BlackSky is a leading provider of real-time geospatial intelligence. We provide on-demand and high frequency monitoring and artificial intelligence (“AI”)-enabled analytics of the most critical and strategic locations, economic assets, and events on planet Earth. The actionable intelligence we gather and deliver is relied upon by many of the most important and demanding government and commercial organizations in the world, including United States defense and intelligence agencies and international ministries of defense. Our Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) platform, Spectra AI delivers to our customers automated alerts, data, and insights, providing them with a first-to-know advantage that they use to support day-to-day decision making. BlackSky’s offerings are designed to support a broad range of government and commercial applications including national and homeland security, supply chain intelligence, crisis management, critical infrastructure monitoring, economic intelligence, and others. 
We own and operate one of the industry’s leading high-performance low earth orbit (“LEO”) small satellite (“smallsat” or “smallsats”) constellations. Our constellation is optimized to cost-efficiently capture imagery at high frequencies where and when our customers need it. The orbital configuration of our constellation is designed to collect data on the most critical and strategic locations on Earth where we believe approximately 90% of the global GDP occurs. With twelve satellites on orbit currently, our constellation is able to image certain locations every hour, from dawn to dusk, providing our customers with insights and situational awareness throughout the day. Our satellites are designed with agile pointing capabilities that enable our customers to task our constellation on demand to collect specific locations of interest. Our tasking methodology employs proprietary AI-enabled software to efficiently collect the most important areas of interest to our customers. We believe that our focus on critical, strategic, and economic infrastructure and the AI-enabled tasking of our constellation differentiates us from our competitors, who are dedicated primarily to mapping the entirety of the Earth every day and who, therefore, require up to hundreds of satellites or incrementally more expensive satellites to support their mission. Our focused approach enables us to deliver highly targeted and valuable intelligence with a smaller constellation that has the added benefit of greater operating and capital efficiencies. 
BlackSky’s Spectra AI software platform processes millions of observations a day from our proprietary satellite constellation and from multiple external data sources including imaging, radar and radio frequency satellites, environmental sensors, asset tracking sensors, Internet of Things (“IoT”) connected devices, internet-enabled narrative sources, and a variety of geotemporal data feeds. Spectra AI employs advanced, proprietary AI and machine learning (“ML”) techniques to process, analyze, and transform these data feeds into alerts, information, and insights. Customers can access Spectra AI’s data and analytics through easy-to-use web services or through platform application programming interfaces (“APIs”). 
Our operating strategy is to continue to enhance the capabilities of our satellite constellation, to increase the number of third-party data sources processed by Spectra AI, and to expand our analytics offerings in order to increase the value we deliver to our customers. Our two operating assets—our satellite constellation and our Spectra AI software platform—are mutually reinforcing: as we capture ever more information about the world’s most 
Table of Contents

important economic and strategic locations, our proprietary database expands and increases its utility; enabling us to better detect, understand, and predict changes that matter most to our customers. Our business has a natural and powerful “flywheel” effect: the more data we collect and analyze, the more valuable the insights we can deliver to our customers. 
Our First-to-Know Strategy 
Our vision is to build the world’s leading geospatial data and analytics platform. We plan to capitalize on a secular market shift away from static/low frequency satellite imaging and geospatial solutions toward on-demand access of real-time geospatial intelligence. Our strategy is to capitalize on the rapid growth and deployment of millions of low cost GPS enabled terrestrial, IoT, and space based sensors to monitor global events and activities in real-time. As we are now entering a new commercial space age, the number of commercial sensors on orbit has expanded from a handful of large expensive commercial satellites just a few years ago to now hundreds and in the near future thousands of sensors that will ultimately change the way we see and understand our world. BlackSky has built a software platform to capitalize on this major market shift to integrate the data from these sensors and through an AI-enabled software platform to transform these raw data feeds into real-time actionable intelligence to provide customers with a first-to-know advantage. 
Our mission is to enable our existing and future customers to improve critical outcomes by incorporating BlackSky’s proprietary real-time geospatial intelligence and analytics into their decision-making processes through a modern SaaS customer experience at a lower total cost. We can deliver our proprietary geospatial imagery on-demand at a lower cost than legacy providers due to our cost-efficiencies, capital efficient constellation design, and adaptable pricing models, among other things. 
Our Vertically Integrated Space and Software Platform 
We own and operate a constellation of high-resolution, high-revisit, LEO smallsats and our constellation is optimized to provide high-frequency monitoring of important strategic and economically relevant locations around the world. We can collect images throughout the day at high-revisit rates, enabling us to see events as they are happening. Through our Spectra AI platform, we provide on demand tasking and site monitoring services with integrated analytics to provide customers with improved situational awareness, change detection and analysis, and time-based pattern of life analysis to provide critical real-time information to decision makers. 
Our current constellation consists of twelve LEO smallsats in commercial operations. We expect to add up to four additional satellites to our commercial operations by the end of 2022. We currently collect hundreds of images each day, which under optimal conditions, results in a peak revisit rate of 15 hourly revisits per day over critical strategic and economic locations. Our average daily revisit rate, from dawn to dusk, is 8 to 10 times a day or approximately every 60 to 90 minutes. As our satellite constellation grows, the amount of data we collect will scale, and we expect our revisit rate will improve. 
Our satellite constellation is supported by our proprietary autonomous mission operations software and our global ground station network. Our mission operations software processes tasking requests from our customers and optimizes collection across our constellation. Our customers can task our satellites and request related analytics through our web-based user interface from their desktops or mobile devices or programmatically through our API, which is typically embedded with customers or certain reseller channels such as Palantir Technologies. In addition, our Spectra AI platform provides autonomous tasking, mission planning, command and control services, health and safety monitoring of our constellation, and automated generation and distribution of image and imagery derived products. 
Our Spectra AI platform is built for scalability on the Amazon Web Services platform. Our Spectra AI platform offers a full software stack that includes a data and sensor integration layer, an extract, transform, load (“ETL”) layer, an analytics layer that hosts our AI and ML algorithms, an application layer for our customers, an API framework for developers and our global intelligence database that captures sensor data.

•Imagery Services: We offer our customers high-revisit, on-demand high resolution electro optic satellite imaging services. Through our Spectra AI platform, customers can directly task our proprietary small satellite constellation to collect and deliver imagery over specific locations, sites, and regions that are critical to their operations. We offer customers several service level options that include basic plans for on-demand tasking or multi-year assured access programs, where customers can secure priority access and imaging capacity over a region of interest on a take or pay basis. 
•Data, Software, and Analytics: Our analytics services are also offered on a subscription basis and provide customers with access to our site monitoring, event monitoring and global data services. We leverage our proprietary AI and ML algorithms to analyze data coming from both our proprietary sensor network and third-party sources in real-time to provide data, insights, and analytics for our customers. We provide services related to object, change and anomaly detection, site monitoring, and enhanced analytics through which we can detect key pattern of life changes in critical locations. These critical locations can include strategic locations and infrastructure such as ports, airports, and construction sites; retail activity; commodities stockpiles; and other sites that contain critical commodities and supply chain inventory.
As part of our imagery and software analytic services, we provide professional service solutions to support customer-specific feature requests and to support the integration, testing, and training of our imagery and software analytical services into a customer’s organizational processes and workflows. We also provide software systems engineering development services to support the integration of high volume and mass quantities of data into their operating platforms.
We offer a variety of pricing and utilization options for our imagery and software analytical service offerings, including usage-based pricing, subscriptions and transactional licenses. These options provide customers flexible options to utilize our imagery and software analytical services in a manner that best suits their business needs. We offer a range pricing tiers that enables the customer to manage collection priorities, where during critical events they can pay a premium to prioritize their monitoring and collection requirements. At other times, customers can select lower priority collections to allow for more economical utilization. We currently derive revenue from variable and fixed pricing plans that allow our customers to choose what matters most to them—platform licensing-levels, priority for imagery tasking, and whether to apply analytics or monitoring capabilities overtop the imaging service.
•Engineering and Systems Integration—We develop and deliver advanced launch vehicle, satellite, and payload systems for specific strategic customers that desire to leverage our capabilities in mission systems engineering and operations, ground station operations, software, analytics and systems development. These systems are typically sold to government customers under fixed price contracts and are often bundled with our imagery services offerings.
Our Customers 
To compete effectively in today’s data-driven market environment, organizations of all sizes and industries face a growing need for timely and affordable geospatial intelligence and analytics. To meet these customer demands, next generation geospatial intelligence platforms must have the ability to deliver situational awareness, location intelligence, and insights into events and activities as they are happening. Geospatial intelligence plays an increasingly critical role in decision making for government and commercial organizations. Our current customer base and end market mix are weighted towards U.S. and international defense and intelligence customers and markets. We believe there are significant opportunities to expand our imagery and software analytical services, as well as our engineering and systems integration offerings, to customers both domestically and internationally.

We intend to expand and scale our sales to commercial customers by targeting a wide range of end markets in which we anticipate rapidly growing demand for geospatial intelligence, including energy and utilities, insurance, mining, manufacturing, agriculture, environmental, engineering and construction, commodities, and supply chain management. 
Our Satellite Constellation 
We design, develop, manufacture, and operate a constellation of proprietary smallsats. These satellites are purpose-built to serve our mission and form the foundation of our Spectra AI platform. Weighing about 55 kilograms each, these compact, high-tech satellites are comparable in size to a miniature refrigerator. Each satellite is equipped with a modern, commercially derived optical telescope that collects imagery with an average resolution of one meter. This allows us the capability of distinguishing landscape features such as roads and buildings, and gauging commercial activities such as shipping from ports, monitoring tanker trucks. and changes in production by estimating the number of cars in a factory parking lot. Commercial satellite imagery has multiple applications and is of significant interest to the military for high-revisit monitoring of airfields and troop buildup and detecting changes in pattern-of-life from multi-frame imagery. Launched into a LEO approximately 450 kilometers above the surface of the Earth, our constellation of twelve imaging satellites (including seven launched in 2021) are optimally distributed to provide maximum coverage for our customers in the government and commercial sectors. With eleven globally distributed ground stations, our constellation is designed for rapid tasking, collection, and delivery of high-revisit, high-resolution imagery and data analytics. This year we expect to add up to four additional satellites to our commercial operations, thus further improving our revisit coverage and replacing two of our satellites that have reached the end of their design life. 
Our constellation is supported by a secure, fully cloud-enabled satellite operations system, a user-friendly, web-based tasking system, and a scalable, cloud-based Spectra AI platform. Working together seamlessly, these systems allow us to utilize continuously evolving AI and ML technologies to fuse open-source intelligence feeds with satellite imagery to provide information and intelligence on critical objects of interest.
Our next generation satellites, Gen-3, are designed with significantly enhanced capabilities, improving our imaging resolution to 50 centimeters, and include short wave infrared imaging technology for a broad set of imaging conditions such as nighttime and low-light. Gen-3 satellites are expected to launch in late 2023. We believe these advancements will expand the relevance and certainty of our analytics to continue to ensure our importance to our customers. We also believe the combination of our high-revisit, small satellite constellation, our Spectra AI platform, and low constellation cost are disrupting the market for geospatial imagery and space-based data and analytics.
Our cost efficient smallsats are designed from the ground-up to optimize performance per unit cost. We can deliver our proprietary geospatial imagery on demand at lower costs than legacy providers due to our cost-efficiencies, capital efficient constellation design, and adaptable pricing models, among other things.. 
We are vertically integrated and manufacture our satellites through LeoStella, a 50%-owned satellite manufacturing joint venture with Thales Alenia Space. LeoStella is capable of manufacturing 40 satellites per year. Our vertical integration enables BlackSky to control our satellites through the entire design, manufacturing, and operation process. The LeoStella partnership allows us to learn from and leverage their manufacturing expertise and commercial best practices.

Total Addressable Market 
We operate in a large and growing market. The space data and analytics market is benefiting from an increase in demand as geospatial intelligence plays an increasingly critical role in decision making for government agencies and commercial organizations. According to independent industry analysts and management estimates, the geospatial analytics market is expected to grow annual revenues globally from approximately $13 billion in 2020 to over $40 billion in 2024, a compound annual growth rate of 25.2%.
Government customers are reliant on geospatial imaging and intelligence solutions to monitor key changes around the globe, including the activities of potentially hostile actors and event monitoring at key strategic locations. 
Commercial customers are also turning to geospatial solutions for a variety of applications and increasingly rely on rapid access to geospatial data related to emerging events for key decision making. We believe these customers will not only come from existing users of space based imaging and analytics but also increasingly from other imaging and analytical sectors such as aerial surveillance. Due to the significantly lower price point than legacy satellite imaging and analytics we believe there will be new opportunities in many commercial sectors to embed our services into businesses processes thus opening up new markets for revenue generation in the future. We expect numerous commercial markets to expand their use of geospatial intelligence, including: energy and utilities, insurance, mining and manufacturing, agriculture, environmental, engineering and construction, retail and supply chain. 
The increase in demand for geospatial imaging and intelligence at a time when we believe satellite capacity is stagnant, which has resulted in a capacity-constrained market, particularly from trusted suppliers. We believe that legacy satellite imaging solutions may not be sufficient to provide the capacity needed to meet the growing demand as their aging constellations are being replaced with lower capacity satellites. We expect there to be continued unmet demand in the market that will need to be addressed by emerging, disruptive solutions. We believe that we are a first mover and that we will be well-positioned to capture a significant portion of the growing space data and analytics market. 
Our Competitive Differentiation 
We believe that we are well-positioned to compete with legacy satellite imaging providers and other emergent geospatial intelligence providers due to our strategy to combine a high-revisit satellites constellation with an AI-enabled SaaS platform. This approach enables us to address three primary barriers that have limited the legacy industry in achieving a broader market adoption and penetration including: easy access to data and information 
Table of Contents

through a modern SaaS platform, access to low cost data, and assured access to imaging services where, when, and at the frequency they need it. Key elements of our competitive differentiation include the following: 
•Low-cost imagery capture. Our smallsat constellation is leveraging the disruptive economics of small satellites to enable us to capture data in a more cost-effective manner than legacy satellite imagery providers.
