General Overview
 
Our company was initially incorporated as Knight Knox Development Corp. in the State of Nevada on May 2, 2011 with a plan to develop an online business using our domain www.offeritnow.com to generate revenues by (i) selling advertisement space to third party websites, (ii) charging a fee for listing items for sale on the Company’s website or (iii) selling items on the auction section of the website. On November 18, 2016, James Manley, who had served as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and director resigned from our company. On that date Peter O’Brien acquired all 6,000,000 shares of common stock of the company that had previously been owned by James Manley and assumed the positions of President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and director of our company.
 
On November 16, 2016, we registered a wholly-owned subsidiary in Ireland, Trinity Reliant Ventures Limited, to oversee its European operations. To date, activities within the subsidiary have consisted of raising equity capital and performing limited research in the United Kingdom.
 
On January 19, 2017, a majority of our stockholders and our Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a change of our company’s name to Reactive Medical, Inc. to pursue the licensing, development and commercialization of cannabinoid-based therapeutic treatments.
 
On April 3, 2017, Mr. O’Brien resigned from the positions of President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of our company and the Board appointed Gregory Gorgas to assume each of those positions. At that time, Mr. Gorgas also became a member of our Board. Mr. O’Brien retained his seat on the Board and was appointed Senior Vice President – European Operations. Mr. Gorgas purchased a total of 1,760,000 shares of our company’s common stock at a price of $0.001 per share, which shares are subject to a repurchase option by our company should Mr. Gorgas’ employment end prior to the fourth anniversary of the start date of his employment.

On April 14, 2017, with the approval of our Board and stockholders owning at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our company, we filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of Nevada to change our company’s name to Artelo Biosciences, Inc. The name change more accurately informs stockholders about the focus and nature of our company. The name “Artelo” was selected to portray our focus on improving and/or administering products distributed via arterial blood flow, and “Biosciences” to more accurately reflect our focus on drug development, including those derived from botanical sources.
 
On May 2, 2017, we entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement (as amended, the “Analog Agreement”) with Analog Biosciences, Inc. (“Analog”) whereby we obtained an exclusive license to a provisional patent application, and any patent issued thereunder, related to a combination product strategy to produce a synergy with cannabidiol (the “Invention”), which was previously licensed to Analog by a third party. Pursuant to the terms of the Analog Agreement, we have the exclusive right to use and sublicense the Invention, for which we pay Analog a percentage of any sales, any earned royalty and certain other payments. We have prioritized our research efforts with NEOMED’s proprietary therapeutic compound NEO1940 (the “Compound”) and the technology licensed from Stony Brook University and discontinued our development efforts related to the patents licensed from Analog.
 
Also on May 2, 2017, Peter O’Brien, the Senior Vice President – European Operations and majority stockholder entered into an agreement to sell 50% of the shares held by him to an investor for $3,000. In addition, our company increased the size of the Board from two members to four members and appointed Connie Matsui and Steven Kelly as members of our Board.

Current Business
 
We are an ethical biopharmaceutical company focused on licensing, developing and commercializing treatments intended to modulate the endocannabinoid system (the “ECS”). We plan to conduct research with our programs in accordance with traditional drug development standards and available to the general public via prescription or physician orders after obtaining marketing authorization from a regulatory authority, such as the FDA.
 
The ECS is composed of cannabinoid receptors, endogenous receptor ligands (endocannabinoids) and their associated transporter mechanisms, as well as enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids has emerged as a considerable target for pharmacotherapy approaches of numerous diseases.
 
Modulation of the ECS can be effected by using selective or non-selective agonists, partial agonists, inverse agonists, and antagonists of the cannabinoid receptors (e.g. CB1 and CB2). The actions of endogenous ligands can be enhanced or attenuated by targeting mechanisms that are associated with their transport within the cellular and extra cellular matrix (e.g. FABPs) as well as their synthesis (e.g. DAGL) and breakdown (e.g. FAAH). Allosteric modulation of cannabinoid receptors may also affect how the endogenous receptor ligands associate with the cannabinoid receptors. Small molecule chemical modulators of the ECS can either be derived from the cannabis plant (phytocannabinoids) or can be semi-synthetic derivatives of phytocannabinoids or endocannabinoids, or completely synthetic new chemical entities. Artelo has approaches within its current portfolio that address receptor binding and endocannabinoid transport modulation using both synthetic cannabinoids and new chemical entity approaches. Future approaches may involve targeting synthesis or breakdown enzymes.
 
The ECS is a widespread modulatory system that plays important roles in central nervous system (“CNS”) development, synaptic plasticity, and the response to endogenous and environmental insults. The CB1 receptor is distributed in brain areas associated with motor control, emotional responses, motivated behavior and energy homeostasis. In the periphery, CB1 is ubiquitously expressed in the adipose tissue, pancreas, liver, gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscles, heart and the reproductive system. The CB2 receptor is mainly expressed in the immune system regulating its functions, and is upregulated in response to tissue stress or damage in most cell types. The ECS is therefore involved in pathophysiological conditions in both the central and peripheral tissues. Cannabis, extracts from cannabis, and approved cannabinoid-based medicines are already used to treat numerous medical conditions. The ECS is further implicated in many disease states within the peer reviewed literature including conditions which involve the regulation of food intake, central nervous system, pain, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune and inflammation, behavioral, antiproliferative and reproductive functions. These areas of ECS pathophysiology are aligned with Artelo’s focus therapeutic areas of pain, inflammation, cachexia, cardiovascular, and cancer.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our objective is to develop and commercialize ethical pharmaceutical products that provide physicians access to the therapeutic potential of cannabinoid therapeutics and other modulators of the ECS for their patients. We intend to pursue technologies and compounds that offer promising therapeutic approach to cannabinoid-based therapies, as well as compounds that promote the effectiveness of the ECS. Currently we are evaluating and pursuing several technologies and compounds in each of the following areas: naturally-occurring cannabinoids (e.g. cannabidiol), synthetic cannabinoids, and endocannabinoid modulators. 
Technology
 
We intend to create, acquire, and develop a full spectrum of therapeutics, each of which has the potential to modulate the ECS for human health. The principal scientific platforms of our strategy are as follows: 

· | Synthetics and mimetics
--+------------------------

 
We plan to acquire rights to intellectual property for research and clinical stage assets developed within the pharmaceutical industry and leading research institutions which utilize synthetically developed mimetics or alternatives to plant-based cannabinoids. Our efforts to secure rights to synthetic cannabinoids and proprietary compounds led us to the NEOMED Agreement with NEOMED for the Compound and the discovery of our novel solid state form of cannabidiol.
 

· | New Chemical Entities
--+----------------------


6

 
We expect to license intellectual property rights for research stage platforms and new chemical entities developed within leading academic institutions under which we may develop programs that modulate the ECS. These programs may involve the use of compounds which are neither plant based nor synthetically-derived cannabinoids, but are instead compounds that have been shown to have promising potential for modulating the ECS. Our licensing initiatives for this strategy led us to enter into the Stony Brook FABP5 inhibitor program.
 
Our management, board and scientific advisors have experience developing and commercializing ethical pharmaceutical products, including several first-in-class therapeutics. As we build our pipeline and advance our research and clinical development programs, we will evaluate partnerships with large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies where applicable. Based upon our management’s current experience and the future talent we may attract, we plan to retain rights to develop and commercialize products on our own. However, we will seek collaborations with biopharmaceutical partners should that strategy serve to maximize the value for our stockholders. 
 
Our current pipeline encompasses multiple mechanisms for endocannabinoid system modulation. The specific programs that are currently in development are set forth below:
 

Two of our development programs were licensed from established and respected organizations that have already conducted pre-clinical research and, in some cases, clinical research. Our science and regulatory teams are leveraging this research to speed development and commercialization timelines across our growing portfolio. 
 
ART12.11 – Artelo’s novel cannabidiol composition is targeted for development in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), stroke and rare/orphan diseases. The rare/orphan disease strategy may be influenced by near-term FDA actions with other company’s programs containing cannabidiol, however, Artelo has the intent to prioritize pain conditions associated with inflammation and neurologic conditions such as epilepsy.
 
ART26.12 – Our endocannabinoid transport protein (FABP5) inhibitor is intended for treatment of breast cancer, prostate cancer, and neuropathic and nociceptive pain. Our near-term goal is to identify a lead development compound and assess its activity in models of cancer and pain. Once one or more lead compound(s) are selected, the company intends to initiate IND-enabling studies.
 
ART27.13 – ART27.13 is the Artelo name for the compound formerly known as NEO1940 and AZD1940. As disclosed in Company’s Press Release on January 30, 2018, Artelo expects to identify one or more cancer types with anti-tumor activity and determine which indication the Company will pursue. Artelo also intends to develop a formulation suitable for treatment of anorexia/weight loss associated with cancer. ART27.13 (NEO1940) has been in 205 subjects in prior clinical studies and is clinic-ready for anorexia and our primary intent is to develop the compound as a cancer supportive care therapeutic. In addition, the Company intends to aggressively assess its potential as a cancer therapeutic. If a tumor-type of interest is identified, we plan to discuss with regulatory authorities the specific steps required to initiate anti-tumor clinical studies.

Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and an emphasis on proprietary products. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
We plan to compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnological and other related markets with therapeutics that demonstrate clinical utility, have an acceptable safety profile and target commercially attractive indications characterized by previously unmet medical need.
 
Our potential competitors, which include large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain approval from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We are a party to the NEOMED Agreement with NEOMED, the Stony Brook Agreement with Stony Brook University and the Analog Agreement with Analog, although we have discontinued our work with Analog and, going forward, we intend to license intellectual property from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research institutions which would cover research stage and clinical stage assets to build a pipeline of products that modulate the ECS. 
 
On December 20, 2017, we entered into a Material and Data Transfer, Option and License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with NEOMED Institute, a Canadian not-for-profit corporation (“NEOMED”), that provides the Company with up to twelve months from the date of receipt by the Company of the required materials to conduct certain non-clinical research studies, diligence and technical analyses with NEOMED’s Compound and an option (the “Option”) for an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize products comprising or containing the Compound. The License Agreement has an effective date of January 2, 2018 (the “Effective Date”). In clinical development studies with NEOMED’s prior sponsor, NEO1940 was dosed in over 200 subjects. From 2007 to 2008, NEO1940 was evaluated in five phase I clinical trials under its original sponsor; AstraZeneca. NEO1940 was administered orally in 205 patients and its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were investigated. Four of these studies were single dose or Single Ascending Dose (“SAD”) studies. An initial SAD was conducted in Caucasian population. The program was completed with another study performed in a Japanese population. The two other single dose studies aimed at measuring a pharmacodynamics effect (Proof-of-Principle or POP studies) on analgesia using the capsaicin test in one case of the third molar extraction model in the other case. The last phase I study was a Multiple Ascending Dose (“MAD”) study, where patients with chronic lower back pain received NEO1940 for a scheduled period of twelve days. Further details of the studies are found in Table 1.

NEO1940 demonstrated, in general, an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in the safety endpoints. The profile of the observed safety effects was generally typical of cannabinoids and the majority of the adverse events (the “AEs”) were of mild or moderate intensity. A maximum tolerated dose was defined by the frequency and severity of adverse events. A dose dependent increase in body weight was observed in the MAD study. In three out of the five phase I studies, analgesia in acute pain models was also measured as an end-point; no convincing analgesic efficacy has been seen in any of these studies.
 
NEOMED, without additional consideration and at NEOMED’s sole cost, has agreed to deliver to our company certain technology transfer materials and the quantity of the Compound substance specified in a research plan, both as set out under the License Agreement.

We will evaluate the Compound and then decide whether to exercise the Option. Upon exercise of the Option, NEOMED will provide our company with an exclusive worldwide license under all of NEOMED’s intellectual property rights covering the Compound (“Licensed IP Rights”) to research, develop, make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold and import products containing the Compound and otherwise exploit the Licensed IP Rights in all fields.
 
On January 18, 2018, we entered into the Stony Brook Agreement for an early stage research program to develop, make, manufacture, have made, use, sell, have sold, import, export, and offer for sale Patent Product(s) (as defined in the Stony Brook Agreement) and Other Product(s) (as defined in the Stony Brook Agreement) worldwide in all fields, including human therapeutics. Our company expects to sponsor ongoing research with the research team at Stony Brook University to identify a lead molecule and commence an IND-enabling research program thereafter.
 
Research & Development
 
In view of the urgent need for new and more effective drugs, Artelo intends to combine innovative science and accelerated clinical development to create and develop novel therapies using cannabinoid-based medications and similar compounds which modulate the ECS. Our current research and development efforts have been limited to investigative work surrounding cannabinoids, including creating and developing novel formulations, and evaluating potential opportunities to license technologies from pharmaceutical companies and leading research institutions. As of August 31, 2018, we have entered into contractual commitments to invest funds on direct research and development related activities. Our principal research efforts to date have been with the University of Nottingham, UK and various CRO’s in the US and UK. We intend to conduct cancer related research with NEOMED according to the agreed-upon research plan, as described further in the NEOMED Agreement.
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and the implementing regulations promulgated thereunder. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.

An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 


· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 
· | approval by an independent institutional review board, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCP”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”), requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications; 
· | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity;
· | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 
· | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and 
· | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 

 
In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent they choose to sell any drug products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. For other countries, outside of the European Union, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary. 
 
In the European Union, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. On the other hand, a decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU member states of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU member state, known as the reference EU member state. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU member state. Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU member states.
 
Employees
 
We currently have two full-time employees, Mr. Gregory Gorgas, President and CEO, and Mr. Peter O’Brien, Senior Vice President - European Operations. We engage consultants who provide services on a part-time basis. These employees and consultants conduct or oversee all day-to-day operations of our company including technical development, research, and administration. We have no unionized employees. We currently have no retainers or minimum financial commitments with any of our consultants, contractors or service providers. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
Legal Proceedings
 
Our industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation, including claims regarding patent and other intellectual property rights as well as product liability. As a result, in the future, we may be involved in various legal proceedings from time to time. We are not currently a party to any litigation, nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation that, if determined adversely against us, would have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our Scientific Advisory Board
 
We have a scientific advisory board (the “Advisory Board”) that includes industry experts in cannabinoids, drug discovery and medicine. The composition of the Advisory Board will change over time to meet the research and development demands of the Company drug candidate pipeline. The current Advisory Board consists of the below international experts in their fields:
