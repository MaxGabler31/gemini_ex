ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are a producer of low carb, low calorie premium wines in the United States. Founded in 2019, our wines have rapidly gained visibility, credibility, and a loyal national customer base. We craft and bottle all of our wines in Napa Valley, which makes us a premier premium option in the rapidly growing “better for you” category of wines. Offering bold, crisp, and creamy wines that embody health, warmth, and a deeper connection to wellness and an active lifestyle, we offer a unique and innovative collection of today’s most popular varietals. Our varietals currently include our Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Rosé, as well as a limited Reserve Napa Cabernet Sauvignon. We intend to further expand our portfolio of product offerings in the future. Our wines are strategically priced between $15 and $22 per bottle — price points that support a premium product strategy, appeal to mass markets, and allow us to offer significant value across all consumer distribution channels. Nina Dobrev and Julianne Hough are two of our co-founders.
 
Our wines are exclusively focused on the affordable luxury segment, the fastest growing segment of the wine market according to IWSR, addressing the largest wine drinking segment in the $340 billion world-wide wine market, in which United States consumers spent $53 billion in 2020 for wine produced in the U.S., with an additional $16 billion spent on imported wines in the U.S. Importantly, our wines stand out in the luxury wine market because they address our target demographic customer base’s preference for a low-calorie, low-carb, gluten-free product, while concurrently delivering the quality and taste profile of a premium wine brand. This allows us to position our wines in the rapidly emerging “better for you” segment that seeks to appeal to consumers’ emphasis on a healthy lifestyle. While we believe our product offerings have mass appeal among all consumers of affordable luxury wines, we have positioned the Fresh Vine Wine brand as a complement to the healthy and active lifestyles of younger generation wine consumers.
 
We do not own or operate any vineyards. Instead of cultivating our own grapes, we currently use Fior di Sole, a third-party supplier, to source bulk juice made from grapes. This allows us to leverage our supplier’s broad network of vendor relationships and purchasing power to negotiate favorable cost structures. Because our supplier procures product inputs on our behalf, including bulk juice, we do not currently engage directly with grape growers (“growers”) or bulk distributors of juice (“bulk distributors”). As a result, we have limited front-end supply chain visibility. This is a strategy by design that we believe provides us with access to diversified growers and bulk distributors, which reduces our reliance upon any single vendor and mitigates our exposure to droughts, wildfires, spoilage, contamination and other supply side risks common to the wine industry.
 
Our supplier procures grapes and/or juice for our existing varietals from California. This juice is then stored in bulk in Napa until time of production, at which point it is made available for blending and bottling processes at our Napa Valley production and bottling facility. This is significant in that both blending and bottling must occur within Napa to be considered a Napa wine — a distinctive product attribute that adds significant value to our brand in the eyes of consumers. However, wine produced by the Company will only be labelled with a Napa Valley appellation of origin if it is produced from grapes grown in the Napa Valley American Viticultural Area (AVA). The labels for the Company’s existing wines identify California as the appellation of origin.
 
Our sales channels include wholesale, retail, and our direct-to-consumer (DTC) ecommerce channels. We are able to conduct wholesale distribution of our wine in all 50 states and Puerto Rico and licensed to sell through the DTC channel in 42 states. Our wholesale distribution network includes approximately 20 distributors, including distribution agreements with Southern Glazer’s Wine and Spirits, Johnson Brothers, and Republic National Distributing Company (RNDC), which are widely considered to be the world’s preeminent distributors of beverage alcohol. We have placed our wines directly in-stores of major retailers including: Hy-Vee, Food Lion, Lund’s & Byerly’s, Total Wine, 7-11, and Walgreens, among others.

Our direct to consumer (DTC) channel enables us to sell wine directly to the consumer at full retail prices, currently ranging from approximately $15-$22 per bottle. Although these prices are consistent with our suggested retail prices (SRPs), we incur two mark-ups of approximately 30% each for our distributor and retail partners when selling wine through our wholesale distribution channel, therefore directly reducing our revenue and margins. Because the DTC channel provides significantly higher margins than sales generated through wholesale distributors, we intend to further invest in DTC capabilities to ensure it remains an integral part of our business. We also believe continued investment in DTC technologies and capabilities are critical to maintaining an intimate relationship with our customers, which is becoming increasingly digital. While revenue generated from the sale of wine to United States consumers has been growing at mid-single digit compound annual growth rates over the last several years, revenue from United States wine sales in the lucrative DTC sales channel grew over 27% by volume in 2020, its largest increase ever. Within the United States DTC sales channel, shipments of wine priced under $30 per bottle grew by 41.6% in 2020, and approximately $3.7 billion of revenue was generated by the overall DTC market in the United States.
 
In addition, we are now selling through alternative DTC sales platforms, such as ecommerce marketplaces, product aggregators and virtual distributors, all of which have experienced significant recent growth, as well as sales through home delivery services. IWSR reports an 80% increase in the value of ecommerce alcohol sales overall in 2020 as compared to 2019, and aggregators and virtual distributors, have such as Drizly, Go Puff, and Wine.com, have reported 350% and 115%, respectively, in 2020 as compared to 2019.
 
Our Strengths
 
Differentiated Product Offerings — Premium, Napa Valley Wines within the “Better For You” Segment
 
We offer wines that are differentiated from those sold by other wine producers operating within the better-for-you segment of the affordable luxury category based on our premium quality, our association with an award winning winemaker and our Napa Valley based production.

● | Premium Wines. Premium wines are differentiated from other varietals based on consumers’ perception and expectation that they are of exceptional quality. We have developed a proprietary winemaking process that produces superior quality and taste in the affordable luxury wine category based on consumer preferences data, direct consumer feedback and careful market research. Importantly, our current wines stand out in the luxury wine market because they address consumers’ growing preference for a less-calorie, less-carb, less sugar and gluten-free option, while concurrently delivering the quality and taste profile of a premium wine brand.

● | Award-Winning Winemaker. We conducted an international search to find an accomplished winemaker who shared the Fresh Vine Wine vision and have entered into an agreement with Jamey Whetstone, an established, award winning winemaker from Napa Valley, to develop our wines. Consulting with the Fresh Vine Wine brand compliments Mr. Whetstone’s lifestyle as an active surfer, skier, and all-around outdoorsman. His passion for winemaking is mirrored by his passion for adventure, and he too wanted to create a better-for-you wine that customers can be proud to bring to the table for any occasion. We believe it is unique for a high-profile winemaker like Mr. Whetstone to attach his name and reputation to a brand in the better-for-you wine segment, and we believe that Mr. Whetstone’s association with our brand increases consumer awareness and speaks to the quality of our varietals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Produced and Bottled in Napa Valley. Importantly, we are able to market our wines as being produced and bottled in Napa Valley, California. We believe that this designation impacts consumption decisions of many wine drinkers, as Napa Valley-produced wines are considered by many to be a sign of superior quality. However, wine produced by the Company will only be labelled with a Napa Valley appellation of origin if it is produced from grapes grown in the Napa Valley American Viticultural Area (AVA). The labels for the Company’s existing wines identify California as the appellation of origin. Currently, this only applies to our Reserve wine. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Capital-Efficient and Scalable Operational Structure
 
We have strategically structured our organization and operations to minimize our capital investment requirements while maintaining flexibility to rapidly scale our production capabilities to meet consumer demands. We do this by utilizing our internal capabilities while leveraging a network of reputable third-party providers with industry experience and expertise that we use to perform various functions falling outside our internal core competencies.

Production and Bottling on an Alternating Proprietorship Basis
 
We contract with Fior di Sole, an industry leading packaging innovation and wine production company based in Napa Valley, California, to serve as a “host winery” and to occupy a portion of its production and warehouse facility and utilize its production equipment on an alternating proprietorship basis. Under this arrangement, we use capacity at Fior di Sole’s production facility at times mutually convenient to us and Fior di Sole to produce and bottle our wines for an initial set-up fee and a recurring monthly fee. Fior di Sole is responsible for keeping its production equipment in good operating order. When the alternating Premises is operated by or used on behalf of our Company, it is operated pursuant to our federal basic permit and California winegrower’s license. Under the agreement, we are solely responsible for managing and conducting our own winemaking activities and we make all production decisions relating to our wines. However, we may request use of Fior di Sole’s personnel to perform crush, fermentation, blending, cellar, warehousing, barrel topping and/or bottling services for additional fees. This arrangement has allowed us to commence our operations and build the Fresh Vine Wine brand without having to incur the considerable overhead costs involved with the purchase or full time lease of a production facility. The term of the agreement commenced in July 2019, had an initial term of one year and automatically renews for additional one-year terms unless either party provides 90 days written notice to the other of its intent to terminate at the end of the then current term. Either party may terminate the agreement upon 30 days written notice if the other party is in violation of any law or regulation that renders it impossible to perform its obligations under the agreement for a period of greater than 30 days, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or files for bankruptcy protection, or is in material breach of its obligations under the agreement and such failure to perform is not cured within 30 days of written notice from the other party. We believe we have sufficient capacity under our current agreement or with alternative suppliers to increase production to meet increased consumers’ demand for our wines.
 
Fior di Sole also provides us with bulk juice and blends, finishes, bottles, stops, labels and packages our wine, which reduces our internal overhead expenses and allows us to benefit from that company’s increased purchasing power. Fior di Sole provides these services on a purchase order basis, which purchase orders are subject to the parties’ mutual agreement and governed by a Custom Winemaking and Bottling Agreement. This agreement outlines the schedule for placing orders, the responsibility and schedule for delivery of production materials, procedures for establishing the wine bottling date and delivery date. We are required to remit 20% of the amount due for wine produced, bottled and packaged pursuant to this agreement upon our submission of a purchase order. The payment advance is used by Fior Di Sole to reserve or procure materials on our behalf with additional vendors for bottles, boxes, corks, labels, juice, and other inputs. We, or our winemaker on our behalf, oversees the production at the winery approves all components and aspects of the production process. The balance of the amount due for wine produced, bottled and packaged (the remaining 80%) is due following our quality review and acceptance of the finished product.
 
The ability and willingness of Fior di Sole to supply and provide services to us pursuant to purchase orders delivered under the Custom Winemaking and Bottling Agreement may be affected by competing orders placed by other companies, the demands of those companies or other factors. If Fior di Sole becomes unable or unwilling to supply and provide services to us, we believe we can obtain comparable supplies and services from alternative suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that alternative suppliers will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that alternative suppliers will allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements.
 
Licensing, Tax and Regulatory Compliance
 
We have contracted with a third-party to manage our regulatory licensing and compliance activities. We and maintain licenses that enable us to distribute our wine to all 50 states, and to sell direct-to-consumer from our e-commerce website in 42 states. We currently utilize software tools available to the industry and work with our license compliance service provider to navigate and manage the complex state-by-state tax and other regulations that apply to our operations in the beverage alcohol industry. This has enabled us to expand our operations and grow our revenue while reducing the administrative burden of tax compliance, reporting and product registration.
 
3


Through selective recruiting and hiring, we have also built these capabilities internally; we increasingly perform these activities in-house. This allows us to operate with greater control and responsiveness over regulatory licensing and compliance requirements, ensuring that our brand and each of its underlying varietals is properly licensed across state and federal levels.
 
We believe that leveraging our network of supply chain and compliance partners, consultants and service providers enables us to avoid potential costly and lengthy delays on nearly every aspect of our business, from grapes to packaging materials, and will accelerate our return on capital due to our limited need to procure expensive equipment, real estate, and other capital intensive resources. We believe we are well-positioned to add to or adjust the composition of our provider network as required to serve the needs of our business.
 
Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
We believe we bring a unique sales and marketing approach that will increase the visibility of our brand and product offerings to our target consumers.
 
Multi-Channel Marketing Approach
 
Today’s consumers interact with brands through many channels, from traditional media to social media and other digital channels, and through various in-person and online purchasing methods. In order to build the visibility of our brand and create a grassroots consumer following to support our DTC distribution channel, we have employed a strategic multichannel marketing approach that we believe allows us to engage with our target consumers on their terms to expand and deepen their recognition of our brand. In addition to other mass market promotional activities, our marketing strategy also utilizes modern techniques, efficiency measures, and channels not commonly seen in the wine industry, including a combination of social media lifestyle and wine influencer activities, through which brand ambassadors or “influencers” may conduct promotional activities through the Company’s or their own social media channels including, but not limited to, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Pinterest, among others.
Celebrity-based Affinity
 
Recent years have seen a rise in the creation of celebrity owned and/or endorsed alcoholic beverage brands, which utilizes fans’ affinity towards celebrities to promote their product offerings ad drive sales. We are positioned to take advantage of this trend based on the popularity of Nina Dobrev and Julianne Hough, two of our co-founders, each of whom served on our board of directors prior to our initial public offering.
 
In March 2021, we entered into five-year license agreements with Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough, who have a collective following of approximately 30 million people on their Instagram social media platforms alone, pursuant to which they actively promote our business and varietals of wine. Under these license agreements, each has also granted us a license to use her pre-approved name, likeness, image, and other indicia of identity, as well as certain content published by her on her social media or other channels, on and in conjunction with the sale and related pre-approved advertising and promotion of our varietals of wine and marketing materials. Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to grant any similar license or render services of any sort on behalf of or in connection with any party in the wine category anywhere in the world during the term of her agreement, other than with respect to Company. The license agreements are scheduled to expire in March 2026. However, the license agreements to provide that each of Ms. Dobrev and Ms. Hough will have the right to terminate her agreement if as of the end of calendar year 2023, we have not achieved at least $5.0 million in EBITDA in either fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2023. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions — License Agreements with Nina Dobrev and Julianne Hough.”
 
We also enjoy support from several other celebrity influencers who have supported our brand without any agreement or obligation to do so. Together with celebrity brand ambassadors, our marketing efforts have produced highly visible content, including multiple billboards on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, promotions in connection with the opening of Resort World Casino in Las Vegas, product placements in major sports venues and coverage in various print and television media.

Professional Sports Sponsorships
 
We have entered into sponsorship agreements with professional sports organizations and venues spanning all four major United States professional sports leagues, which support our commitment and outreach to consumers focused on active and healthy lifestyles, including agreements with the following organizations and/or their affiliates:

● | Washington Capitals (NHL) and Washington Wizards (NBA)
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Tampa Bay Rays (MLB)
--+---------------------


● | Washington Commanders (NFL)
--+----------------------------


● | Los Angeles Chargers (NFL)
--+---------------------------

 
These sponsorship arrangements generally provide us with advertising placements at the stadiums and arenas during sporting and concert events, as well as specified media and other advertising and promotional benefits, in exchange for our payment of annual sponsorship fees, including at the following venues:
 

● | Capital One Arena in Washington DC (home to the Washington Capitals, Washington Wizards and Georgetown University basketball teams)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tropicana Field in Tampa, Florida (home of the Tampa Bay Rays)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | A1 Lang Stadium (home of the Tampa Bay Rowdies, a USLC men’s professional soccer team)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Charlotte Sports Park (the Tampa Bay Rays Spring Training facility)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FedEx Field in the Washington, DC metropolitan area (home of the Washington Commanders)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, (in connection with Los Angeles Chargers home games
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Although in-venue sponsorship opportunities were limited during 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe these sponsorships will increase our brand awareness and demand for our wines going forward by reaching mass in-person audiences attending sporting events. In addition, several of our sponsor venues include our wines in their stadium concession offerings; however they are not required to do so under the terms of our sponsorship agreements. As part of our strategic marketing efforts, we intend to pursue additional sponsorship opportunities with other sports organizations and venues.
 
Labelling and Innovative Packaging Initiatives
 
We believe wine labelling can have a big impact on consumers’ purchasing practices. We conduct market research to validate the consistency of our wine labels with our brand narrative. Packaging also continues to be a key driver of brand perception, and we are exploring “active lifestyle packaging” alternatives to traditional bottling that provides an opportunity for our customers to enjoy Fresh Vine Wines in non-traditional settings now and for future years, including bottles with screw-off caps, aluminium cans, and smaller size bottles and cans that can be taken on-the-go and are ideal for in-store point of purchase sales.

Food and Beverage Industry Experience
 
Our executive team operates with a focus on human capital management with a firm belief that quality people, with proven track records can produce quality results. Our leadership team is made up of five multi-disciplinary executives with a proven track record of successfully launching, growing, and operating companies of all sizes and across industries. Supporting this leadership team are deeply skilled individuals in key disciplines.

● | As a former Anheuser-Busch InBev executive, Rick Nechio, our President and one of our co-founders, brings a twenty-two year track record in the adult beverage industry and is a pioneer in the better-for-you wine category. Mr. Nechio’s vision for Fresh Vine Wine has been to offer unprecedented commitment to quality within our category of wines, and he has been key in the development of our brand and our sales and marketing strategies to date.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our Chief Operating Officer, Janelle Anderson, has more than 15 years of experience in the Consumer Products & Goods (CPG) industry, where she worked specifically within the food and beverage space as a marketing executive. With a specific focus on shopper marketing, Ms. Anderson’s experience have played a critical role in influencing our customer messaging and marketing strategies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consulting Agreement with Whetstone Consulting 
 
On June 12, 2019, we entered into a consulting agreement with Whetstone Consulting, through which our winemaker, Jamey Whetstone, does business, which agreement was subsequently amended on May 15, 2020 and amended and restated on March 16, 2021. As amended and restated, the agreement provides the Company with ownership and intellectual property protections for Inventions (as defined therein) conceived, made or reduced to practice by Whetstone Consulting that relate to the services provided to the Company. In addition, Whetstone Consulting has agreed, for a period of one year following termination of the agreement, not to directly or indirectly engage or invest in, be employed by, lend credit to, receive compensation from or render services or advice to any person engaged in a Competing Business located within a twelve-mile radius of a specified Napa, California address. For such purposes, a “Competing Business” means any business relating to the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of any product that competes with any low calorie and/or low sulphite wine products sold or substantially under development by the Company during the one-year restricted period. The agreement does not restrict the acquisition, operation, management, consulting, or other commercial activity by Whetstone Consulting, directly or indirectly in or with a winery, brewery, spirits, or other alcoholic beverage industry business not concerning “low calorie” or “low sulphite” products or services. The agreement also contains non-solicitation restrictions applicable to clients, customers, suppliers, licensors, and employees for a period of one year follow the agreement’s termination, subject to certain exceptions.
 
As partial compensation for Whetstone Consulting’s services to us under the original agreement, we issued Whetstone Consulting 100,000 units representing membership interests in Fresh Grapes, LLC, which represent 619,343 shares on a post-LLC Conversion basis. In addition, under the amended and restated agreement, we pay Whetstone Consulting $5,000 per month. Such monthly compensation will be offset by any distributions made to Whetstone Consulting on account of its equity interest in the Company, of which there have been none to date.
 
The amended and restated agreement had an initial one-year term which expired March 16, 2022, and renews automatically for successive one-year periods unless either party provides advance notice of non-renewal to the other. Whetstone Consulting may terminate the agreement at any time by giving us written notice at least 30 days prior to the termination date. We may terminate the agreement at any time. If we terminate the agreement for “Cause,” as such term is defined in the agreement, Whetstone Consulting is obligated to transfer back to us all of the equity interests in our Company that he received under the original agreement.
 
Related party services
 
In October 2021, we entered into a service agreement with a related party in the wine industry to provide representation and distribution services. Under this agreement, we receive a management fee of $50,000 per month plus a tiered fee ranging between $5.00 and $6.50 per case of the related party’s product sold. The term of the agreement is one year and will automatically renew for additional one-year periods until terminated by either party with thirty days prior written notice.

Our Strategy for Growth
 
We expect to deliver meaningful increases in stockholder value by executing the following strategies to gain brand and product visibility and increase sales and market share:

● | Continuing to establish brand visibility, awareness and credibility through mass and micro marketing tactics and association with other strong brands, including sports organizations, celebrities, influencers and top tier winemakers, among others. These will range from organic to paid media.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing to build grass roots demand through high visibility sales and marketing activities that promote high margin DTC and home delivery sales channels, including continued investment in DTC technologies and capabilities that are critical to maintaining an intimate relationship with consumers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding our U.S.-based wholesale and retail distribution network by leveraging our product and brand differentiation, the emerging better-for-you category and to provide distribution partners with a differentiated value proposition.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuing distribution of our wines internationally.
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Embracing disruptive technologies and customer trends, and exploring and expanding partnerships with other organizations investing in customer-centric technologies, such as home delivery, third party wine clubs and evolving alternative DTC purchasing methods, such as ecommerce marketplaces, product aggregators and virtual distributors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding and strengthening key supply chain relationships, including with current and juice suppliers, bottlers, materials suppliers, and dry goods suppliers, to establish a diversified portfolio of partners across all areas of our supply chain and to maintain effective capital management.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing to add to the Fresh Vine Wine product portfolio by developing new varietals that fit within the better-for-you category and are consistent with our existing brand.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing to invest in packaging innovation, including “active lifestyle packaging” alternatives to traditional bottling that provides an opportunity for our customers to enjoy Fresh Vine Wines in non-traditional settings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capitalizing on upward price mobility — While many other wine companies are experiencing downward price pressure to enter the coveted under $30 category, our wines currently sell for suggested retail prices ranging from $15 to $22 per bottle.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing our on-premises sales effort. COVID-19 severely limited on-premise sales across the industry. We believe as restrictions loosen, there is significant opportunity to capture market share and available shelf space.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing additional wine brands by replicating the strategies used to build the Fresh Vine Wine brand via business service line agreements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
With over 500,000 licensed retail accounts (according to Neilson) in the United States, there remains ample opportunity to continue broadening distribution of our wines as well as increasing the volume of wine sold to existing accounts.
 
Competition
 
The wine industry and alcohol markets generally are intensely competitive. Our wines compete domestically and internationally with other premium or higher quality wines produced in Europe, South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, as well as North America. Our wines compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution capability. The ultimate consumer has many choices of products from both domestic and international producers. Our wines may be considered to compete with all alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.
 
7


At any given time, there are more than 400,000 wine choices available to consumers, differing with one another based on vintage, variety or blend, location and other factors. Accordingly, we experience competition from nearly every segment of the wine industry. Additionally, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, offer a wider range of products, and have greater name recognition, which may give them greater negotiating leverage with distributors and allow them to offer their products in more locations and/or on better terms than us. Nevertheless, we believe that our brand offerings, scalable infrastructure and relationships with the one of the largest domestic distributors will allow us to continue growing our business.
 
IT Systems
 
We rely on various IT systems, owned by us and third parties, to effectively manage our sales and marketing, accounting, financial, legal and compliance functions. Our website is hosted by a third party, and we rely on third-party vendors for regulatory compliance for order processing, shipments and e-commerce functionality. We believe these systems are scalable to support our growth plans. We recognize the value of enhancing and extending the uses of information technology in our business.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
Regulatory framework
 
We, along with our contract growers, producers, manufacturers, distributors, retail accounts and ingredients and packaging suppliers, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by federal, state and local government authorities with respect to registration, production processes, product attributes, packaging, labelling, storage and distribution of wine and other products we make.
 
We are also subject to state and local tax requirements in all states where our wine is sold. We monitor the requirements of relevant jurisdictions to maintain compliance with all tax liability and reporting matters. In California, we are subject to a number of governmental authorities, and are also subject to city and county building, land use, licensing and other codes and regulations.
 
Alcohol-related regulation
 
We are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by federal, state and local laws regulating the production, distribution and sale of consumable food items, and specifically alcoholic beverages, including by the TTB and the FDA. The TTB is primarily responsible for overseeing alcohol production records supporting tax obligations, issuing wine labelling guidelines, including grape source and bottle fill requirements, as well as reviewing and issuing certificates of label approval, which are required for the sale of wine through interstate commerce. We carefully monitor compliance with TTB rules and regulations, as well the state law of each state in which we sell our wines. In California, where most of our wines are made, we are subject to alcohol-related licensing and regulations by many authorities, including the ABC. ABC agents and representatives investigate applications for licenses to sell alcoholic beverages, report on the moral character and fitness of alcohol license applicants and the suitability of premises where sales are to be conducted and enforce California alcoholic beverages laws. We are subject to municipal authorities with respect to aspects of our operations, including the terms of our use permits. These regulations may limit the production of wine and control the sale of wine, among other elements.
 
Employee and occupational safety regulation
 
We are subject to certain state and federal employee safety and employment practices regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and regulations governing prohibited workplace discriminatory practices and conditions, including those regulations relating to COVID-19 virus transmission mitigation practices. These regulations require us to comply with manufacturing safety standards, including protecting our employees from accidents, providing our employees with a safe and non-hostile work environment and being an equal opportunity employer. In California, we are also subject to employment and safety regulations issued by state and local authorities.
 
8


Environmental regulation
 
As a result of our wine production activities, we and certain third parties with which we work are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Federal regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater and stormwater discharges, and the treatment, handling and storage and disposal of materials and wastes. State environmental regulations and authorities intended to address and oversee environmental issues are largely state-level analogues to federal regulations and authorities intended to perform the similar purposes. In California, we are also subject to state-specific rules, such as those contained in the California Environmental Quality Act, California Air Resources Act, Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, California Water Code sections 13300-13999 and Title 23 of the California Administrative Code and various sections of the Health and Safety Code. We are subject to local environmental regulations that address a number of elements of our wine production process, including air quality, the handling of hazardous waste, recycling, water use and discharge, emissions and traffic impacts.
 
Labelling regulation
 
Many of our wines are identified by their appellation of origin, which are among the most highly regarded wine growing regions in the world. An appellation may be present on a wine label only if it meets the requirements of applicable state and federal regulations that seek to ensure the consistency and quality of wines from a specific terroir. These appellations designate the specific geographic origin of most or all (depending on the appellation) of the wine’s grapes, and can be a political subdivision (e.g., a country, state or county) or a designated viticultural area. The rules for vineyard designation are similar. Although we expect that most of our labels will maintain the same appellation of origin from year to year, we may choose to change the appellation of one or more of our wines from time to time to take advantage of high-quality grapes in other areas or to change the profile of a wine.
 
Privacy and security regulation
 
We collect personal information from individuals. Accordingly, we are subject to several data privacy and security related regulations, including but not limited to: U.S. state privacy, security and breach notification laws; the GDPR; and other European privacy laws as well as privacy laws being adopted in other regions around the world. In addition, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting existing federal and state consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of information about individuals. Certain states have also adopted robust data privacy and security laws and regulations. For example, the CCPA, which took effect in 2020, imposes obligations and restrictions on businesses regarding their collection, use, and sharing of personal information and provides new and enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording them the right to access and delete their personal information and to opt out of certain sharing of personal information. In response to the data privacy laws and regulations discussed above and those in other countries in which we do business, we have implemented several technological safeguards, processes, contractual third-parties provisions, and employee trainings to help ensure that we handle information about our employees and customers in a compliant manner. We maintain a global privacy policy and related procedures, and train our workforce to understand and comply with applicable privacy laws.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We strive to protect the reputation of our wine brand. We establish, protect and defend our intellectual property in a number of ways, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, domestic and foreign trademark protections, intellectual property licenses and social media and information security policies for employees. We have been granted three (3) trademark registrations in the United States for FRESH VINE®, FRESH VINE (Stylized)®, and our FV Logo®, and numerous trademark registrations in other countries for the FRESH VINE mark, and we have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect any newly-developed wine brands. We have also been granted a copyright registration in the first version of our website located at www.freshvine.com. Information contained on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference in or otherwise a part of this report. As a copyright exists in a work of art once it is fixed in tangible medium, we intend to continue to file copyright applications to protect newly-developed works of art that are important to our business.
 
We also rely on, and carefully protect, proprietary knowledge and expertise, including the sources of certain supplies, formulations, production processes, innovation regarding product development and other trade secrets necessary to maintain and enhance our competitive position.

Seasonality
 
There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement and transportation of grapes. The wine industry in general tends to experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue and net income, with lower sales and net income during the quarter spanning January through March and higher sales and net income during the quarter spanning from October through December due to the usual timing of seasonal holiday buying. As our operations expand, we expect that we will be impacted by the seasonality experienced in the wine industry generally.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2022, we had approximately 16 full-time employees. All of our employees are employed in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Legal Proceedings
 
We may be subject to legal disputes and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are not a party or subject to any pending legal proceedings the resolution of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition.
Corporate History
 
We were initially organized on May 8, 2019 as a Texas limited liability company under the name “Fresh Grapes, LLC.” In connection with our initial public offering, on December 8, 2021, we converted from a Texas limited liability company into a Nevada corporation and changed our name from Fresh Grapes, LLC to Fresh Vine Wine, Inc., which we refer to herein as the “LLC Conversion.” In conjunction with the LLC Conversion, all of our outstanding units were converted into shares of our common stock based on the relative ownership interests of our pre-IPO equity holders. While operating as a limited liability company, our outstanding equity was referred to as “units.” In this report for ease of comparison, we may refer to such units as our common stock for periods prior to the LLC Conversion, unless otherwise indicated in this report. Similarly, unless otherwise indicated, we may refer to members’ equity in this report as stockholders’ equity. Further, while operating as a limited liability company, our governing body was referred to as our Board of Managers, with the members thereof being referred to as “Managers.” We may refer to such governing body throughout this report as our board of directors and such individuals as our directors.
