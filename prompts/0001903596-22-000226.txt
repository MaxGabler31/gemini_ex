Industry and Regulatory Overview
 
As of the date of this filing, thirty-five states, including the state of Colorado, the District of Columbia and four U.S. Territories currently have laws broadly legalizing cannabis in some form for either medicinal or recreational use governed by state specific laws and regulations. Although legalized in some states, cannabis is a “Schedule 1” drug under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”) and is illegal under federal law.
 
On August 29, 2013, The Department of Justice set out its prosecutorial priorities in light of various states legalizing cannabis for medicinal and/or recreational use. The “Cole Memorandum” provided that when states have implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to threaten the federal priorities. Indeed, a robust system may affirmatively address those priorities by, for example, implementing effective measures to prevent diversion of cannabis outside of the regulated system and to other states, prohibiting access to cannabis by minors, and replacing an illicit cannabis trade that funds criminal enterprises with a tightly regulated market in which revenues are tracked and accounted for. In those circumstances, consistent with the traditional allocation of federal-state efforts in this area, the Cole Memorandum provided that enforcement of state law by state and local law enforcement and regulatory bodies should remain the primary means of addressing cannabis-related activity. If state enforcement efforts are not sufficiently robust to protect against the harms set forth above, the federal government may seek to challenge the regulatory structure itself in addition to continuing to bring individual enforcement actions, including criminal prosecutions, focused on those harms.

On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all United States Attorneys concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. Mr. Sessions rescinded all previous prosecutorial guidance issued by the Department of Justice regarding cannabis, including the August 29, 2013 “Cole Memorandum”.
 
In rescinding the Cole Memorandum, Mr. Sessions stated that U.S. Attorneys must decide whether or not to pursue prosecution of cannabis activity based upon factors including: the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. Mr. Sessions reiterated that the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana continues to be a crime under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.
 
On March 23, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law a $1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill that included an amendment known as “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer,” which prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent certain states “from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis.”
 
On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill.” Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, was classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, and so illegal under the federal CSA.
 
With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.
 
Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive “high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis—or marijuana—under the CSA and would not be legally protected under this new legislation and would be treated as an illegal Schedule 1 drug.
 
Additionally, there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under Occupational Health and Safety Act—both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems.
 The Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.
 
One of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort. Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further, section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also recognizes that there is a still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives.
 
As a result of the November, 2020 federal elections, and the election of Joseph R. Biden as president, there is speculation that the federal government may move to amend parts of the CSA and de-schedule cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug.
 
In late January, 2021, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers are in the process of merging various cannabis bills, including his own legalization legislation. He is working to enact reform in this Congressional session. This would include the Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act, that would federally de-schedule cannabis, reinvest tax revenue into communities most affected by the drug war, and fund efforts to expunge prior cannabis records. It is likely that the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE) Act would be incorporated.
 
Other federal legislation under review for possible submission includes the SAFE Banking Act (or Secure and Fair Enforcement Act), a bill that would allow cannabis companies to access the federally insured banking system and capital markets without the risk of federal enforcement action, and the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act (or STATES Act), a bill that seeks protections for businesses and individuals in states that have legalized and comply with state laws).

As of the date of this filing, cannabis remains an illegal Schedule 1 drug under the CSA and none of the legislative initiatives being discussed have become federal law.
 
Notably with respect to our business, on November 1, 2019, Colorado Bill HB-19-1090, was passed and made effective. This law allows publicly traded corporations to apply for and qualify for the ownership of Colorado cannabis licenses. Other states that have legalized cannabis for recreational and/or medicinal use restrict public companies from owning interests in state cannabis licenses altogether, or have enacted regulations which make it difficult for corporations to comply with application requirements, including all shareholders submitting to and passing background checks.
 
On September 18, 2020, Colorado’s Marijuana Enforcement Division (MED), approved the Company’s application for suitability, establishing the Company as one of the few publicly traded companies authorized to acquire and operate various cannabis licenses throughout Colorado, in both the recreational and medical markets.

Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our services and products throughout the United States in states that have implemented regulated cannabis programs as well as Canada. We intend to expand our offerings to more countries, states and jurisdictions as they adopt state-regulated or Federal programs.
Research and Development
 
As a component of our equipment and supplies offerings, from time-to-time we design and develop our own proprietary products to meet demand in markets where current offerings are insufficient. These products include, but are not limited to: The Satchel™, Cultivation Cube™, So-Hum Living Soils™ and the HDCS™. Costs associated with the development of new products are expensed as occurred as research and development operating expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 our research and development costs were de minimis.
Significant Customers
 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, nine customers accounted for 50.1% of the Company’s total revenues from its consulting and soil and product revenue lines for the period. As of December 31, 2020, three customers accounted for 84.21% of the Company’s total revenues.
 
At December 31, 2021, two customers accounted for 77.3% of accounts receivable, net. Accounts Receivable, net consist of customers of our consulting services and soil and products revenue streams. At December 31, 2020, three customers accounted for 84.21% of accounts receivables, net.

On March 29, 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued patent number 9,296,524 B2 for The Satchel™, our child-proof exit package solution for the regulated cannabis industry. We also have trademark applications pending to protect our branding and logos. These pending applications included trademarks for American Cannabis Company (stylized and/or with design logo), American Cannabis Consulting (stylized and/or with design logo), the design and colors used in our leaf logo, the Cultivation Cube (stylized and/or with design logo), our slogan (“Growing the Next Frontier”), and two-word marks and the logo associated with So-Hum Living Soil™.

Competition
-----------

 
Our competitors include professional services firms and cannabis dispensaries in the regulated cannabis and hemp industries, as well as suppliers of equipment and supplies commonly utilized in the cultivation, processing, or retail sale of cannabis and hemp. We compete in markets where cannabis and hemp has been legalized and regulated, which includes various states within the United States, it’s territories and Indian Country therein and Canada. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the cannabis and hemp industries mature. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new states and geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate cannabis and hemp products. We believe that by being well established in the industry, our experience and success to date, and our continued expansion of service and product offerings in new and existing locations, are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our operations and results.
 

Employees
---------

 
As of December 31, 2021, we have 7 full-time employees in our Denver headquarters, and 7 full time and 7 part time employees, in our Colorado Springs, Colorado dispensaries and cultivation facility. None of our U.S employees are represented by a labor union.
