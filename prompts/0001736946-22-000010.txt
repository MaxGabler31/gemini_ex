Item 1. Business
Overview 
Arlo Technologies, Inc. (“we”, “Arlo” or the “Company”) combines an intelligent cloud infrastructure and mobile app with a variety of smart connected devices that is transforming the way people experience the connected lifestyle. Arlo’s deep expertise in product design, wireless connectivity, cloud infrastructure and cutting-edge AI capabilities focuses on delivering a seamless, smart home experience for Arlo users that is easy to setup and interact with 
every day. Our cloud-based platform provides users with visibility, insight and a powerful means to help protect and connect in real-time with the people and things that matter most, from any location with a Wi-Fi or a cellular connection. To date, we have launched several categories of award-winning smart connected devices, including wired and wire-free smart Wi-Fi and LTE-enabled cameras, audio and video doorbells, and floodlight cameras. In addition, Arlo’s broad compatibility allows the platform to seamlessly integrate with third-party internet-of-things (“IoT”) products and protocols, such as Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Apple TV, Google Assistant, IFTTT, Stringify and Samsung SmartThings. Since the launch of our first product in December 2014, we have shipped over 22.9 million smart connected devices, and, as of December 31, 2021, our smart platform had approximately 6.1 million cumulative registered accounts across more than 100 countries around the world. We plan to continue to introduce new smart connected devices to the Arlo platform both in cameras and new categories, increase the number of registered accounts on our platform, keep them highly engaged through our mobile app and generate incremental recurring revenue by offering them paid subscription services. 
Market
Our total addressable market consists of individuals and business owners who use connected devices to enhance their lives. Outside of the home, we have seen adoption of our cellular-enabled products in a variety of use cases, such as neighborhood watch, construction site monitoring, wildlife and outdoor trail surveillance and event monitoring. We believe the small business, government and direct home monitoring channels provide growth areas for us in addition to our retail and e-commerce presence. In early 2020, we launched Arlo SmartCloud ("Arlo Smart") a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) solution to deliver scalable security cloud services for business. With Arlo SmartCloud, we are extending our platform to partners to help innovate and deploy new opportunities beyond our own camera ecosystem. In the third quarter of 2021, we introduced Arlo Secure, our new service plan with coverage for unlimited cameras and an enhanced Emergency Response solution. Arlo Secure replaced Arlo Smart, our previous service plan. Existing Arlo Smart customers are entitled to either retain their existing plans or upgrade to the new Arlo Secure plans of their choosing. We believe we are well-positioned to extend our current reach to the broader connected lifestyle market both within and beyond the home as we continue to launch new products and services within our connected lifestyle platform.

•The Devices screen provides a quick at-a-glance dashboard of the user’s devices linked to their account, with valuable status icons like device battery life, and actionable buttons to live stream from their Arlo camera, call e911, activate a siren, or access the device’s settings. 
•The Library screen delivers a timeline view of recorded video clips in the user’s Arlo Smart account, with additional tagging of clips that contain subject matter identified by Arlo Smart’s AI- and CV-based object detection, such as person, package, vehicle or even animal. 
•The Mode screen enables users to quickly Arm or Disarm their Arlo system. 
•The Settings screen provides access to additional device or account level information and features, including customization of Arlo Smart notifications and detection capabilities.

Agreements with Verisure 
On November 4, 2019, we concurrently entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) and Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement” and together with the Purchase Agreement, the “Verisure Agreements”) with Verisure. Verisure is a leading European provider of professionally monitored security systems with 24/7 response services to both residential and small business customers. The Verisure Agreements created a strategic partnership that leverages both the Company and Verisure’s capabilities to create incremental scale to address the ever-growing demand for residential and commercial security. The strategic partnership will combine our innovative connected cameras and cloud services platform with Verisure’s professionally monitored security solutions to provide a new level of smart security for European customers.
The Purchase Agreement provided that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, we transferred, sold and assigned to Verisure certain assets (the "Assets") related to our commercial operations in Europe (the "Business") to Verisure for $50.0 million in cash plus additional cash for certain inventory. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties regarding Verisure, the Business and the Assets, indemnification provisions, termination rights and other customary provisions. Further, we agreed not to engage in any business that competes with the Business for a period of three years. 
Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Supply Agreement, Verisure is the exclusive distributor of our products in Europe for all channels, and will non-exclusively distribute our products through its direct channels globally in connection with Verisure’s security business. During the five-year period commencing January 1, 2020, Verisure has an aggregate purchase commitment of $500.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, $160.1 million of the purchase commitment has been fulfilled. On December 30, 2019, Verisure prepaid $20.0 million for product purchases in fiscal 2020 and on December 21, 2020, Verisure prepaid $40.0 million for product purchases in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.
The Supply Agreement also provides for certain development services to Verisure under the Non-recurring Engineering ("NRE") arrangement, including development of certain custom products specified by Verisure, in exchange for an aggregate of $10.0 million, payable in installments upon meeting certain development milestones. In the second fiscal quarter of 2020, an additional $3.5 million was added to the contract price as a result of a modification to Verisure's specification for an Outdoor Custom Camera being developed.
As part of the Purchase Agreement, we also entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Verisure ("Verisure TSA") to assist Verisure with the transition of the Company’s European commercial operations. These transition services primarily include IT support and other services, including sales and marketing, operations and supply chain, finance, legal, and human resources. As compensation for these transition services, we will be reimbursed by Verisure based on actual direct costs plus allocation of overhead.
Competition 
We believe we are well-positioned to compete within the broader connected lifestyle market, both within and beyond the home as we continue to launch new product lines and services within our smart platform. However, our market is highly competitive and evolving, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products include price, service offerings, functionality, brand, technology, design, distribution channels and customer service.
We believe that we compete favorably in these areas on the basis of our market leadership position in the U.S. consumer network connected camera systems market, best-in-class technology, direct relationship with users and user engagement, trusted Arlo platform, strong Arlo brand and channel partners and deep strategic partnerships with key suppliers, such as Cypress Semiconductor Co., OmniVision Technologies Inc. and Qualcomm Incorporated. Moreover, our focus on building a connected lifestyle platform, combined with our leadership in innovation in the consumer network connected camera systems market, has led to the strength of our Arlo brand worldwide. We believe this focus allows us to compete favorably with companies that have introduced or have announced plans to introduce devices with connected lifestyle functionalities. Nevertheless, the connected lifestyle market remains highly competitive, and has a multitude of participants, including: large global technology companies, such as Amazon (Ring and Blink) and Google (Nest); security service vendors, such as ADT; telecom service providers, such as AT&T and Comcast; and smaller point product companies. 
Many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. We anticipate that current and potential competitors will also intensify their efforts to penetrate our target markets. For additional information, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and to be competitive we may be required to lower our prices or increase our sales and marketing expenses, which could result in reduced margins and loss of market share.” 
Research and Development 
We are passionate about developing new and innovative products and services that enable the connected lifestyle. Our research and development team collaborates with our product team to design and build differentiated new products and improve upon our existing products and services. Our goal is to create unique user experiences within the connected lifestyle. For example, our original Arlo camera was the world’s first commercially available 100% battery-operated Wi-Fi security camera with 720p HD video, IP65-rated weather resistance and night vision. The groundbreaking nature of the product, first launched in December 2014, gathered critical acclaim and market success. Our research and development team has taken this same approach to all of our subsequent product releases, constantly innovating to stay ahead of the competition. 
As of December 31, 2021, our research and development staff consisted of 131 employees, located in our offices worldwide, and was comprised of front-end and back-end software engineers, radio frequency engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, system test engineers, computer vision scientists and data analysis engineers, UX and industrial design engineers and mobile app developers. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to expand our platform and capabilities in the future. 
Manufacturing
While all of our products are primarily designed in North America, we currently outsource manufacturing to Foxconn Cloud Network Technology Singapore Pte. Ltd., Pegatron Corporation, and Wistron NeWeb Corporation, which are all headquartered in Asia. Although we do not have any long-term purchase contracts, we have executed master product supply agreements with these manufacturers, which typically provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement, epidemic failure clauses, agreed-upon price concessions, division of each party’s intellectual property and product quality requirements. As we expand our product portfolio, we continue to explore new potential manufacturing 
partners that may provide us with competitive advantages on technology and cost. Since we outsource our manufacturing, we have the flexibility and ability to adapt to market changes, product supply and component pricing while keeping our costs low. In addition to their responsibility for the manufacturing of our products, our manufacturers typically purchase all necessary parts and materials to produce finished goods. To maintain quality standards for our suppliers, we have established our own product quality organization based in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, and mainland China, which is responsible for auditing and inspecting process and product quality on the premises of our manufacturers. Our strategic relationships with our manufacturers are an important component of our ability to introduce new products and grow our business.
We focus on driving alignment of our product roadmaps with our manufacturers and determining what we can do collectively to reduce costs across the supply chain. Our operations teams based in the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia and mainland China coordinate with our manufacturers’ engineering, manufacturing and quality control personnel to develop the requisite manufacturing processes, quality checks and testing and general oversight of the manufacturing activities. We believe this model has enabled us to quickly and efficiently deliver high-quality and innovative products, while enabling us to minimize costs and manage inventory. 
Our products are manufactured and packaged for retail sale by our manufacturers mostly in Vietnam and Indonesia, with minimal manufacturers in China, and shipped to our logistics hubs located in the United States, Hong Kong and Australia. Our operations team coordinates with our manufacturers to ensure that the shipment of our products from the manufacturers to these logistics hubs meets customer demand. 
Marketing 
Our marketing programs are focused on building global brand awareness, increasing product adoption and driving sales. Our marketing efforts target individuals interested in a connected lifestyle. We also increase brand awareness by augmenting word-of-mouth recommendations from Arlo customers and key influencers, interact digitally with current and prospective customers and maintain and develop our strong channel partnerships and strong shelf presence. We collaborate with our retail partners on market development activities to drive in-store and online engagement with the brand and drive purchases. 
Customer Care 
We provide customer care to Arlo users globally through a variety of communication channels, including phone, chat, email, social media and our Arlo Community, as well as self-guided resources such as knowledge-base articles, how-to videos and technical documentation on our website. We believe that providing timely, responsive customer support and educational content to our users helps foster an ongoing engagement that builds loyalty to our brand and also enables Arlo to understand user needs as they evolve. The online Arlo Community in particular serves as an efficient and engaging platform through which we can deliver customer care and receive feedback from users. We gather and analyze user feedback from all platforms to help inform our design and engineering teams about future enhancements to our products and services. 
In order to best serve our users globally, we manage and continually adjust our resources worldwide through a mixture of permanent employees and subcontracted, outsourced resources. As our installed base continues to grow in new geographies, new categories and technologies, we will continue to focus on building a scalable support infrastructure that enables our users to engage with us through the channel that is most convenient and efficient for their needs. 
Arlo Cloud Engineering Operations 
We currently serve our users from third-party data center hosting facilities. Our cloud platform runs in data centers in the United States and a data center in Ireland to serve our European Union users. We also utilize data centers in Singapore and Australia. We have designed our cloud environments to be highly resilient with built-in redundancy and provide failover to other data centers in our network. 
Fiscal periods 
Our fiscal year begins on January 1 of the year stated and ends on December 31 of the same year. We report our results on a fiscal quarter basis rather than on a calendar quarter basis. Under the fiscal quarter basis, each of the first three fiscal quarters ends on the Sunday closest to the calendar quarter end, with the fourth quarter ending on December 31. 
Seasonality
Historically, we have generated higher product revenue in the third and fourth quarters of each year compared to the first and second quarters due to seasonal demand from consumer markets, primarily relating to the beginning of the school year and the holiday season. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our third and fourth quarters collectively represented 58.4%, 63.0% and 61.8%, respectively, of our revenue for such years. Therefore, timely and effective product introductions are critical to our results of operations.
Backlog 
Our backlog consists of products for which customer purchase orders have been received and that are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment. As of December 31, 2021, we had a backlog of $4.4 million, compared to $5.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and $5.4 million as of December 31, 2019. As we typically fulfill orders received within a relatively short period after receipt, our revenue in any fiscal year depends primarily upon orders booked and the availability of supply of our products in that year. In addition, most of our backlog is subject to rescheduling or cancellation with minimal penalties. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date may not be an indicator of revenue for any succeeding period. Similarly, there is a lack of meaningful correlation between year-over-year changes in backlog as compared with year-over-year changes in revenue. Accordingly, we do not believe that backlog information is material to an understanding of our overall business, and backlog as of any particular date should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to protect our intellectual property will be an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Some of our technology relies upon third-party licensed intellectual property. 
We currently hold 95 issued United States patents, 45 pending United States patent applications, 23 international patents, including patents issued by China and the EU, 22 pending patent applications outside of the United States. All the patents and patent applications generally relate to certain aspects of our hardware devices, accessories, software and services. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. 
We also pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We currently have seven registered trademarks and three pending trademark applications in the United States, as well as 49 registered trademarks and 22 pending trademark applications outside of the United States. We currently hold trademark registrations for “ARLO” in ten countries: the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago, as well as the World Intellectual Property Organization. For more information, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-If we are unable to secure and protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete could be harmed.” 
Environmental Laws 
Our products and manufacturing processes are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which cover both the use of various materials and environmental concerns. Environmental issues such as pollution and climate change have had significant legislative and regulatory efforts on a global basis, and there are expected to be additional changes to the regulations in these areas. These changes could directly increase the cost of energy, which may have an impact on the way we manufacture products. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of the raw materials we use in our products and the cost of compliance. Other regulations in the environmental area may require us to continue to monitor and ensure proper disposal or recycling of our products. To the best of our knowledge, we maintain compliance with all current government regulations concerning our production processes for all locations in which we operate. Since we operate on a global basis, this is also a complex process that requires continual monitoring of regulations and an ongoing compliance process to ensure that we and our suppliers are in compliance with all existing regulations.
Culture and Human Capital Resources
Our culture, mission and values are a critical part of our success. In fact, core to our vision of bringing peace of mind by connecting and protecting what people care about the most is creating the right environment for our people. We strive to ensure that our employees are continually connected to our vision and mission through appropriate communication, throughout our talent proposition and as we serve our customers. 
Our culture focuses on connecting our people in an inclusive and flexible workforce, connecting our employees with the right development opportunities, and linking our group success with individual performance. It is founded on an employee value proposition that puts people and teams at the center of our business. Through radical collaboration, trust, and conscious leadership, our diverse teams continue to create innovative solutions for our customers. 
We protect our culture through leadership excellence and developing the right leadership behaviors that are both conscious and strategic in their impact on our performance. We value creativity, agility, hard work, transparency, and integrity, as we focus on continually innovating and improving our technology, solutions, brand, and partnerships. 
Human capital measures and objectives used to manage our business focus on employee safety and wellness, talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development and training, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. We strive to attract and retain exceptionally talented, diverse, and ethical employees, and we are proud of the culture we have built. Our talented employees, located throughout the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia, and Europe communicate, connect and work together to deliver a world-class end-to-end connected lifestyle solution. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and we have not experienced any labor disputes. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 353 full-time employees, of which approximately 69% were based in the United States, and approximately 31% were based in other global regions.
Diversity and Inclusion
Arlo is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and an affirmative action employer. We always strive to treat all employees and job applicants based on merit, qualifications, personality, and talent, and to draw from a diverse candidate pool as we recruit new talent across all levels. We deeply connect people from all backgrounds and beliefs and strive for a truly inclusive and collaborative working environment. 
We have taken action alongside a group of more than 1,200 businesses in a collective commitment to make progress towards advancing diversity and inclusion in our workplace, communities, and country. We value diversity and integrate it into our business by striving to ensure that our company is representative of the customers we serve and that inclusion is at the core of our workplace culture. In 2020, our Chief Executive Officer signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion within the workplace 
to underscore our commitment. By making the pledge, we go beyond accepting diversity and committed to the following actions: 
•Continue to cultivate our workplace to support open dialogue on complex, and sometimes difficult conversations about diversity and inclusion.
•Make unconscious bias education available to everyone.
•Share best known—and unsuccessful—actions.
•Create and share strategic inclusion and diversity plans with our board of directors as a way to prioritize diversity and inclusion and to drive accountability in our organization. 
For the second year running, we are partnering with the GEM Consortium ("GEM"). GEM connects highly qualified students from underrepresented groups to STEM graduate programs with much-needed financial support that is often the deciding factor in pursuing graduate education. We have welcomed a number of GEM interns at Arlo.
We host a number of events and days of observance with guest and internal speakers at Arlo. Each Spring, for example, we hold a "Week of Understanding" with speakers on key diversity and inclusion topics. These events provide a platform for dialogue and an opportunity for every employee to learn, discuss, and appreciate differences between colleagues as we grow to drive greater inclusion at Arlo and truly reflect the customers we serve.
COVID-19 and Employee Safety
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our primary focus has been on the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. Our global pandemic efforts include implementing early and continuous updates to our health and safety policies and processes, migrating all but a limited number of our global workforce to work remotely while local and state governments have imposed shelter-in-place orders in the United States and around the world. We are focused on providing our team with the resources that they need to meet the needs of our customers and deliver new innovations to the markets we serve, despite challenges introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic continues, the health and well-being of our workforce remains our top priority while we ensure productivity while working from home.
