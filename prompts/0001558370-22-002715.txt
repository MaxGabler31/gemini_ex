Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a precision oncology company focused on the development of targeted therapeutics for the treatment of cancer in genomically defined patient populations. Our vision is to elevate precision medicine to the forefront of every cancer treatment journey, as we believe that each patient living with cancer deserves the opportunity to benefit from a genomically-driven treatment decision. We utilize our deep expertise in developing drugs for rare, genomically defined patient populations and strategic collaborations with our diagnostic collaborators to work towards a future where each tumor’s unique genomic test result can be matched with a purpose-built precision medicine.
We are focused on identifying oncogenic drivers that are known to be predominantly mutually exclusive with other driver alterations, and pursuing innovations and efficiencies in the conduct of clinical trials that we believe may enable development of targeted therapeutics against those oncogenic drivers.
Our lead drug development candidate, seribantumab, is an Anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody and potential novel targeted therapy for solid tumors driven by neuregulin-1, or NRG1 fusions, a type of genomic alteration and oncogenic driver, and other receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-, or HER3, genomically defined cancers. We have designed and initiated our registration-directed Phase 2 CRESTONE clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of seribantumab in advanced solid tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion. We expect to complete enrollment of the first 20 patients in Cohort 1 of the CRESTONE study in mid-2022, and to present initial clinical data from approximately 10 patients from Cohort 1 of the CRESTONE study treated with seribantumab at 3 grams weekly at a major medical meeting in mid-2022.
We also plan to expand our drug development pipeline beyond seribantumab into additional genomically defined cancers by leveraging our value-driving partnerships with Caris Life Sciences and others, as well as by exploring further opportunities to selectively partner on additional precision oncology assets. 
We are managed by a team with significant experience and track records for clinical and commercial execution in the oncology space and backed by a group of renowned scientific advisors and partners that bring diagnostic, clinical, and operational expertise to help optimize execution. 
Our strategy
Our goal is to deliver safe and effective therapies for genomically defined patient populations with significant unmet clinical needs. Key elements of our strategy include:

● | Implement an innovative operational model tailored to the efficient development and potential regulatory approval of precision therapeutics for rare, genomically defined cancers, beginning with the investigation of seribantumab for any solid tumor driven by an NRG1 fusion. We have designed our business model around genomically defined cancers with smaller trial size requirements and the potential for accelerated approval. Rather than follow the traditional drug discovery path, we have focused on external development to identify potential assets that we can acquire at attractive economic terms and that will enable us to move efficiently through clinical development. We acquired seribantumab in July 2019 as a Phase 2-ready asset, enabling us to move rapidly into a potentially registration-directed Phase 2 trial. We have also employed innovative models to enhance traditional patient enrollment into our clinical trials, with opportunity for enrollment not only at core sites, but also through referrals through our diagnostic partnerships, and a “just-in-time” site initiation model. This enables us to reduce overhead costs for a trial and increase the availability of eligible patients, addressing two key risks in the development of therapies for rare, genomically defined patient populations.

● | Prioritize oncogenic drivers that are predominantly mutually exclusive oncogenic alterations to maximize the probability of clinical success. We focus on oncogenic driver events that are most often mutually exclusive within a tumor, meaning that co-expression with other known driver alterations is not observed. We believe that

our ability to identify and specifically target a mutually exclusive oncogenic driver alteration increases the likelihood of developing a therapy that achieves a clinical benefit for patients as a monotherapy. Our lead program focuses on NRG1 gene fusions in solid tumors, which are oncogenic drivers that are predominantly mutually exclusive with other known genomic alterations. The identification of NRG1 fusions in more than ten solid tumor types may enable a tumor-agnostic development approach.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rapidly advance our lead product candidate seribantumab, a monoclonal antibody, through late-stage clinical development for solid tumors harboring NRG1 gene fusions. In July 2020, we initiated the CRESTONE trial a Phase 2 clinical trial at sites across the United States, Canada, and Australia to assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of seribantumab in patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion. We are conducting the CRESTONE trial with the intent to seek regulatory approval through the accelerated approval pathway, pending continued discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Given its mechanism of action and broad therapeutic window, we believe that seribantumab has the potential to effect robust and durable responses at a dosing regimen optimized for patients with solid tumors driven by an NRG1 fusion.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Collaborate with diagnostic providers and next-generation sequencing, or NGS, centers of excellence to accelerate enrollment in clinical trials by identifying patients with rare, genomically defined cancers, starting with solid tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion. We have entered into agreements with multiple partners selected for their ability to identify NRG1 gene fusions with high sensitivity, particularly through the use of RNA-based next generation sequencing. Through these collaborations, we are able to expand identification of patients who may be eligible for enrollment in our Phase 2 CRESTONE trial beyond those patients who may be identified through traditional clinical trial site enrollment processes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand our pipeline of drug candidates targeted against oncogenic driver alterations through strategic collaborations and/or external development. We intend to continue expanding our pipeline by leveraging our partnerships with next-generation sequencing, or NGS diagnostic providers, as well as our own internal expertise and capabilities, to potentially accelerate the identification of additional actionable oncogenic targets. We then expect to in-license, acquire or discover assets with potential against those identified oncogenic driver targets. Through our collaboration with Caris Life Sciences, we continually assess oncogenic fusions and driver mutations identified through our partner’s screening capabilities to identify potential targets and then elect to initiate a novel drug discovery program for those targets or evaluate existing therapeutics for potential in-licensing or product acquisition, while retaining exclusive access to all targets selected by the parties.

● | Evaluate strategic opportunities to potentially accelerate development timelines and enhance the commercial potential of our product candidates globally. We intend to build an integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on precision oncology with a broad portfolio of targeted therapies. We currently retain full global development and commercialization rights for seribantumab. We plan to commercialize our product candidates in key markets, either alone or with strategic partners, as well as invest in shaping the genomic testing landscape in order to maximize the worldwide commercial potential of our programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Actively advocate for and participate in industry-wide initiatives to improve access, awareness, and clarity around precision medicines for rare, genomically defined cancers. We envision a future where every patient with cancer has the option of a precision therapy matched to their tumor’s unique genomic driver. This begins with ensuring the wide availability of genomic testing to identify the increasing number of biomarkers that can be paired with an investigational clinical trial or a commercially available targeted therapy. We aim to increase awareness on the importance of applying the appropriate diagnostic testing method for each actionable driver alteration by collaborating with academic institutions, patient advocacy groups, medical education providers and associations, diagnostic companies, and community oncology practices to advocate for broad genomic testing of tumors, at all lines of therapy, and regardless of the stage of cancer. By comprehensively identifying all actionable genomic driver alterations present at each treatment decision timepoint, patients may dynamically benefit from the prognostic and therapeutically predictive value of diagnostic tests as both their tumor and the treatment landscape evolve. Finally, we advocate for industry-wide initiatives that remove the burden of

responsibility from the patient to educate themselves, and move towards presenting a clear, united message that prioritizes patient benefit and well-being.

Background
The rise of precision cancer therapeutics
Cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases caused by alterations in cells that give rise to abnormal cell growth and proliferation. Many cancer therapeutics rely on the rapid growth dynamics of cancer cells to elicit a therapeutic effect; notably, most chemotherapeutics inhibit the replication of all cells in the body, but act preferentially to destroy cancer cells as they proliferate faster than non-cancer cells, resulting in significant toxicity. By contrast, targeted therapies are designed to interfere with, or target, the specific pathways within a cancer cell that contribute to the growth and survival of a tumor, while minimizing systemic adverse events.
Cancer has also historically been diagnosed, classified, and in large part, treated based on a tumor’s organ site or tissue of origin, thus giving rise to therapeutics for lung cancer, breast cancer or other tissue-based designations. With advances in genomic testing, there has been widespread recognition that cancers may be defined by their unique genomic signatures, instead of tissue of origin, due to shared genomic alterations irrespective of their location in the body. This understanding has both been a result of, and driven by, an increased use of genomic sequencing to better understand the driving factors of each individual cancer. Over the last several years, the ability to conduct genomic profiling of an individual patient’s tumor has become more readily accessible and affordable. Our collective understanding of the genomic makeup of tumors has facilitated the development of precision therapeutics designed to specifically inhibit the underlying causes of tumor growth and proliferation.
The precision oncology movement strives to improve patient outcomes by identifying the underlying oncogenic driver of each tumor through genomic testing and by matching it to a purpose-built targeted therapeutic. By precisely matching a therapeutic to a tumor’s genomic driver of disease, the hope is to achieve a deeper and more durable response with fewer off-target side effects for every cancer — no matter how rare.
Genomic alterations fall on a spectrum of oncogenic potential
Cancer arises through a process whereby cells acquire a series of alterations that eventually precipitate unrestrained cell growth and division. The changes that accumulate in a cancer cell may encompass many distinct classes of genomic alterations, including overexpression or amplification of individual genes, specific point mutations in a single gene, and chromosomal translocations or fusions of genetic material.
These genomic alterations can be further characterized as driver or passenger alterations that fall on a spectrum of oncogenic potential. Oncogenic driver alterations confer growth and survival advantages to the cancer cells that may lead to oncogenesis and continued growth of a tumor. Passenger mutations, also known as bystander mutations, are those that arise within the cancer cell but are not the primary or underlying cause of oncogenesis and/or continued growth of a tumor.
Advances in genomic testing, including increases in the specificity and sensitivity of testing methods, have enabled improved identification of a wider range of genomic alterations. In particular, advancements in and wider availability of RNA-based NGS whole transcriptome sequencing has improved our ability to identify novel gene fusions. These “chimeric” genes arise from the re-combination of portions of two normally unrelated genes and are transcribed into corresponding fusion proteins which may retain functionalities related to either or both component proteins. If a tumor suppressor gene or oncogene is involved, the resulting fusion proteins frequently lead to unregulated cell growth and proliferation and are often the primary cause of tumor growth.
While gene fusions are generally rare, they have high oncogenic potential. Most importantly, they can appear in tumors as oncogenic drivers, predominantly mutually exclusive with any other known genomic driver alteration. Accordingly, these fusions represent important genomic alterations to identify and subsequently target with a precision therapy.

NRG1 fusions and HER3 inhibition
The ERBB family of proteins contains four members including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ERBB1; HER1), ERBB2 (HER2), ERBB3 (HER3), and ERBB4 (HER4). While EGFR, HER2, and HER4 are tyrosine kinases, HER3 is a pseudo-kinase meaning that HER3 does not have meaningful catalytic activity of its own.
When HER3 is activated by its ligand, NRG1, it undergoes an obligate pairing through homo- or heterodimerization with HER2 or other ERBB family members. The formation of these HER3-HER2 dimers and other ERBB family complexes leads to the downstream activation of PI3-Kinase and AKT, or PI3K/AKT as well as MAP-Kinase, or MAPK, key pathways that regulate cell growth and proliferation.
Alterations that disrupt signaling of ERBB and downstream signaling pathways through PI3K/AKT and MAPK are often identified in tumors.
Tumorigenesis driven by NRG1 fusions
NRG1 gene fusions are rare genomic alterations that arise when portions of the NRG1 gene are combined with portions of a second gene, known as its fusion partner. NRG1 gene fusions are transcribed by a cell into NRG1 fusion proteins. As long as the NRG1 portion of the fusion protein retains its active component, known as the EGF-like domain, the fusion protein can act like a normal NRG1 protein, and can induce signaling through the HER3 receptor. Based on current literature, it appears that nearly all NRG1 fusions contain the genomic region that encodes the EGF-like domain of the protein and therefore are able to bind to HER3 and activate downstream signaling pathways.
Production of the wild-type NRG1 protein is normally tightly regulated by a cell to prevent uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Cells may not be able to regulate the aberrant NRG1 fusion proteins in the same way, and their production may lead to over-activation of HER3 and downstream PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways leading to tumor growth and proliferation (Figure 1).
​
Figure 1. NRG1 fusions drive tumor growth & proliferation through HER3.

Figure 1. [Left] The NRG1 gene encodes the NRG1 protein, which is a ligand for HER3. Ligand-induced activation of HER3 by NRG1 enables preferential dimerization with HER2 and activation of downstream PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Production of the NRG1 protein is tightly regulated by the cell to avoid overactivation of downstream pathways. [Right] Portions of the NRG1 gene may be aberrantly combined with portions of an unrelated gene, resulting in an NRG1 gene fusion. The resulting NRG1 fusion proteins may still act as ligands for HER3 if they retain an intact EGF-like domain. Cells may not be able to regulate production of NRG1 fusion proteins, leading to tumor growth and proliferation driven by overactivation of HER3 and downstream PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways.
Characteristics of NRG1 fusions
NRG1 fusion proteins contain components of both the NRG1 protein and the protein described by its fusion partner. At least 50% of known NRG1 fusions contain CD74, ATP1B1, SDC4, or RBPM5 as the fusion partner. It is not known at this time if there are any prognostic or functional differences between NRG1 fusions with different partners.
Importantly, when NRG1 fusions are found in a tumor, other known oncogenic drivers such as KRAS, EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and RET mutations are typically absent. Because of this, NRG1 fusions are considered oncogenic driver alterations given they are predominantly mutually exclusive when detected in patients with cancer. As a mutually exclusive oncogenic driver, we believe a targeted monotherapy approach has a strong potential to treat tumors that harbor an NRG1 fusion.
Incidence of NRG1 fusions
To our knowledge, the most comprehensive assessment of the incidence rate of NRG1 fusions was published in 2019 by Jonna et al. in Clinical Cancer Research with an analysis of 21,858 samples and updated at the 2020 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, based on an updated analysis of 44,570 tumor samples. Based on the observed incidence rate of approximately 0.2% and the estimated number of new cancer cases in the United States in 2020 reported in Cancer Facts and Figures 2020 by the American Cancer Society, we estimate the incidence of new patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion in the United States is approximately 3,200 per year.
​
NRG1 fusions have been identified in more than ten unique solid tumor types to date in the published literature, and we expect that the reported number of tumor types harboring an NRG1 fusion will grow as research continues to advance. Separate reports in the published literature suggest that the prevalence of NRG1 fusions may be enriched in specific tumor subtypes; prevalence in invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, or IMA, a subtype of NSCLC, has been reported to be up to 27-31%; prevalence in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a subtype of pancreatic cancer, has been reported to be up to 6%.
The wide range of tumor types in which an NRG1 fusion has been identified make it a strong candidate for a tumor-agnostic development strategy.
NRG1 fusions lead to a poor prognosis
There are currently no approved therapeutics specifically targeting tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion. Evidence available to date suggests that patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion have a poor prognosis and limited response to currently available therapies. 
​
A research report published in Oncotarget in 2016 by Shin et al. presented an analysis of disease-free survival, or DFS, and overall survival, or OS, in patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion. In all patients analyzed (n=59) the presence of an NRG1 fusion resulted in inferior OS and a trend towards shorter DFS, compared to those without NRG1 fusions. To remove the confounding factor of stage of disease, a sub analysis was done on patients with stage 1 disease (n=45) where patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion showed significantly inferior OS and DFS as compared to those with tumors without an NRG1 fusion.
​
A 2021 Journal of Clinical Oncology report by Drilon et al. reported an analysis from a global multicenter network of thoracic oncologists participating in an NRG1 fusion global registry trial, who identified 110 NSCLC patients with

pathologically confirmed NRG1 fusions and evaluated their response to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, or off-label use of afatinib. They reported that 0-20% of patients achieved an objective response to platinum-doublet-based chemotherapy (n = 15), taxane-based chemotherapy (n = 7), immunotherapy (n = 5), or chemotherapy plus an immunotherapy (n = 9), and only 25% of patients achieved an objective response to off-label afatinib (n = 20). In this retrospective trial, it was determined that treatment with afatinib resulted in a median progression-free survival, or PFS, of 2.8 months. Limited durability is likely attributed to the fact that HER3 is a pseudo-kinase, and therefore inhibition of HER3 is not amenable to targeting by small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as afatinib, which inhibits EGFR, HER2, and HER4. Given afatinib does not inhibit HER3, only partial inhibition of downstream signaling (PI3K/AKT and MAPK) is observed, which allows tumor cells harboring an NRG1 fusion to continue to grow and proliferate.
Evidence that targeting HER3 may be an optimal approach for treating tumors harboring an NRG1 fusions
There have been several clinical case reports published or presented on the potential of ERBB-family inhibition as a therapeutic intervention for patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion. These include reports on the off-label use of afatinib as well as a few cases with monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors targeting ERBB family members. Clinical activity, including objective responses, have been reported with varying durations of response.
As reported by Drilon et al. in a 2018 report in Cancer Discovery, small molecule inhibition of EGFR, HER2, and HER4 with afatinib was not as effective as the use of HER3-targeted therapy. The administration of afatinib in an in vivo NRG1 fusion model of ovarian cancer (OV-10-0050) with a CLU-NRG1 fusion resulted in a mixed response to treatment. A potential reason for the limited effect of afatinib observed is that treatment with afatinib did not result in complete shutdown of downstream signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway. In contrast, the specific inhibition of HER3 by the anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody (GSK2849330) induced complete, or near-complete, regressions and a near-complete suppression of downstream signaling in the same model.
Additionally described in the report, the only response observed in the Phase 1 clinical trial of GSK2849330 was in a patient with a NSCLC tumor harboring an NRG1 fusion who had been treated previously with several lines of systemic therapy (chemotherapy and immune therapy) with no response to any of these treatments. Targeted therapy with the anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody GSK2849330 resulted in a durable partial response of 19 months, which exceeded the duration of disease control achieved on all prior systemic lines of therapy in aggregate.
Seribantumab was included as part of a case series presentation at the Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group 2021 Annual Scientific Meeting. A patient with treatment-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer had their tumor genomically profiled through the MoST program, was found to harbor an NRG1 fusion, and subsequently received treatment with seribantumab through a compassionate use program provided by Elevation Oncology. As of the data cut-off for the presentation, treatment with seribantumab resulted in durable clinical benefit for over 9 months, an approximately 90% reduction in the cancer biomarker CA19-9, and an ongoing 3 month confirmed partial response per RECIST criteria with a maximum tumor reduction of over 50%.
Our Approach
Our operational platform is designed for continued success by expanding on the promise of precision medicine and using the significant opportunities available to address multiple genomically defined cancers with first-in-class and best-in-class therapies. We are focused on developing drugs to target genomic alterations that are predominantly mutually exclusive with other known driver alterations. By targeting these unique oncogenic driver events and tailoring the best therapeutic approach, we believe we can increase the potential for therapeutic, clinical, and regulatory success in genomically defined patient populations. 
​
Target Identification
We have established industry-wide partnerships with NGS companies to enable the identification of actionable targets. We also collaborate with academic and clinical researchers, diagnostic leaders, and community oncology practices to evaluate emerging genomic research for potential targets.

Therapeutic Candidate Selection
Following target identification, we select attractive assets in a capital-efficient manner through a targeted search for the appropriate chemical matter to address the identified target. We start by assessing existing compounds based on their mechanistic properties, observed or predicted risk-benefit profile, chemical and manufacturing properties, intellectual property, and other parameters on a case-by-case basis. We then in-license, acquire, or when there is not suitable existing chemical matter, may embark upon a drug discovery campaign with collaborators to create an appropriate candidate for future drug development. These processes allow us to select the asset that we believe may have the highest probability of technical success for the treatment of patients with genomically defined cancers.
Optimized Clinical Trial and Regulatory Execution
We aim to drive operational success by implementing process innovations that we believe may enable us to efficiently advance product candidates through clinical development in genomically defined patient populations. Given these populations are often relatively rare, we have built an innovative clinical enrollment model that recognizes the importance and impact of each individual patient. We also seek to employ expedited regulatory strategies such as Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Fast Track Designation, Priority Review, Accelerated Approval, and other collaborative mechanisms with the FDA and regulatory agencies outside the United States to optimize clinical development where applicable. We utilize our robust network of strategic partnerships to enhance patient enrollment through real-time identification and referral of genomically defined patient populations into clinical studies. Patients can be enrolled through identification at, or active referral to, core trial sites at academic medical institutions, and new trial sites can be rapidly activated through a process of “just-in-time” site initiation through a network of specialized community oncology centers. We have executed multiple strategic collaborations to support just-in-time site initiation to date. For example, through collaborations with Caris Life Sciences, Tempus, and The US Oncology Network we currently have access to approximately 400 clinical trial sites globally in support of our Phase 2 CRESTONE trial.
Our Lead Program
Seribantumab for solid tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion
Our lead program targets a genomically defined patient population whose tumors are driven by NRG1 gene fusions and predominantly mutually exclusive with other known driver alterations. Following our focused approach described above:

● | We confirmed that NRG1 fusions are likely to be a clinically actionable biomarker and identified HER3 inhibition with a monoclonal antibody as a selective targeted therapeutic approach for tumors driven by an NRG1 fusion.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody seribantumab was specifically chosen as a therapeutic candidate with the potential to selectively target tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion and support an efficient development pathway as a Phase 2-ready asset.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We designed the Phase 2 CRESTONE trial with “just-in-time” site initiation and early review of response signals, which we believe addresses inefficiencies of clinical development within rare, genomically defined patient populations, and potentially enables submission of a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA pursuant to an accelerated approval pathway in the United States.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We acquired seribantumab (formerly MM-121) from the previous sponsor in July 2019 following robust evaluation of HER3 inhibitors and their potential for development specifically for patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion. The clinical development program of seribantumab by the previous sponsor was focused on patients with overexpression or amplification of HER3 or NRG1, with limited anti-tumor efficacy. Importantly, patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 gene fusion were not specifically selected for inclusion in these studies. We believe that patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion represent the most appropriate patient population to evaluate the potential of seribantumab and that our product candidate offers significant potential for efficacy in these patients.

11



We selected seribantumab for development in patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion, in part due to the following key characteristics.

● | Seribantumab’s unique mechanism of action inhibits ligand-dependent activation of HER3, and likely through the inhibition of ERBB dimerization, destabilizes the entire ERBB family of proteins.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Previous clinical studies in more than 800 patients demonstrating that seribantumab had been generally well tolerated in clinical trials with mostly Grade 1/2 adverse events.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to determine the predicted active dose of seribantumab from preclinical models of tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seribantumab’s favorable pharmacokinetic profile that we believe is well suited to optimized schedules and may provide a biologically effective dose in patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The manufacturing process for seribantumab has been shown to be commercially scalable.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Risks for development in genomically defined patient population have the potential to be addressed through the design of our Phase 2 CRESTONE trial of seribantumab.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mechanism of action
Seribantumab is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds to HER3 and competes with the NRG1 fusion protein, preventing activation of the HER3 signaling cascade that is believed to sustain proliferation and survival of tumor cells harboring an NRG1 fusion. NRG1 fusions may act as a ligand to HER3, allowing HER3 to dimerize to HER2 and other ERBB family members and subsequently over-activating the downstream PI3K/AKT and MAPK.
Seribantumab is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds to a unique epitope on HER3 that prevents the ligand-induced activation of HER3, as well as disrupts the ability of HER3 to dimerize with HER2, and to a lesser extent, the other ERBB family members EGFR and HER4. By inhibiting the dimerization of HER3 with other ERBB family members, seribantumab reduces the activation of these receptors in addition to the ligand-dependent activation of HER3, and subsequent activation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK, downstream signaling pathways that are commonly implicated in tumor growth and proliferation.
Previous sponsor’s Phase 1 monotherapy trial NCT00734305 (safety and pharmacokinetics)
The initial monotherapy trial conducted by the previous sponsor was a Phase 1 open label, dose escalation trial in which six cohorts of patients were enrolled followed by an expansion cohort using a maximum loading dose of 40 mg/kg followed by weekly dosing at 20 mg/kg. Overall, a total of 43 patients were exposed to seribantumab in this initial safety and pharmacology trial. The majority of adverse events observed in the monotherapy trial were transient and mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly reported adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 rash, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. There was one serious adverse event, or SAE, considered possibly related to seribantumab in trials conducted to date, a Grade 4 confusional state at the lowest dose level tested, 3.2 mg/kg. The event resolved after treatment discontinuation and no other dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, were reported in this or other dose escalation cohorts in the Phase 1 monotherapy study. A maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, was not determined in this trial.

Our preclinical characterization
We sponsored a series of preclinical studies to determine the in vitro and in vivo properties of seribantumab specifically in NRG1 fusion models, some of which were published by Odintsov et al. in Clinical Cancer Research in 2021. Experiments were conducted in NRG1 fusion models, including patient-derived xenograft, or PDX mouse models. 
Key findings from our preclinical testing of seribantumab include:

● | Inhibition of HER3 resulted in reduction of tumor growth in NRG1 fusion driven tumors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seribantumab reduced tumor growth to a greater extent than both clinically achievable and supra-clinical doses of afatinib in multiple NRG1 fusion models of cancer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seribantumab inhibited ligand-dependent activation of HER3 and phosphorylation of all other ERBB family members.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seribantumab inhibited HER3 dimerization with HER2 due to the unique epitope on HER3 to which seribantumab binds.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The active dose of seribantumab was determined and confirmed across multiple NRG1 fusion model.

Figure 2. [Left] Treatment of the LUAD0061AS3 cell line (which has an SLC3A2-NRG1 fusion) with seribantumab showed dose-dependent inhibition of HER3, HER2, EGFR, HER4, and AKT phosphorylation in vitro. [Middle] Treatment of a LUAD0061AS3 PDX model confirmed reduction of HER3 and HER2 phosphorylation as well as reduction of phosphorylation of downstream AKT and ERK following a single flat dose of seribantumab (0.6 mg, 0.75 mg or 1 mg) in vivo. Tumors were removed at 2-, 24-, or 168-hours post-drug administration, to determine impact on signaling activity over time. All doses of seribantumab resulted in reduced phosphorylation of HER2, HER3, AKT, and ERK1/2 by the 2h time point, with higher doses being more effective at the longer time points. However, at the 24h and 168h time points, reactivation of HER3, AKT and ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation was observed, despite consistent

Immunoprecipitation (IP) of HER3 was followed by immunoblot (IB, Western blot) analysis for HER2 or HER3. In this NRG1 fusion containing cell line, HER3-HER2 dimers were detected under serum-depleted conditions. Treatment with NRG1-ß1 ligand did not increase HER3-HER2 association beyond basal levels, suggesting near-maximum association. Reduced levels of HER2 in the HER3 precipitate extracted following treatment with seribantumab suggests that seribantumab is able to block HER3-HER2 dimerization.

Notably, this specimen was derived from a patient who had progressed after prior standard therapy and progression on afatinib therapy. In this trial, PDX tumors (approximately 3 mm3) were implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of immunodeficient mice. Treatment was initiated when the tumors reached a volume of 150-200 mm3. Each treatment group consisted of 7 mice while 5 mice were used in the vehicle control group. Treatment started on day 14 of the experiment and consisted of vehicle (PBS), seribantumab (0.6, 0.75 or 1 mg per dose BIW, or afatinib (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg QD). A dose-related decline in tumor volume was observed across all doses of seribantumab, with the best response observed with the 1 mg/kg dose where maximal tumor regression was approximately 60%. Afatinib was not associated with tumor regression at 5 mg/kg; however tumor regression of approximately 30% was observed at a dose of 15 mg/kg, which is approximately 3-fold higher than the clinically achievable dose of 40 mg/day in humans.

Figure 4. Preclinical proof of concept (in vivo):
Seribantumab drives near-complete tumor regression in an ovarian CLU-NRG1 fusion PDX model (OV-10-0050).
Figure 4: The OV-10-0050 PDX model was developed from an ovarian cancer specimen with a CLU-NRG1 fusion. Seribantumab at doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg BIW were tested. Near complete and complete tumor regressions were observed across the entire dose range, with complete tumor regressions observed in nearly all animals at the highest dose level of 10 mg BIW. Afatinib dosed at 5 mg/kg QD did not induce tumor regressions.
Based on the collective results from these studies, we believe that the active dose of seribantumab necessary to reduce HER3 and downstream ERBB signaling, reduce the growth of tumors, and extend the duration of response ranges from approximately 1 mg BIW and up to at least 10 mg BIW in these preclinical cancer models driven by an NRG1 fusion, which is approximately equivalent to a 260 mg - 2.6 g fixed dose in humans and well within the 3 gram weekly clinical dose of seribantumab. The inhibitory capability of seribantumab was evident in tumor types with different tissues of origin (lung and ovarian) and different NRG1 fusion partners (SLCA32-NRG1 and CLU-NRG1, respectively).
Optimized Clinical Trial and Regulatory Execution: Phase 2 Tumor-Agnostic CRESTONE trial (NCT04383210)
In July 2020, we initiated our Phase 2 CRESTONE trial following a Type C meeting with FDA as the first clinical trial of seribantumab in patients with solid tumors driven by an NRG1 fusion. 
The CRESTONE trial is as an open-label, international, multi-center, tumor-agnostic Phase 2 trial in adult patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that harbor an NRG1 gene fusion and have progressed after at least one prior line of standard therapy. Patients will be enrolled into one of three cohorts depending on prior treatments received and the presence or absence of an NRG1 fusion with intact EGF-like domain that is mutually exclusive with any other actionable molecular alteration. The trial is designed as a potentially registrational trial, contingent on continued discussions with the FDA.
A cohort design has been introduced to proactively control for innate biological variability in NRG1 fusions, such as impact of the expression of an intact EGF-like domain, as well as potential variability in response due to prior treatment with other inhibitors of the ERBB family. Cohort 1 is designated as the pivotal cohort and therefore has the most 

15



stringent eligibility criteria. Cohorts 2 and 3 are exploratory in nature, and not intended to contribute to the population supporting a potential registration application.
All patient tumors will be tested for an NRG1 fusion based on local CLIA-certified or similarly accredited lab testing of tumor tissue prior to initiating further screening procedures. All patients must have received at least one prior line of standard therapy.

● | Cohort 1 (Pivotal): At least 55 patients with a centrally confirmed NRG1 fusion who have not been previously treated with an EGFR-, HER2-, or HER3-directed therapy. Patients eligible for Cohort 1 must have a tumor with an NRG1 fusion with an intact EGF-like domain and no other known and actionable oncogenic driver alterations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cohort 2 (Exploratory): Up to ten patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion with an intact EGF-like domain and no other known and actionable oncogenic driver alterations, and who are relapsed/refractory to prior EGFR-, HER2-, or HER3-directed therapy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cohort 3 (Exploratory): Up to ten patients who have (i) tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion without an intact EGF-like domain, (ii) tumors with other NRG1 alterations, (iii) tumors with additional known alterations without standard treatment options, or (iv) insufficient tissue biopsies available for central confirmation of NRG1 fusion status.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary endpoint of the CRESTONE trial is to determine the ORR by independent radiologic review according to RECIST 1.1. Tumor assessments will be measured and recorded by the local radiologist beginning at week 6. Independent central review of scans will be conducted for patients enrolled in Cohort 1.
Key secondary endpoints include DOR, PFS, OS, Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR; CR, PR, SD > 24 weeks), and the safety profile of seribantumab in patients with a tumor harboring an NRG1 fusion. Patients are expected to be treated until investigator-assessed progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.
After all screening procedures and determination of eligibility for trial treatment (including a local NRG1 fusion positive testing result) have been completed, eligible patients will be assigned to the appropriate cohort based upon prior treatment history and local NRG1 fusion testing results. We expect to complete enrollment of the first 20 patients in Cohort 1 of the CRESTONE study in mid-2022, and to present initial clinical data from approximately 10 patients from Cohort 1 of the CRESTONE study treated with seribantumab at 3 grams weekly at a major medical meeting in mid-2022. We believe that the design and conduct of CRESTONE, subject to discussions with the FDA, may support submission of a BLA for accelerated approval in advanced solid tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion.
Key design components of CRESTONE
Several important design considerations have been built into the CRESTONE protocol that we believe may optimize for efficient conduct and a clean signal in the primary efficacy analysis population.

● | A tumor-agnostic trial design maximizes opportunity for patient eligibility in this rare, genomically defined population.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To avoid introduction of delays in patient screening leading to delayed initiation of treatment in this aggressive disease, patient eligibility is based on readily accessible, local CLIA-certified testing including PCR, FISH, DNA- or RNA-based NGS testing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To control for variability introduced by screening through local CLIA-certified testing, all patients in Cohort 1 will also have a central confirmatory test by RNA-based NGS to confirm the presence of an NRG1 fusion to help rule out any false-positive test results that may come from their prior local CLIA-certified testing. Only
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16




patients with a centrally confirmed NRG1 fusion are included in the primary efficacy analysis population for statistical analysis.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Due to the currently limited understanding of clinical impact of prior exposure to anti-ERBB therapy, patients that have received prior anti-ERBB therapy are excluded from Cohort 1. These patients may be enrolled into Cohort 2.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The current literature suggests that an NRG1 fusion must retain a functional EGF-like binding domain to enable ligand-dependent HER3 signaling. Therefore, patients with an NRG1 fusion that lacks an EGF-like domain are excluded from Cohort 1. These patients may instead be enrolled in Cohort 3.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients with co-expression of other known oncogenic drivers are excluded from Cohort 1. We believe that seribantumab as a monotherapy has the greatest potential for positive clinical outcomes in tumors uniquely driven by an NRG1 fusion. Patients with co-expression of other known oncogenic drivers, where there is no suitable alternative therapy to target these oncogenic drivers, may instead be enrolled in Cohort 3.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Because NRG1 fusions are often found in more aggressive tumor types, it is important to achieve steady state of seribantumab as quickly as possible for disease control. The design of CRESTONE includes a proactive safety run-in and dose optimization phase to ensure that all subsequent patients comprising the primary efficacy analysis population are receiving an optimal dose specific to the NRG1 fusion population.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patient identification and clinical conduct in CRESTONE
We proactively addressed key challenges in identifying and enrolling patients into trials for rare genomically defined tumors. We are employing multiple innovative models designed to ensure Good Clinical Practice and enhance enrollment of our Phase 2 CRESTONE trial through real-time nationwide identification of patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion from our academic core sites and within our partner networks, in a capital-efficient manner. Through these mechanisms, we are rapidly alerted when any patient with an NRG1 fusion is identified across major diagnostic networks and have access to approximately 400 potential clinical trial sites in total.
Currently, patients may be enrolled onto CRESTONE via three mechanisms:

● | Enrollment at core sites: These clinical trial sites are located at major academic and community medical centers and are strategically selected due to their deep clinical trial experience and an existing ability to locally test for NRG1 fusions. These sites are activated on a permanent basis for the duration of the trial.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Referral to core sites from diagnostic partner networks: We have partnered with diagnostic providers such as Ashion Analytics (now Exact Sciences), NeoGenomics, and Strata Oncology and anticipate the potential to engage in additional partnerships in the future. These partnerships allow us access to diagnostic data generated using comprehensive DNA- and RNA-based NGS assays for the presence of an NRG1 fusion. When a patient with a tumor that has an NRG1 fusion is identified in their networks, we are alerted and put in touch with the treating physician to determine if the patient is eligible for CRESTONE with the treating physician being notified of the most proximal CRESTONE site.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “On-demand” site initiation: Our partnerships with diagnostic providers such as Caris Life Sciences and Tempus, and health networks like The US Oncology Network (through their Selected Trials for Accelerate Rollout program), give us access to pre-qualified sites that can be quickly activated in approximately 14 days or fewer following the identification of a patient with a tumor harboring an NRG1 fusion that meets trial entry criteria and qualifies for CRESTONE. These sites are in addition to the core sites participating in CRESTONE.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that recent advances in genomic testing, and subsequent increased adoption of RNA-based NGS, will result in improved identification of patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion. In addition to academic and community-based medical centers that are routinely conducting testing, there are multiple commercial diagnostic companies that 

17



include NRG1 fusions on their CLIA-certified testing panels. Some examples of these companies are: Ashion Analytics (now Exact Sciences), Caris, Illumina, Invitae (ArcherDx), NeoGenomics, Strata Oncology, Tempus and ThermoFisher, among others. In addition, Foundation Medicine can detect gene fusions potentially indicative of an NRG1 fusion through the identification of common NRG1 fusion partners, such as CD74. We anticipate partnering with a diagnostic provider to develop a companion diagnostic for seribantumab use in patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion. This may be done in parallel to the CRESTONE trial or as a post-marketing commitment following a potential accelerated approval contingent upon continued discussion with the FDA.
We believe that the number of genomic tests that are conducted across tumor types, and the number of companies that include NRG1 fusions on their test panels, will continue to increase over time.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational product candidates, as well as our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates.
We are currently party to a manufacturing agreement with Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, for the manufacturing of seribantumab drug substance and the performance of associated quality related services. Options for redundant or replacement supply are under active evaluation. Seribantumab is currently being manufactured at a scale appropriate for clinical trials and has previously been manufactured at a scale suitable for commercialization. To the extent we approach commercialization for seribantumab or any other product candidates, we expect that we would identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the drug substance and fill finish services as a part of such commercialization plans.
We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacturing of any companion diagnostics we may develop.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, the expertise of our team, and our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face increasing competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
We compete directly with companies that focus on oncology and companies dedicating their resources to cancer therapies. With the proliferation of new drugs and therapies into oncology, we expect to face increasingly intense competition as new technologies become available and new therapeutic candidates are clinically developed or approved therapies are explored for new indications. Any candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly 

18



through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic antibody candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, and are more convenient or less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or could otherwise make our development more complicated. We believe the key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety and patient convenience. Even if our antibody candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by then.
There are a number of biological and biotechnology companies that currently are pursuing the development of precision oncology therapies for patients with undrugged, genetically-defined cancers with high unmet need. In particular, we expect that our current lead product candidate, seribantumab, will compete against other ERBB or HER3 inhibitors that are in development for targeting tumors with an NRG1 fusion, including those of Merus N.V. (zenocutuzumab — MCLA-128), Hummingbird Bioscience Ltd. (HMBD-001 — 10D1F), GamaMabs Pharma (9F7-F11), and AVEO Oncology (AV-203). We may face further competition from companies pursuing the development of product candidates that are ERBB or HER3 inhibitors not currently in defined clinical plans for targeting tumors with an NRG1 fusion, including ISU ABXIS, Daiichi Sankyo, Celldex, GlaxoSmithKline, Boehringer Ingelheim, or others. Development efforts and clinical results of these other future product candidates may be unsuccessful, which could result in a negative perception of HER3 inhibitors, for instance, and negatively impact the regulatory approval process of our lead product candidate, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business.
Asset purchase, licensing and collaboration agreements
Previous sponsor
In May 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with the previous sponsor, pursuant to which we acquired the previous sponsor’s anti-HER3 antibody programs, or the Acquired Product Candidates, including seribantumab. Upon closing of the asset purchase agreement in July 2019, we paid the previous sponsor an upfront cash payment of $3.5 million. In addition to the foregoing payment, we may become obligated to pay the previous sponsor up to $54.5 million in additional potential development, regulatory approval and commercial-based milestone payments, consisting of:

● | $3.0 million for achievement of the primary endpoint in the first registrational clinical trial of any Acquired Product Candidate;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | up to $16.5 million in total payments for the achievement of various regulatory approval and reimbursement-based milestones in the United States, Europe and Japan; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | up to $35.0 million in total payments for achieving various cumulative worldwide net sales targets between $100.0 million and $300.0 million for the Acquired Product Candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dyax
Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement with the previous sponsor, and in connection with the closing of the asset purchase agreement, we (i) assumed all of the previous sponsor’s obligations and rights under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, or the Dyax collaboration agreement, between the previous sponsor and Dyax Corp., or Dyax, 

19



which was entered into in January 2007, including an exclusive, worldwide product license to clinically develop or commercialize seribantumab and (ii) agreed to be bound to the terms of a sublicense agreement between the previous sponsor and Dyax entered into in June 2008. Under the Dyax collaboration agreement, Dyax used its proprietary phage display technology to identify antibodies that bind to targets of interest to us as therapeutics or diagnostics. Seribantumab was identified through the Dyax collaboration agreement. In January 2016, Dyax was acquired by Shire plc, which was subsequently acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited in January 2019.
We may be required to make additional maximum aggregate development and regulatory milestone payments of up to approximately $9.3 million for seribantumab. In addition, Dyax is entitled to tiered mid single digit royalties based on net sales of seribantumab. Our obligation to pay royalties to Dyax continues on a country-by-country basis until the later of a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of seribantumab in such country and the expiration of the patent rights covering the product in such country. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the antibodies for which we obtain a commercial license.
This agreement will remain in effect, unless terminated earlier, for so long as we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees continue to develop or commercialize products that remain royalty-bearing under the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. We also may terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice.
Ligand Pharmaceuticals
Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement with the previous sponsor, and in connection with the closing of the asset purchase agreement, we purchased from the previous sponsor all of the right, title and interest in and to the commercial license agreement between the previous sponsor and Selexis SA, or Selexis, for non-exclusive rights to technology for use in the manufacture of certain biologic products. Under this agreement, we are required to make aggregate milestone payments of up to €0.9 million, per licensed product, and pay royalties of less than one percent on net sales of product, which royalty payments expire in 2026. The obligation to pay royalties with respect to each product sold in a country continues until the expiration of the patent rights covering the product in such country. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. We also have the right to terminate the agreement at any time upon 60 days’ prior written notice. In November of 2021, the Selexis agreement was assigned to Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.
Caris Agreement
In June 2021, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Caris, or the Caris Agreement. Under the terms of the Caris Agreement, Caris will identify targets for the collaboration and provide those targets to Elevation at regular intervals for review and approval. Once a target is selected by the collaboration’s joint steering committee, the collaboration will retain access to the selected targets.
The financial terms surrounding development and commercialization of each product candidate identified for the collaboration and included in the Caris Agreement vary based on the level of participation elected by each party in the development and commercialization efforts following identification of a target. There are no upfront or milestone payments or royalties due to either party under the collaboration. With respect to proceeds from any potential commercial transaction related to a product resulting from the collaboration, Caris will be entitled to a tiered initial percentage ranging from the mid-single digits to low teens based on the product candidate’s potential peak sales revenue with the remaining proceeds allocated based on each party’s pro rata share of expenses incurred in development of the product. In the case of an out-licensing transaction of an asset instead of a sale, Caris and we will split all consideration received in the transaction in a similar manner. The Caris Agreement provides flexibility for Caris and us to jointly develop and commercialize, or for either us or Caris to incur development and commercialization expenses. The ultimate percentage of proceeds payable to us and Caris will depend on the level of development and commercialization participation elected by each party.
We will own the intellectual property rights to the therapeutics developed under the collaboration, and Caris will own the intellectual property rights to the diagnostics developed under the collaboration.

20



Either party may terminate the Caris Agreement for uncured material breach by the other party or in the case of the other party’s insolvency. The term of the Caris Agreement is three years, automatically renewing for one-year terms. Either party may terminate the agreement at the end of a term by written notice to the other, subject to the continuation of exclusivity with respect to any target selected by the joint steering committee, so long as commercially reasonable efforts are used to discover, identify, develop and/or commercialize a therapeutic related to such target.
Intellectual property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the compositions of matter of our product candidate, its methods of use, and other inventions that are important to our business.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions, and know-how related to our business, to defend and enforce our patents, to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of precision oncology.
Our wholly owned patent portfolio includes a patent family with claims directed to antibodies and related compositions covering seribantumab, as well as methods of treating cancer using such antibodies and compositions. The family contains three U.S. patents directed to seribantumab which expire in February 2028 and a fourth U.S. patent which expires in October 2029 (including 614 days of Patent Term Adjustment), subject to any disclaimers or extensions. The family also contains a pending U.S. application, which if issued, would expire in February 2028, subject to any disclaimers or extensions.
In addition, the above-discussed patent family includes granted patents in China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, and Japan with claims directed to compositions of matter covering seribantumab and related methods of therapy. These patents expire in February 2028, subject to any disclaimers or extensions.
Our patent portfolio further includes an additional early-stage, unpublished patent family specifically covering the use of seribantumab to treat patients harboring an NRG1 fusion according to our CRESTONE clinical trial dosing regimen. Any patents issuing from this family would expire in March 2042, subject to any disclaimers or extensions.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. The term of a patent in the United States can be adjusted due to any failure of the United States Patent and Trademark Office following certain statutory and regulation deadlines for issuing a patent.
In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for a portion of the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the original expiration of the patent. The protection provided by a patent varies from country to country, and is dependent on the type of patent granted, the scope of the patent claims, and the legal remedies available in a given country. Additionally, we expect seribantumab to be subject to biological exclusivity in the United States for twelve years from BLA approval under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. See “Government Regulation and Product Approval — Biosimilars.”
It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and 

21



development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property.
Governmental Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, biological products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, with the exception that the section of the FDC Act that governs the approval of drugs via new drug applications, or NDAs, does not apply to the approval of biologics. In contrast, biologics are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Biological product development for a new product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including Good Laboratory Practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity in animals, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA regulations or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. Imposition of a clinical hold may be full or partial. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or 

22



IRB, for approval. The IRB will also monitor the clinical trial until completed. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial.
Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug or biologic into patients, the product is tested to assess safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with drug exposure, and to obtain early evidence of a treatment effect if possible. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the biologic for a particular indication, determine optimal dose and regimen, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical effects and confirm efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the biologic. In rare instances, a single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient when either (1) the trial is a large, multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) the single trial is supported by other confirmatory evidence. Approval on the basis of a single trial may be subject to a requirement for additional post-approval studies.
These phases may overlap or be combined. For example, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial may contain both a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage, the latter of which may confirm tolerability at the recommended dose for expansion in future clinical trials (as in traditional Phase 1 clinical trials) and provide insight into the anti-tumor effects of the investigational therapy in selected subpopulation(s). Typically, during the development of oncology therapies, all subjects enrolled in Phase 1 clinical trials are disease-affected patients and, as a result, considerably more information on clinical activity may be collected during such trials than during Phase 1 clinical trials for non-oncology therapies.
In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational biologic in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug or biologic.
After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing and distribution of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. Under an approved BLA, the applicant is also subject to an annual program fee. These fees typically increase annually. A BLA for a drug that has been designated as an orphan drug is not subject to an application fee, unless the BLA includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the FDA’s determination that it is adequately organized and sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the review of BLAs. Most applications are classified as Standard Review products that are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the BLA; applications classified as Priority Review are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the BLA. A BLA can be classified for Priority Review when the FDA determines the biologic has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority reviews may be extended by the FDA for three or more additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the BLA submission.

The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, as well as biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to be reviewed by an advisory committee — typically a panel that includes clinicians, statisticians and other experts — for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the BLA should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective, or the biologic is safe, pure, potent, and effective, in the respective claimed indication.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and completes any clinical and manufacturing site inspections, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the BLA submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application for approval. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing and distribution of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure a product’s safe use, or ETASU. An ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient-specific registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved BLA, including changes in indications, product labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA, or supplement to an approved BLA, before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing original BLAs.
Fast Track Designation and Priority Review
FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs or biologic products that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Any product submitted to FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review.
Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of applications for approval of products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that FDA designate the product 

24



candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the product candidate. FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical studies in an efficient manner.
Accelerated Approval
Accelerated approval may be granted for a product that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that generally provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large studies to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence and, in most cases, the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated, and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may grant orphan drug designation to products intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a rare disease for which it has such designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Other benefits of orphan drug designation include tax credits for certain research and an exemption from the BLA application fee.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologic products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of a clinical trial are then made 

25



public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of clinical development programs as well as clinical trial design.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, BLAs, or supplements to BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product with orphan product designation except a product with a new active ingredient that is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides a six-month extension of any non-patent exclusivity for a biologic if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the lot manufacturing history and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before allowing the manufacturer to release the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of a BLA, biologics manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety summary reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must 

26



continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologics manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects a biologic product’s manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with required regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Biosimilars
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical trials, animal trials, and a clinical trial or trials, unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services waives a required element. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a previously approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. To date, a number of biosimilar products and two interchangeable products have been approved under the BPCIA. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose some hurdles to biosimilar product implementation, which is still being evaluated by the FDA.
A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure, or BLA approval, of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the biosimilar abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
If safe and effective use of a product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, before or at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a new therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication.
Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our products will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by CDER and the FDA’s Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health. We anticipate partnering with a diagnostic provider to develop a companion diagnostic for seribantumab use in patients with tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion. Review and approval of a companion diagnostic is typically done in parallel with development of the therapeutic product.  However, it is possible that FDA may permit approval of the companion diagnostic for seribantumab as a post-marketing commitment following a potential regulatory approval.

27



Under the FDC Act, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDC Act and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. The vast majority of companion diagnostics require PMA approval.
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, additional testing and/or restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained, or problems are identified following initial marketing.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also register their establishments and list their devices with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and the processes of the specification developer and repackager/relabeler (if different from the manufacturer) and initial importer (if manufactured outside of the United States), are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. 
Other Healthcare Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, transparency and health information privacy laws and other healthcare laws and regulations.

28



The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, amended the intent element of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates and their subcontractors that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA.
Further, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a final rule that requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and annually report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) physician assistants, certain types of advance practice nurses, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by 

29



physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
Analogous state and foreign anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor. In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Further, certain states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain drug pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Additionally, we may also be subject to state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable state, federal, and foreign healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. On September 9, 2021, the Biden administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, plan includes, among other reform measures, proposals to lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and disincentivizing price increases, and to support market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase price transparency. Many similar proposals, including the plans to give Medicare Part D authority to negotiate drug prices, require drug manufacturers to pay rebates on drugs whose prices increase greater than the rate of inflation, and cap out-of-pocket costs, have already been included in policy statements and legislation currently being considered by Congress. It is unclear to what extent these and other statutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented. 
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

30



Coverage and Reimbursement
Patients in the United States and elsewhere generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Accordingly, market acceptance of our drug products is dependent on the extent to which third-party coverage and reimbursement is available from government health administration authorities (including in connection with government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States), private healthcare insurers and other healthcare funding organizations. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Coverage decisions may not favor new drug products when more established or lower-cost therapeutic alternatives are already available. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of our drug products.
Coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement as the process of determining coverage and reimbursement is often time-consuming and costly which will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be obtained. It is difficult to predict at this time what government authorities and third-party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for our drug products. Additionally, we may develop, either by ourselves or with collaborators, companion diagnostic tests for our product candidates for certain indications. We, or our collaborators, if any, will be required to obtain coverage and reimbursement for these tests separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement we seek for our product candidates, once approved.
The market for our product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures. In particular, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular reference listed drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a reference listed drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governmental entities have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our drugs products from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
In addition, we expect that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third-party payors and government authorities to continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more drug products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Employees and human capital resources
As of February 28, 2022, we had 35 full-time employees. Of these employees, five held Ph.D. or Pharm.D degrees, and 26 were engaged in research, development and technical operations. From time to time, we also retain independent contractors and consultants to support our organization. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purpose of our incentive share plan is to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of incentive share-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.

31



Facilities
We are a remote-first company, meaning that substantially all of our employees work remotely. As a result of this strategy, we do not maintain a corporate headquarters or lease any corporate facilities. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future, and that, should we need additional physical office space, suitable additional space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
Legal proceedings
From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm, and other factors.
