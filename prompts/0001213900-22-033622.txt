Item 1. Business.



MICT, Inc. (“MICT”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) was formed as a Delaware corporation on January 31, 2002 under the name Lapis Technologies, Inc. On March 14, 2013, we changed our corporate name to Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc. On July 13, 2018, following the sale of our former subsidiary, Enertec Systems Ltd., we changed our name to MICT, Inc. Our shares have been listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “MICT” since April 29, 2013.



MICT is a holding company conducting financial technology business through its subsidiaries and entities controlled through various VIE arrangements (“VIE entities”). The company is principally focused on developing insurance broker business and products across approximately 120 cities in China through its subsidiaries and VIE entities, with planned expansion into additional markets. The company has developed highly scalable proprietary platforms for insurance products (B2B, B2B2C and B2C) and financial services/products (B2C), the technology for which is highly adaptable for other applications and markets. MICT through its subsidiaries has also acquired and holds the requisite license and approvals with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission to deal in securities and provide securities advisory and asset management services. MICT also has memberships/registrations with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the requisite Hong Kong and China Direct clearing companies. MICT’s financial services business and first financial services product, the Magpie Invest app, is able to trade securities on NASDAQ, NYSE, TMX, HKSE, China Stock Connect, LSE, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the Paris Stock Exchange.



Since July 1, 2020, after MICT completed its acquisition of GFHI (the “GFHI Acquisition”) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on November 7, 2019 by and between MICT, GFHI, Global Fintech Holding Ltd. (“GFH”), a British Virgin Islands company and the sole shareholder of GFH Intermediate Holdings Ltd. (“GFHI” or “Intermediate”), and MICT Merger Subsidiary Inc., a British Virgin Islands company and a wholly owned subsidiary of MICT (“Merger Sub”), as amended and restated on April 15, 2020 (the “Restated Merger Agreement” or “Merger”), we have been operating in the financial technology sector. GFHI is a financial technology company with a marketplace in China, as well as other areas of the world and is currently in the process of building various platforms for business opportunities in different verticals and technology segments in order to capitalize on such technology and business. GFHI plans to increase its capabilities and its technological platforms through acquisition and licensing technologies to support its growth efforts in the different market segments. After the Merger, MICT included the business of Intermediate, MICT’s wholly-owned subsidiary, operating through Intermediate operating subsidiaries.



Following Intermediate’s acquisition of Magpie Securities Limited (“Magpie”), a Hong Kong securities and investment services firm, on February 26, 2021 and the subsequent receipt of regulatory approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, Magpie is licensed to deal in securities, futures and options, and also undertake the business of securities advisory services and asset management.


Intermediate launched Magpie Invest, a global stock trading app, on September 15, 2021, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Magpie Securities Limited (“Magpie”). It is a proprietary technology investment trading platform that is currently operational in Hong Kong. Magpie Invest’s technology allows the platform to connect to all major stock exchanges and we planned to expand into Australia and Switzerland by Q4 2022.




These opportunities will continue to be realized and executed through our business development efforts, which include the acquisition of potential target entities, business and assets (such as applicable required licenses) in the relevant business space and segments in which we plan to operate. We believe that this will allow the Company to enter into the market quickly and leverage existing assets in order to promote our growth strategy.



Prior to July 1, 2020, MICT operated primarily through its Israel-based then majority-owned subsidiary, Micronet. Micronet, through both its Israeli and U.S. operational offices, designs, develops, manufactures and sells rugged mobile computing devices that provide fleet operators and field workforces with computing solutions in challenging work environments.

Potential Merger with Tingo, Inc.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), Merger Sub will merge with and into Tingo (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”), with the Seller continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of MICT. It is expected that current holders of Tingo Shares will own approximately 77% of the total shares of the post-merger company and the current shareholders of MICT will own the remaining 23% of the Shares of the post-merger company.



Tingo is the leading Agri fintech company operating in Africa, with a marketplace platform that empowers social upliftment through mobile, technology and financial access for rural farming communities. Their ‘device as a service’ model allows them to add market leading applications to enable customers to trade, buy top ups, pay bills, access insurance and lending services. With 9.3 million existing customers, Tingo is seeking to expand its operations across select markets in Africa. Tingo’s strategic plan is to become the eminent Pan African Agri-Fintech business delivering social upliftment and financial inclusion to millions of SME farmers and women-led businesses. There can be no assurances given that the Company will consummate this merger since there are several conditions before the merger could be consummated including, but not limited to, the approval by the shareholders of the Company and Tingo, Regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

Market Opportunity



China’s insurance brokerage market has experienced rapid growth due to increased demand for insurance products in the past few years. According to iResearch report, the total insurance premium in China is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.9% from 2019 to 2024.  China is the second biggest insurance market in the world. 497 insurance broker companies, which sell insurance policies underwritten by insurance companies and design and develop insurance products themselves according to customer needs, and 1764 insurance agent companies, which are only licensed to only sell insurance policies underwritten by insurance, sold insurance products with an aggregate premium amount of 3.98 trillion RMB (approximately $0.62 trillion) in the year of 2020.



Although the size of China’s insurance market in terms of insurance premium was the second largest in the world according to the iResearch report, insurance penetration (defined as insurance premium over GDP) and insurance density (defined as insurance premium per capita) in China were still substantially lower than those in developed countries, indicating significant growth potentials. According to the 14th Five Year Plan formulated by the Chinese government, China’s insurance penetration and density are expected to reach 6.8% and RMB6,596 (approximately US$971), respectively, by 2025.



Driven by the significant medical protection gap and rising awareness for protection, the Chinese insurance market is expected to reach RMB7.8 trillion by 2024, representing a CAGR of 12.9% from 2019. Thanks to regulatory tailwinds, growth in household disposable income and increasing awareness for health protection, Chinese insurance market is expected to continue to maintain the strong growth momentum in the long term.











As set forth in the table below, the total insurance market in China in 2019 was RMB 4.3 trillion (approximately $0.68 trillion), according to a report by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, which represents a 10% growth in market size from 2018.




 | Property Insurance (Unit: RMB 100 Billion) | | Life Insurance (Unit: RMB 100 Billion) | | Health Insurance (Unit: RMB 100 Billion) | Accident Insurance (Unit: RMB 100 Billion) | Total (Unit: RMB 100 Billion) 
-----+---------------------------------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------+-------+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+--------------------------------
2018 | | 10.77 | | 20.72 | | 5.45 | | 1.08 | 38.02
2019 | | 11.65 | | 22.75 | | 7.07 | | 1.18 | 42.65




Local insurance companies in China only offer a limited range of insurance products, which cannot meet the needs of a 1.4 billion Chinese population, as compared to the product offerings by U.S. or European insurers in those countries with a smaller population.



Through its regulatory actions, the Chinese government encourages participation of foreign investors in insurance companies and related businesses. Under the PRC law, foreign investors are permitted to have up to 100% ownership in insurance companies. Furthermore, foreign joint venture companies may transact insurance business online and offline.

Stock Trading and Wealth Management Platform: Magpie Invest 



The Company launched Magpie Invest, a global stock trading app, on September 15, 2021, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Magpie Securities Limited (“Magpie”).



Magpie Invest is a proprietary technology investment trading platform that is currently operational in Hong Kong. Magpie Invest’s technology allows the platform to connect to all major stock exchanges and we plan to expand into Australia and Switzerland by Q4 2022.



Following Intermediate’s acquisition of Huapei Global Securities, Ltd. (“Huapei”), a Hong Kong securities and investment services firm, on February 26, 2021 and the subsequent receipt of regulatory approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, Magpie is licensed to deal in securities, futures and options, and also undertake the business of securities advisory services and asset management.



Magpie is a member of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Clearing Company, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange China Connect and the London Stock Exchange.



In the future, Magpie intends to launch new and differentiated marketing campaigns which we believe may attract higher value customers. Magpie has offices in Hong Kong and Singapore and currently employs more than 50 full-time employees and 60 contract staff. Magpie aims to expand into additional jurisdictions and geographical markets, both within Asia and other regions of the world.
The Platform for Securities Trading



We believe we offer a unique user experience built upon a scalable and secure platform. The platform is designed to serve the emerging affluent Chinese population and diaspora, and targets generation Z and the millennial population. We are pursuing an opportunity to facilitate a shift in the wealth management industry and build a digital gateway into broader financial services. The platform is designed to provide a user experience that integrates clear and relevant market and company data, and easy to use trade execution. We aim to continue to enhance this technology and build a comprehensive, user-oriented and cloud-based platform that is fully licensed to conduct securities brokerage business on a global basis as we expand our license portfolio. The stock trading platform will serve as a one of the foundations from which we can execute our growth strategy of building a broader financial services platform.



We provide investing services through a proprietary digital platform, which is accessible through any mobile device on IOS and Android. We plan to launch a web-based platform in late Q2 of 2022 to offer an alternative to the mobile application. We intend for this platform to also complement our mobile application. Our application currently offers market data, news, research, analytical tools and provides customers with a data foundation to help simplify the investing decision-making process.



Market Opportunity



According to an iResearch Report, published on January 15, 2020, the market size of the online brokerage industry focusing on global Chinese investors in terms of U.S. and Hong Kong stock trading volume experienced rapid growth over the past three years. This presents an attractive market opportunity for online brokerage service providers focused on the global Chinese investor market. We believe that the technology, functionality and user experience of our platform also creates the opportunity for us to target a larger investor market (not only the Chinese investor market) in the major territories throughout the world.



Revenues are currently generated primarily from stock trading commission income. Magpie is also generating income from other revenue streams such as interest from financing and foreign exchange. We plan to add derivatives and charges from investment management introductions and consulting to the platform in Q3 2022.



With popularization of mobile technology and growing acceptance of online trading, we believe that the online securities market is characterized by the following trends:




● | traditional brokers are shifting online while purely offline brokers are increasingly at a disadvantage or, in some cases, exiting the market altogether;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Internet giants continue to invest in online brokerage services, demonstrating the industry’s recognition of online brokerage services as an important component of a financial services business and potentially a gateway to broader opportunities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | technological barriers to entry remain high particularly relating to building a secure infrastructure that can transcend geographies and asset classes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operational barriers to entry remain high particularly relating to regulatory and capital requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | user experience remains a key competitive strength as digitally born investors become a larger component of the addressable market; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | revenue models are evolving as competition intensifies, with ancillary and other value-added services underlying platform differentiation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenges



Our ability to execute this business plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those relating to our ability to:




● | manage the continued rollout of our trading platforms and our future growth; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment; 
● | offer personalized and competitive services; 
● | increase the utilization of our services by users and clients; 
● | maintain and enhance our relationships with our business partners; 
● | enhance our technology infrastructure to support the growth of our business and maintain the security of our systems and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized across our systems; 
● | improve our operational efficiency; 
● | attract, retain and motivate talented employees to support our business growth; 


● | navigate economic condition and fluctuation; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | defend ourselves against legal and regulatory actions, such as actions involving intellectual property or privacy claims; and 
● | obtain any and all licenses necessary for the operation and growth of our business. 

Strategy



We intend to provide a high-quality and comprehensive investing experience by focusing on delivering convenience and stability to our customers.



We have designed every step of our platform’s experience, from sourcing and researching ideas to trade execution and subsequent portfolio management, with a goal to create a simple and convenient experience. We identify certain hurdles that investors, particularly retail investors, face along their investing journey, and we strive to mitigate inconvenience and information asymmetry through our platform with the use of data and technology.



We recognize that investing is a meaningful component of our customers’ broader wealth management. With this in mind, our platform features the following:




● | our platform features an automated multi-level protection mechanism to ensure the services and functions we deliver to our users and clients are secure; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | we have adopted strict security policies and measures, including encryption technology and a two-factor authentication function, to protect our proprietary data such as customers’ personal information and trading data; 
● | our cloud technology allows us to process large amounts of data in-house, which should reduce the risks involved in data storage and transmission; 


● | we back up our data at different servers spread across different locations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | we process and execute all of our orders and transactions electronically, which is designed to minimize the risks associated with human error while maintaining the stability of our platform. 




We provide customers with a comprehensive set of services throughout their investing experience. Our core services include trade execution and margin financing. The trade execution process is entirely online and automated. Orders are delivered directly to respective exchanges.



As a result of the operational efficiencies afforded by our technology, we can offer very competitive brokerage commission rates for online trading as compared to many of our more traditional competitors. Our revenues from securities brokerage services includes brokerage commissions and platform service fees from our customers, which are recognized on a trade-date basis when the relevant transactions are executed.



Margin Financing



We offer margin financing to customers who trade securities listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the major stock exchanges in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Europe. This feature essentially allows customers to borrow against their own stock and cash holdings in order to buy additional securities on margin. All financing extended to our customers is secured by stocks we feel have enough liquidity and low volatility. They are automatically pledged in cross-market account assets so that the value in a customers’ multiple market trading account, which may include cash in different currencies and acceptable securities listed on the three markets, will be aggregated when calculating the value of the customers’ collateral. In particular, we believe this will provide efficiencies as it will eliminate the costs and procedures involved in cross-market currency translation or exchange.



Our customers are eligible for margin financing services when they hold securities that are acceptable as pledges to us in their accounts. We maintain a list of acceptable marginable securities on our website www.MICT-inc.com. The credit line for each eligible customer is determined based on the securities across all of his or her trading accounts. The margin financing services for eligible margin financing customers are activated automatically, when the funds in their accounts are not sufficient to purchase the desired securities and there is still sufficient balance in their credit lines.



We have a list of securities acceptable as collateral to us and their respective margin ratios that is regularly updated and shared with our customers. Our risk management team’s role is to determine the margin ratio for each of the acceptable securities based on the trading frequency, historical price fluctuations and general market volatility. We will also reference the financing terms of major financial institutions in establishing our margin ratios and intend for our margin requirements to be equal or lower than the financial institutions. We believe this will differentiate our risk controls. Our margin ratios are monitored in real-time and our risk management team review and adjust the margin ratios for each acceptable security on a quarterly basis and more frequently in the case of a significant and rapid price decline.



Users and Clients



Our current customer is investors living in Hong Kong and in 14 other countries that allowed trading under the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) rules. We are growing our customer base mainly through online and offline marketing and promotional activities. Those activities include external marketing channels that we cooperate with and directly pay for as well as promotional and marketing campaigns conducted on the platform, word-of-mouth referrals, and our corporate services.
Risk Management



We have established a comprehensive and robust technology-driven risk management system to manage risks across our business and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations. We have established a risk management committee which has formulated key risk management policies and procedures and a risk management team having relevant experience to execute these policies and procedures. This committee meets on a weekly basis.
Data Security and Protection



We have established a comprehensive security system, to be supported by our network situational awareness and risk management system. The security system is designed with the capability to handle malicious attacks to safeguard the security of the platform and to protect the privacy of its users and clients.



We have established a data security team of engineers and technicians dedicated to protecting the security of our data. We also have a data protection policy and internal protocols to ensure the security of our proprietary data. On the customer side, we have a dual identification verification function to protect our customer’s account security.



Competition



The market for online stock trading and investment services is rapidly evolving. There are many competitors that are already operating of various sizes offering access to overseas markets and wealth management products.
Licenses



We are currently not onboarding customers located in mainland China due to the People’s Bank of China (“PBOC”) and the China Securities Regulatory Commissions (“CSRC”) new guidance regarding the onboarding of residents via Hong Kong through licensed entities under the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) guidelines.



Under PRC securities laws and regulations, entities operating securities brokerage business in the PRC are now required to obtain a securities brokerage license to onboard mainland residents even if they have overseas bank accounts.




Magpie Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd has been set up and submitted its MAS license application in late December. the first round of questions has been received and answered, we are expecting the approval in late May 2022.



The Company’s platforms in China, provided through its operating subsidiaries, will be subject to the following laws and regulations that are specific to the industries in which it plans to conduct businesses, in addition to the PRC laws and regulations that are generally applicable to the contemplated businesses in China.













Impact of COVID-19 and Our Resources and Opportunities



The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic disrupted business operations of many companies in Hong Kong, China and elsewhere. We have taken a series of measures in response to the outbreak to protect our staff, including, among others, combined office and remote working arrangements for our employees and travel restrictions or suspension. Our operations, including our services to our clients and internal control over financial reporting, have not been materially affected by these measures as we timely implemented our business continuity plan without any meaningful resource constraints.



Further, in view of the increased market volatility witnessed in the global capital markets and increased COVID-19 restrictions in Hong Kong, although people are spending more time at home, it has not led to an increased in new account sign-ups, or increasing trading velocity and higher net asset inflow.



This has increased competition and raised the cost of acquisition of customers and also lengthened the cost recovery period which we believe is not currently economical.

The applicable laws and regulations governing insurance activities undertaken within the territories of the PRC consist principally of the PRC Insurance Law and rules and regulations promulgated under that law.

Historically, PRC laws and regulations have restricted foreign investment in ownership of insurance intermediary companies. In recent years, some rules and regulations governing the insurance intermediary sector in China have begun to encourage foreign investment. For instance, On March 1, 2015, the MOFCOM and the NDRC jointly promulgated the Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries (Revision 2015), or the 2015 Guidance Catalog, pursuant to which insurance brokerage are removed from the list of industries subject to foreign investment restriction.

The Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services (2011 Revision), which was promulgated on September 25, 2000 and amended on January 8, 2011 by the State Council, requires that commercial Internet information services providers, which mean providers of information or services to Internet users with charge, shall obtain a VATS License with the business scope of Internet information services, namely the Internet Content Provider License or the ICP License, from competent government authorities before providing any commercial Internet content services within the PRC. However, according to the 2019 Negative List/ the 2020 Negative List, the value-added telecommunications services carried on in PRC falls in the restricted category, and foreign investors cannot hold over 50% of equity interests in entities providing such services.











The Guiding Opinions of the Ministry of Commerce on Online Transactions (Provisional), which was promulgated and implemented on March 6, 2007, aims to regulate online transactions, assist and encourage participants to carry out online transactions, alert and prevent transaction risks, and provide guiding requirements on the basic principles for online transactions, the entering into of contracts by participants of online transactions, and the use of electronic signatures, online payments and advertising.



The Administrative Measures for On-line Trading, which was promulgated on February 17, 2014 and implemented with effect from March 15, 2014, further specifies the relevant measures for protecting on-line consumers’ rights, especially with regard to after-sale service, privacy protection and standard contract management, diversifies the types of unjust competitions conducted by an operator through network or certain media, and clarifies the regulatory and administrative responsibilities of the industry and commerce administration bureaus at different levels.
