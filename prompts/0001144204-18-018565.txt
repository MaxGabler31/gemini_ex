  ITEM 1.   BUSINESS. 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, “G-III”, “us”, “we” and “our” refer to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries. References to fiscal years refer to the year ended or ending on January 31 of that year. For example, our fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 is referred to as “fiscal 2018.” 
 G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. is a Delaware corporation that was formed in 1989. We and our predecessors have conducted our business since 1974. 
 All share and per share data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect our two-for-one stock split effected on May 1, 2015. 
 Overview 
 G-III designs, manufactures and markets an extensive range of apparel, including outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women’s suits and women’s performance wear, as well as women’s handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. G-III has a substantial portfolio of over 40 licensed and proprietary brands, anchored by five global power brands: DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld. We are not only licensees, but also brand owners, and we distribute our products through multiple channels of distribution including brick and mortar and online channels. 
 Our own proprietary brands include DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, Eliza J, Jessica Howard, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc and Marc New York. We sell products under an extensive portfolio of well-known licensed brands, including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, Levi’s, Docker’s, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan and Guess?. In our team sports business, we have licenses with the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League and over 150 U.S. colleges and universities. We also sell products under private retail labels for retailers such as Costco, Christopher A. Banks, Express, Harley Davidson, JC Penney and Ross Stores. 
 Our products are sold through a cross section of leading retailers such as Macy’s, Hudson’s Bay Company, including their Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue divisions, Ross Stores, Dillard’s, Burlington Coat Factory, Nordstrom, JC Penney and TJX Companies. We also sell our products over the web through retail partners such as Macys.com and Nordstrom.com, each of which has a significant online business. We have also increased sales to pure play online retail partners such as Amazon and Fanatics. 
 We also distribute apparel and other products through our own retail stores. Substantially all of our DKNY, Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass stores are operated as outlet stores. As of January 31, 2018, we operated 165 Wilsons Leather stores, 139 G.H. Bass stores, 51 DKNY stores, 8 Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores and 4 Calvin Klein Performance stores, of which 359 were located in the continental U.S. and Puerto Rico and 8 are located internationally. Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and DKNY each operates its own online store. In addition, as of January 31, 2018, Vilebrequin products were distributed through 91 company-operated stores, as well as through 66 franchised locations and e-commerce stores in each of Europe and the United States. 
 Recent Transactions 
 We have acquired businesses that have broadened our product offerings, expanded our ability to serve different tiers of distribution and added a retail component to our business. Our acquisitions and joint ventures are part of our strategy to expand our product offerings and increase the portfolio of proprietary and licensed brands that we offer through different tiers of retail distribution. 
 Donna Karan/DKNY
 In December 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Donna Karan International Inc. (“DKI”) from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Inc. (“LVMH”) for a total purchase price of approximately $674 million after taking into account certain adjustments. DKI owns Donna Karan and DKNY, two of the world’s most iconic and recognizable power brands. The acquisition of DKI fits squarely into our strategy to diversify and expand our business and to increase our ownership of brands. We intend to focus on the expansion of the DKNY brand, while also re-establishing Donna Karan and

  other associated brands. We believe that we can also capitalize on significant, untapped global licensing potential in a number of men’s categories, as well as in home and jewelry. We plan to leverage our demonstrated ability to drive organic growth, identify and integrate acquisitions and develop talent throughout the organization to maximize the potential of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. 
 In March 2017, we entered into an agreement with Macy’s under which Macy’s serves, since February 2018, as the exclusive U.S. department store for sales of DKNY women’s apparel and accessories. Under the agreement, Macy’s has the exclusive rights to sell DKNY women’s apparel, including women’s sportswear, dresses, suit separates, women’s performance wear, denim, swimwear and outerwear, handbags and women’s shoes, as well as men’s swimwear and outerwear, and luggage in all Macy’s locations and on Macys.com. The agreement also plans for increased and enhanced DKNY shop-in-shops in many Macy’s stores. G-III and Macy’s are committed to making DKNY the premier fashion and lifestyle brand. 
 We sell DKNY products through department stores, specialty retailers and online retailers worldwide, as well as through company-operated retail stores, e-commerce sites and distribution agreements. We also maintain DKNY’s agreements with international license partners and distributors outside of the United States. Products outside the exclusive categories and products distributed by DKNY’s various licensees under other categories will continue to be sold to department stores, including Macy’s. In addition, we re-launched Donna Karan as an aspirational luxury brand that is priced above DKNY and targeted to fine department stores globally. 
 In August 2017, we entered into a joint venture with Amlon Capital B.V. (“Amlon”) to produce and market women’s and men’s apparel and accessories pursuant to a long-term license for DKNY and Donna Karan in the People’s Republic of China, including Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We own 49% of the joint venture, with Amlon owning the remaining 51%. The principals of Amlon were formerly executives of Tommy Hilfiger and were instrumental in the expansion of the Tommy Hilfiger brand in China. The joint venture will be funded with $25 million of equity to be used to strengthen the DKNY and Donna Karan brands and accelerate the growth of the business in the region. Of this amount, we are required to contribute an aggregate of $10 million to the joint venture by August 2018. Starting January 1, 2018, this joint venture is the exclusive seller of women’s and men’s apparel, handbags, luggage and certain accessories under the DKNY and Donna Karan brands in the territory. The joint venture commenced operations in the second half of fiscal 2018 and was operating 13 stores as of January 31, 2018. 
 Karl Lagerfeld Paris
 In June 2015, we acquired a 49% interest in a joint venture that holds the worldwide rights to the Karl Lagerfeld trademarks, including the Karl Lagerfeld Paris brand we currently use, for consumer products (with certain exceptions) and apparel in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We were also the first licensee of the joint venture, having been granted a license for women’s apparel, women’s handbags, women’s and men’s footwear and men’s apparel. We began shipping Karl Lagerfeld Paris sportswear, dresses, women’s outerwear and handbags in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, Karl Lagerfeld Paris women’s footwear in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and Karl Lagerfeld Paris women’s suits in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. 
 In February 2016, we acquired a 19% minority interest in the parent company of the group that holds the worldwide rights to the Karl Lagerfeld brand. This investment is intended to expand the partnership between us and the owners of the Karl Lagerfeld brand and extend their business development opportunities on a global scale. The business plan for this entity includes developing its wholesale business, expanding its outlet retail footprint and further developing out its online presence. 
 Licensed Products 
 The sale of licensed products is a key element of our strategy and we have continually expanded our offerings of licensed products over the past 20 years. 
 In September 2017, we renewed our license agreements with Levi’s and Dockers for an additional four-year term. We also recently extended through 2020 our license agreements with the National Basketball Association and with the Camuto Group for Vince Camuto dresses.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  In July 2016, we signed a three-year extension through March 2020 of our license agreement with the National Football League. This agreement includes men’s and women’s outerwear, Starter men’s and women’s outerwear, men’s and women’s lifestyle apparel, Hands High men’s and women’s lifestyle apparel, and Touch by Alyssa Milano women’s lifestyle apparel. 
 In February 2016, we expanded our relationship with Tommy Hilfiger through a license agreement for Tommy Hilfiger womenswear in the United States and Canada. This license for women’s sportswear, dresses, suit separates, performance and denim is in addition to our existing Tommy Hilfiger licenses for men’s and women’s outerwear and luggage. This Tommy Hilfiger womenswear license agreement has an initial term of five years and a renewal term of four years. Macy’s is the principal retailer of Tommy Hilfiger in the United States and women’s sportswear continues to be a Macy’s exclusive offering. We believe Tommy Hilfiger is a classic American lifestyle brand. We intend to leverage our market expertise to help build sales of Tommy Hilfiger women’s apparel. We sell Tommy Hilfiger dresses, women’s suit separates, women’s performance wear, jeans and luggage. Women’s performance wear and women’s suits began shipping during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. 
 We believe that consumers prefer to buy brands they know, and we have continually sought licenses that would increase the portfolio of name brands we can offer through different tiers of retail distribution, for a wide array of products at a variety of price points. We believe that brand owners will look to consolidate the number of licensees they engage to develop product and they will seek licensees with a successful track record of expanding brands into new categories. It is our objective to continue to expand our product offerings and we are continually discussing new licensing opportunities with brand owners. 
 Licensing of Proprietary Brands 
 As we have increased our portfolio of proprietary brands, we have licensed these brands in new categories. We began licensing Andrew Marc, Vilebrequin and G.H. Bass in selected categories after acquiring these brands in 2008, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Our licensing program has significantly increased as a result of owning the Donna Karan and DKNY brands. 
 We currently license the DKNY brand for a broad array of products including fragrance, watches, hosiery, intimates, eyewear, children’s clothing, home furnishings, sleepwear and men’s tailored clothing. We recently licensed DKNY and Donna Karan men’s and women’s apparel and accessories in China pursuant to a long-term license agreement with a joint venture of which we are a 49% owner. We also recently signed license agreements for the DKNY brand in North America for men’s sportswear, men’s dress shirts, ties, small leather goods, men’s belts, fashion jewelry and children’s apparel. In addition, we entered into a license agreement for the DKNY and Donna Karan brands in North America for women’s belts. We intend to focus on expanding licensing opportunities for the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. We believe that we can capitalize on significant, untapped global licensing potential for these brands in a number of categories. 
 We license G.H. Bass for the wholesale distribution of men’s and women’s footwear, men’s sportswear, men’s and boy’s tailored clothing, men’s socks, men’s accessories and women’s hosiery. 
 Vilebrequin has entered into licenses for watches and sunglasses. 
 We currently license the Andrew Marc brand for men’s tailored clothing and men’s footwear. 
 Segments 
 We report based on two segments: wholesale operations and retail operations. 
 The wholesale operations segment includes sales of products under brands licensed by us from third parties, as well as sales of products under our own brands and private label brands. Wholesale sales and revenues from license agreements related to the DKI, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc and Vilebrequin businesses are included in the wholesale operations segment. 
 The retail operations segment consists primarily of our Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and DKNY retail stores, substantially all of which are operated as outlet stores, as well as a limited number of Calvin Klein Performance and Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores. Sales through our owned websites are also included in the retail operations segment.

 Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that our broad portfolio of high-profile brands combined with our extensive distribution relationships position us for growth. We intend to capitalize on the following competitive strengths in order to expand our position as an all-season diversified apparel company: 
 Broad portfolio of recognized brands.   In an environment of rapidly changing consumer fashion trends, we benefit from a balanced mix of over 40 licensed and proprietary brands anchored by five global power brands: DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld Paris. We believe we are a licensee of choice for well-known brands, as demonstrated by our partnerships with such brands as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld Paris, Levi’s, Dockers, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan and Guess?, that have built a loyal following of both fashion-conscious consumers and retailers who desire high quality, well designed products. We have selectively added the licensing rights to premier brands in women’s, men’s and team sports categories catering to a wide range of customers. In addition to our licensed brands, we own a number of proprietary brands, including DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, Eliza J, Jessica Howard, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc and Marc New York. Our experience in developing and acquiring licensed brands and proprietary labels, as well as our reputation for producing high quality, well-designed apparel, has led major department stores and retailers to select us as a designer and manufacturer for their own private label programs.
 We currently market apparel and other products under, among others, the following licensed and proprietary brand names:

 Diversified distribution base.   We market our products at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution, allowing us to provide products to a broad range of consumers. Our products are

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  sold to approximately 2,400 customers, including a cross section of retailers such as Macy’s, Hudson’s Bay Company, including their Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue divisions, Dillard’s, Nordstrom, JC Penney, Ross Stores, Burlington Coat Factory, and TJX Companies, as well as membership clubs such as Costco and Sam’s Club We have also increased sales to pure play online retail partners such as Amazon and Fanatics. Our strong relationships with retailers have been established through many years of personal customer service and adherence to meeting or exceeding retailer expectations. 
 In addition to selling our products through a diverse range of other retailers, we also have our own retail channel. While we continue to believe that this represents an important form of diversification for us, and can provide a profitable distribution channel for our proprietary brands, we also recognize that the retail landscape continues to evolve, and we are changing our retail strategy to regain profitability in this segment going forward. We are in the process of executing a turn-around of this segment of our business, including the termination and renegotiation of long-term leases as they come up for renewal, overall cost cutting, improved merchandising strategies and re-purposing certain stores for our Karl Lagerfeld Paris or DKNY brands. 
 Superior design, sourcing and quality control.   Our in-house design and merchandising teams design substantially all of our licensed, proprietary and private label products. Our designers work closely with our licensors and private label customers to create designs and styles that represent the look they want. We have a network of worldwide suppliers that allows us to negotiate competitive terms without relying on any single vendor. In addition, we employ a quality control team and a sourcing group in China to ensure the quality of our products. We believe we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of our design capabilities, sourcing expertise, on-time delivery and high standards of quality control. 
 Leadership position in the wholesale business.   As one of the largest wholesalers of outerwear, dresses and sportswear, we are widely recognized within the apparel industry for our high-quality and well-designed products. Our expertise and reputation in designing, manufacturing and marketing apparel have enabled us to build strong customer relationships and to become one of the leading dress and sportswear suppliers in the United States over the past several years. We have also expanded into women’s performance wear and other apparel categories, as well as to non-apparel categories such as handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. 
 Experienced management team.   Our executive management team has worked together for a significant period of time and has extensive experience in the apparel industry. Morris Goldfarb, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has been with us for over 40 years. Sammy Aaron, our Vice Chairman and President, joined us in 2005 when we acquired Marvin Richards, Wayne S. Miller, our Chief Operating Officer, has been with us for 20 years, Neal S. Nackman, our Chief Financial Officer, has been with us for almost 15 years and Jeffrey Goldfarb, our Executive Vice President, has been with us for over 15 years. Our leadership team has demonstrated experience in successfully acquiring, managing, integrating and positioning new businesses having completed nine acquisitions and several joint ventures over the last thirteen years, while also adding numerous new licenses and licensed products. 
 Growth Strategy 
 Our goal is to continue to expand our position as an all-season diversified apparel and accessories company with a broad portfolio of brands that we offer in multiple channels of retail distribution through the following growth strategies: 
 Execute diversification initiatives.   We are continually seeking opportunities to produce products for all seasons. Over the past five years we have diversified through the acquisition and licensing of well-known brands. We have initiated the following key diversification efforts: 
 •

 In December 2016, we acquired DKI, which we believe owns some of the world’s most iconic and recognizable power brands, including DKNY and Donna Karan. The acquisition of DKI fits squarely into our strategy to diversify and expand our business. We intend to focus on the expansion of the DKNY brand, while also re-establishing Donna Karan and other associated brands. We have re-launched Donna Karan as an aspirational luxury brand that is priced above DKNY and targeted to fine department stores globally. We believe that we can also capitalize on

  significant, untapped global licensing potential in a number of categories. We plan to leverage our demonstrated ability to drive organic growth, identify and integrate acquisitions and develop talent throughout the organization to maximize the potential of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands. 
 •

 In February 2016, we expanded our relationship with Tommy Hilfiger through a new license for womenswear which includes sportswear, suit separates, dresses, performance wear and denim. These categories are in addition to our other licenses for Tommy Hilfiger dresses, men’s and women’s outerwear and luggage. We believe that Tommy Hilfiger is a classic American lifestyle brand. We intend to leverage our market expertise to help build sales of Tommy Hilfiger women’s apparel. 
 ​

 In February 2016, we expanded our partnership with respect to the Karl Lagerfeld brand through the acquisition of an approximately 19% minority interest in the parent company of the group that holds the worldwide rights to the Karl Lagerfeld brand. In June 2015, we entered into a joint venture pursuant to which we acquired a 49% ownership interest in an entity that holds brand rights to the Karl Lagerfeld trademarks, including the Karl Lagerfeld Paris brand that we currently use, for consumer products (with certain exceptions) and apparel in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We were also the first licensee of the joint venture, having been granted a license for women’s apparel, women’s handbags, women’s and men’s footwear, and men’s apparel. 
 ​
 •

 We have continually expanded our relationship with Calvin Klein, our most important license relationship. Initially, we had licenses for Calvin Klein men’s and women’s outerwear. Between 2005 and 2013, we added licenses for women’s suits, dresses, women’s performance wear, women’s better sportswear, men’s and women’s swimwear, women’s handbags and small leather goods and luggage, as well as to operate Calvin Klein Performance retail stores in the United States. In March 2014, the term of each of our Calvin Klein license agreements was extended to December 31, 2023. 
 ​
 Partnering to increase business.   In growing our business, we seek to join forces with partners that can best help us achieve increased sales. For example, 
 •

 In August 2017, we entered into a joint venture with Amlon Capital B.V. to produce and market women’s and men’s apparel and accessories pursuant to a long-term license for DKNY and Donna Karan in the People’s Republic of China, including Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We own 49% of the joint venture, with Amlon owning the remaining 51%. The principals of Amlon were formerly executives of Tommy Hilfiger and were instrumental in the expansion of the Tommy Hilfiger brand in China. Starting January 1, 2018, this joint venture is the exclusive seller of women’s and men’s apparel, handbags, luggage and certain accessories under the DKNY and Donna Karan brands in the territory. The joint venture commenced operations in the second half of fiscal 2018 and was operating 13 stores as of January 31, 2018. 
 ​
 •

 In March 2017, we entered into an agreement with Macy’s under which Macy’s serves, since February 2018, as the exclusive U.S. department store for sales of DKNY women’s apparel and accessories. Under the agreement, Macy’s has the exclusive rights to sell DKNY women’s apparel, including women’s sportswear, dresses, suit separates, women’s performance wear, denim, swimwear and outerwear, handbags and women’s shoes, as well as men’s swimwear and outerwear and luggage in all Macy’s locations and on Macys.com. The agreement also plans for increased and enhanced DKNY shop-in-shops in many Macy’s stores. G-III and Macy’s are committed to making DKNY the premier fashion and lifestyle brand. Products outside the exclusive categories and products distributed by DKNY’s various licensees under other categories will continue to be sold to department stores, including Macy’s. 
 ​
 Grow our apparel business through power brands.   We have been a leader in the apparel business for many years and believe we can continue to grow our apparel business that is anchored by five power brands. Specifically, our Calvin Klein businesses benefit from Calvin Klein’s strong brand awareness and loyalty among consumers. Most recently, we acquired the Donna Karan business, including the DKNY brand, and added licenses for womenswear, outerwear and dresses under the Tommy Hilfiger brand. We are also developing Karl Lagerfeld Paris into an additional power brand sold by us.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Grow our licensing business.   As we have increased our portfolio of proprietary brands, we have licensed these brands in new categories. We began licensing Vilebrequin and G.H. Bass in selected categories after acquiring these brands in 2012 and 2013, respectively. We expect to significantly increase our licensing program as a result of our ownership of the Donna Karan and DKNY brands. Donna Karan and DKNY are two of the world’s most iconic and recognizable power brands. We believe that we can capitalize on significant, untapped global licensing potential in a number of men’s categories, as well as in home and jewelry. G-III intends to grow royalty streams through expansion of additional categories with existing Donna Karan and DKNY licensees, as well as new categories with new licensees. We also plan to continue seeking licensing opportunities for other brands we own such as G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc and Vilebrequin. 
 Add new product categories.   We have been able to leverage our expertise and experience in the apparel business, our relationships with our licensors and our sourcing capabilities to expand our licenses to new product categories such as dresses, sportswear, women’s suits, women’s performance wear, footwear and men’s and women’s swimwear. We expanded our licenses with Calvin Klein beyond apparel categories to include women’s handbags, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. In addition, we added luggage to the products we sell under the Tommy Hilfiger brand and added swimwear, resort wear and related accessories as a result of our acquisition of Vilebrequin. Our acquisition of G.H. Bass added footwear to our product mix. We will attempt to expand our distribution of products in these and other categories under licensed brands, our own brands, including the recently acquired Donna Karan brands, and private label brands. 
 Products — Development and Design 
 G-III designs, manufactures and markets women’s and men’s apparel at a wide range of retail price points. Our product offerings primarily include outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women’s suits and women’s performance wear. We also market footwear and accessories including women’s handbags, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. 
 G-III’s licensed apparel consists of both women’s and men’s products in a broad range of categories. See “Business — Licensing.” Our strategy is to seek licenses that will enable us to offer a range of products targeting different price points and different distribution channels. We also offer a wide range of products under our own proprietary brands. 
 We work with a diversified group of retail chains, such as Costco, Christopher A. Banks, Express, Harley Davidson, JC Penney and Ross Stores in developing product lines that are sold under their private label programs. Our design teams collaborate with our customers to produce custom-made products for department and specialty chain stores. Store buyers may provide samples to us or may select styles already available in our showrooms. We believe we have established a reputation among these buyers for our ability to produce high quality product on a reliable, expeditious and cost-effective basis. 
 Our in-house designers are responsible for the design and look of our licensed, proprietary and private label products. We work closely with our licensors to create designs and styles for each of our licensed brands. Licensors generally must approve products to be sold under their brand names prior to production. We maintain a global pulse on styles, using trend services and color services to enable us to quickly respond to style changes in the apparel industry. Our experienced design personnel and our focused use of outside services enable us to incorporate current trends and consumer preferences in designing new products and styles. 
 Our design personnel meet regularly with our sales and merchandising departments, as well as with the design and merchandising staffs of our licensors, to review market trends, sales results and the popularity of our latest products. In addition, our representatives regularly attend trade and fashion shows and shop at fashion forward stores in the United States, Europe and the Far East for inspiration. Our designers present sample items along with their evaluation of the styles expected to be in demand in the United States. We also seek input from selected customers with respect to product design. We believe that our sensitivity to the needs of retailers, coupled with the flexibility of our production capabilities and our continual monitoring of the retail market, enables us to modify designs and order specifications in a timely fashion. 
 Wholesale Operations 
 Our wholesale operations segment includes sales of products licensed by us from third parties, as well as sales of products under our own proprietary brands and private label brands. Revenues from our

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  wholesale operations accounted for 83.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to 81.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 and 79.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2016. Revenues from the wholesale operations of DKI are included for the last two months of fiscal 2017 and all of fiscal 2018. 
Licensed Products 
 The sale of licensed products is a key element of our strategy and we have continually expanded our offerings of licensed products for more than 20 years. In September 2017, we renewed our license agreements with Levi’s and Dockers for an additional four-year term. We also recently extended our license agreements with the National Basketball Association and for Vince Camuto dresses through 2020. In July 2016, we signed a three-year extension through March 2020 of our license agreement with the National Football League. We expanded our relationship with Tommy Hilfiger to include a license for womenswear in February 2016. 
 The following table sets forth, for each of our principal licenses, the date on which the current term ends and the date on which any potential renewal term ends.

 Under our license agreements, we are generally required to achieve minimum net sales of licensed products, pay guaranteed minimum royalties, make specified royalty and advertising payments (usually based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products), and receive prior approval of the licensor as to all design and other elements of a product prior to production. License agreements also may restrict our ability to enter into other license agreements for competing products or acquire businesses that produce competing products without the consent of the licensor. If we do not satisfy any of these requirements or otherwise fail to meet our obligations under a license agreement, a licensor usually will have the right to terminate our license. License agreements also typically restrict our ability to assign or transfer the agreement without the prior written consent of a licensor and generally provide that a change in control, including as a result of the acquisition of us by another company, is considered to be a transfer of the license agreement that would give a licensor the right to terminate the license unless it has approved the transaction. 
 Our ability to renew the current term of a license agreement may be subject to the discretion of the licensor or to attaining minimum sales and/or royalty levels and to our compliance with the provisions of the agreement. We believe that brand owners are looking to consolidate the number of licensees they engage to develop product and to choose licensees who have a successful track record of developing brands. We continue to seek other opportunities to enter into license agreements in order to expand our product offerings under well-known labels and broaden the markets that we serve. 
 Proprietary Brands 
 Dating back to the beginning of our company, G-III has sold apparel under our own proprietary brands. Over the years, we developed or acquired brands such as G-III Sports by Carl Banks, Eliza J, Jessica Howard and Andrew Marc. We acquired G.H. Bass, a well-known heritage brand, and Vilebrequin, which provides us with a premier brand selling status products worldwide. Most recently, we acquired DKI, which owns Donna Karan and DKNY, two of the world’s most iconic and recognizable power brands. 
 As we have increased our portfolio of proprietary brands, we have licensed these brands in a growing group of categories. We began licensing Andrew Marc, Vilebrequin and G.H. Bass in selected categories after acquiring these brands in 2008, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Our licensing program has significantly increased as a result of owning the Donna Karan and DKNY brands. 
 Donna Karan and DKNY
 The DKI business has a portfolio of some of the world’s most iconic fashion brands, including DKNY and Donna Karan. First launched in 1984, DKI designs, sources, markets, retails, and distributes collections of women’s and men’s clothing, sportswear, accessories and shoes under the DKNY and Donna Karan brand names. 
 Based on Donna Karan’s and DKNY’s significant brand equity, we believe there are opportunities to expand existing categories, launch new initiatives and develop a strong licensing and distribution base. We believe that the DKNY brand has the potential for significant growth. In addition, other areas for growth include the relaunch of Donna Karan Collection, as well as increased licensing revenues. We expect sales growth across multiple categories, led by sportswear, jeans and footwear. 
 The distribution agreement we signed with Macy’s in March 2017 for DKNY provides us with the opportunity to distribute through Macy’s retail network a total wardrobe for a woman’s active, modern lifestyle. Products developed reflect the DKNY brand DNA and emphasize a strong price-value relationship. We believe that DKNY has the potential to be the premier fashion and lifestyle brand.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Products outside of women’s apparel and accessories and all products distributed by DKNY’s various licensees will continue to be sold to a broad range of department stores, including Macy’s. G-III will also maintain DKNY’s agreements with international brand partners and distributors outside of the United States. 
 We believe that the Donna Karan brand offers significant growth potential. We re-launched Donna Karan as an aspirational luxury brand that is priced above DKNY and targeted to fine department stores located in the United States, such as Lord & Taylor, Dillard’s, Bloomingdales, Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom, as well as, fine department stores overseas, such as Harvey Nichols in the UK. 
 We currently license the DKNY brand for a broad array of products including fragrance, watches, hosiery, intimates, eyewear, children’s clothing, home furnishings, sleepwear and men’s tailored clothing. We have strong relationships with category leading license partners, including Estee Lauder, Fossil, PVH Corp. (“PVH”) and Hanesbrands. We recently licensed DKNY and Donna Karan men’s and women’s apparel and accessories in China pursuant to a long-term license agreement with a joint venture of which we are a 49% owner. We also recently signed license agreements for the DKNY brand in North America for men’s sportswear, men’s dress shirt, ties, small leather goods, men’s belts, fashion jewelry and children’s apparel, as well as a license agreement in North America for the DKNY and Donna Karan brands for women’s belts and cold weather accessories. We intend to focus on the expansion of licensing opportunities for the DKNY brand, while also re-establishing Donna Karan and other associated brands. We believe there is untapped global licensing potential in several men’s categories, as well as home and jewelry. G-III intends to grow royalty streams through expansion of additional categories with existing licensees, as well as new categories with new licensees. 
 The acquisition of DKI also strengthened our online retail channels and brick-and-mortar store base. We believe there are significant opportunities to focus and enhance the DKNY and Donna Karan websites, prudently expand retail stores over the long term, including through conversion of stores within the existing G-III retail base, and capitalize on industry relationships to ensure premium placement for certain product categories in department and other retail stores nationwide. The distribution agreement we signed with Macy’s provides us with the opportunity to bring together DKNY’s remarkable global brand recognition and Macy’s footprint as one of the largest nationwide retailers. 
 Vilebrequin
 Vilebrequin is a premier provider of status swimwear, resort wear and related accessories. Vilebrequin sells its products in over 60 countries around the world. Vilebrequin has also licensed its brand for the wholesale distribution of watches and sunglasses. We believe that Vilebrequin has the potential to significantly develop its distribution network worldwide and expand its product offerings. A majority of Vilebrequin’s current revenues are derived from sales in Europe and the United States. As of January 31, 2018, Vilebrequin products were distributed through 91 company-operated stores, plus e-commerce websites in each of Europe and the United States, as well as through 66 franchised locations and select wholesale distribution. 
 Vilebrequin’s iconic designs and reputation are linked to its French Riviera heritage arising from its founding in St. Tropez over forty years ago. Vilebrequin’s men’s swimwear, which accounts for the majority of its sales, is known for its exclusive prints, wide range of colors, attention to detail, fabric quality and well-designed cut. In addition to swimwear, Vilebrequin sells a line of resort wear products, including shirts, T-shirts, Bermuda shorts and trousers, and related accessories, including hats, beach bags, beach towels, shoes, sunglasses and watches. Vilebrequin also offers a collection of women’s swimwear and resort wear. We believe that Vilebrequin is a powerful brand. We plan to continue adding more company operated and franchised retail locations and increase our wholesale distribution of Vilebrequin product throughout the world, as well as develop the business beyond its heritage in men’s swimwear, resort wear and related accessories. 
 Retail Operations 
 We are a national retailer of outerwear, apparel, footwear and accessories in the United States. As of January 31, 2018, our retail operations segment consisted of 367 leased retail stores, of which 165 are stores operated under our Wilsons Leather name, 139 are stores operated under our G.H. Bass brand, 51 stores 

 12

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  are operated under our DKNY brand, 8 stores are operated under the licensed Karl Lagerfeld Paris brand and 4 stores are operated under the licensed Calvin Klein Performance brand. Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass, DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris each operate their own online store. 
 Substantially all of our Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and DKNY stores are operated as outlet stores and located in larger outlet centers. Wilsons Leather stores average approximately 3,605 square feet, G.H. Bass stores average approximately 5,887 square feet and DKNY stores average approximately 3,686 square feet. Given the current retail environment, we are focusing on turning around our retail business by not renewing long-term leases as they come up for renewal if we are unable to satisfactorily renegotiate the terms of those leases. In addition, we are implementing cost-cutting initiatives, revising our merchandising strategy and repurposing certain Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass stores for the Karl Lagerfeld Paris or DKNY brands. We intend to continue our program of door count reduction and to increase the efficiency and productivity of our retail operations. 
 At the beginning of fiscal 2018, we operated 411 retail stores across our Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass, DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld Paris and Calvin Klein Performance brands. At January 31, 2018, the store count for these brands had decreased to 367 locations. We expect to further reduce the number of stores and anticipate closing approximately 65 to 70 stores by the end of fiscal 2019. 
 Our Wilsons Leather retail stores primarily sell men’s and women’s outerwear and accessories. Outerwear sold in our Wilsons Leather stores includes both products sold to us by G-III’s wholesale operations segment, as well as products sourced by us. Accessories are purchased from third parties. Our G.H. Bass stores offer casual and dress shoes for men and women under our G.H. Bass brand. Most of our G.H. Bass stores also carry apparel under its brand for men and women, including tops, bottoms and outerwear, as well as accessories such as handbags, wallets, belts and travel gear. We sell G.H. Bass products through outlet stores located in the United States. Our DKNY stores offer a large range of products including sportswear, dresses, suit separates, outerwear, handbags, footwear, intimates, sleepwear, hosiery, watches and eyewear. Merchandise is shipped from our main Brooklyn Park, Minnesota distribution center, as well as four regional distribution centers, to replenish stores as needed with key styles and to build inventory for the peak holiday selling season. 
 Our sales of apparel on e-commerce websites continue to increase. Our e-commerce business consists of our own web platforms at www.dkny.com, www.donnakaran.com, www.wilsonsleather.com, www.ghbass.com, www.vilebrequin.com and www.andrewmarc.com. We are building an e-commerce team to help us expand our online opportunities going forward. We also sell our Karl Lagerfeld Paris products on its website, www.karllagerfeldparis.com. We sell our licensed products over the web through retail partners such as Macys.com and Nordstrom.com, each of which has a significant online business. We have also increased sales to pure play online retail partners such as Amazon and Fanatics. We continue to develop additional marketing initiatives over the Internet, our web sites and social media to increase our e-commerce presence. 
 Revenues from our retail operations, before intercompany eliminations, accounted for 17.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to 19.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 and 20.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2016. Revenues from DKNY’s retail operations are included for the last two months of fiscal 2017 and all of fiscal 2018. 
 Manufacturing and Sourcing 
 G-III wholesale operations and retail operations segments arrange for the production of products from independent manufacturers located primarily in China and, to a lesser extent, in Vietnam, Indonesia, Jordan, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Central and South America. Vilebrequin’s products are manufactured in Bulgaria, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, China and Romania. A small portion of our garments is manufactured in the United States. 
 We currently have representative offices in Hangzhou, Nanjing, Qingdao and Dongguan, China, as well as in Vietnam and Indonesia. These offices act as our liaison with manufacturers in the Far East. As of January 31, 2018, we had 435 employees in these representative offices. 

 13

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  G-III’s headquarters provides these liaison offices with production orders stating the quantity, quality, delivery time and types of garments to be produced. The personnel in our liaison offices assist in the negotiation and placement of orders with manufacturers. In allocating production among independent suppliers, we consider a number of criteria, including, but not limited to, quality, availability of production capacity, pricing and ability to meet changing production requirements. 
 To facilitate better service for our customers and accommodate the volume of manufacturing in the Far East, we also have a subsidiary in Hong Kong. Our Hong Kong subsidiary supports third party production of products on an agency fee basis. Our Hong Kong office acts as an agent for substantially all of our production. Our China and Hong Kong offices monitor production at manufacturers’ facilities to ensure quality control, compliance with our specifications and timely delivery of finished garments to our distribution facilities and, in some cases, direct to our customers. At January 31, 2018, we had 57 employees in our Hong Kong office. 
 In connection with the foreign manufacture of our products, manufacturers purchase raw materials including fabric, wool, leather and other submaterials (such as linings, zippers, buttons and trim) at our direction. Prior to commencing the manufacture of products, samples of raw materials or submaterials are sent to us for approval. We regularly inspect and supervise the manufacture of our products in order to ensure timely delivery, maintain quality control and monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications. We also inspect finished products at the factory site. 
 We generally arrange for the production of products on a purchase order basis with completed products manufactured to our design specifications. We assume the risk of loss predominantly on a Freight-On-Board (F.O.B.) basis when goods are delivered to a shipper and are insured against casualty losses arising during shipping. 
 As is customary, we have not entered into any long-term contractual arrangements with any contractor or manufacturer. We believe that the production capacity of foreign manufacturers with which we have developed, or are developing, a relationship is adequate to meet our production requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that alternative foreign manufacturers are readily available. 
 A majority of all finished goods manufactured for us is shipped to our distribution facilities or to designated third party facilities for final inspection, allocation, and reshipment to customers. The goods are delivered to our customers and us by independent shippers. We choose the form of shipment (principally ship, truck or air) based upon a customer’s needs, cost and timing considerations. 
 Customs and Import Restrictions 
 Our arrangements with textile manufacturers and suppliers are subject to requisite customs clearances for textile apparel and the imposition of export duties. United States Customs duties on our textile apparel presently range from duty free to 32%, depending upon the type of fabric used, how the garment is constructed and the country of export. A substantial majority of our product is imported into the United States and, to a lesser extent, into Canada and Europe. Countries in which our products are sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls or restrictions or adjust prevailing duty or tariff levels, as well as quota restrictions. Any action by the executive branch of the United States government to increase tariffs on imported goods, such as the recent tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum and the possible imposition of tariffs on goods imported from China, could adversely affect our business. Under the provisions of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) agreement governing international trade in textiles, known as the “WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,” the United States and other WTO member countries have eliminated quotas on textiles and apparel-related products from WTO member countries. As a result, quota restrictions generally do not affect our business in most countries. 
 Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to regulations that relate to product labeling, content and safety requirements, licensing requirements and flammability testing. We believe that we are in compliance with those regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Raw Materials 
 We purchase substantially all of the products manufactured for us on a finished goods basis. We coordinate the sourcing of raw materials used in the production of our products, which are generally available from numerous sources. The apparel industry competes with manufacturers of many other products for the supply of raw materials. 
Marketing and Distribution 
 G-III’s products are sold primarily to department, specialty and mass merchant retail stores in the United States. We sell to approximately 2,400 customers, ranging from national and regional chains to small specialty stores. We also distribute our products through our retail stores and, to a lesser extent, through our DKNY, Donna Karan, Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass, Vilebrequin and Andrew Marc websites, the Karl Lagerfeld Paris website, and the websites of our retail partners such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Amazon and Fanatics. 
 Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 63.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to 64.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 and 63.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2016. Sales to Macy’s, which includes sales to its Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s store chains, as well as through macys.com, accounted for an aggregate of 22.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to 21.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 and 20.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2016. Sales to Macy’s will likely increase as a percentage of our net sales as a result of our expanded license agreement with Tommy Hilfiger and sales of DKNY product to Macy’s, including as a result of the agreement that provides Macy’s with the exclusive right to sell DKNY women’s apparel and accessories since February 2018. The loss of this customer or a significant reduction in purchases by our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 A substantial majority of our sales are made in the United States. We also market our products in Canada, Europe and the Far East, which, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 12.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to 8.6% of our net sales in Fiscal 2017. See Note K to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information with respect to revenues and long-lived assets attributed by geographic region. 
 Our products are sold primarily through a direct sales force consisting of 285 employees at January 31, 2018. Our principal executives are also actively involved in sales of our products. Some of our products are also sold by independent sales representatives located throughout the United States. The Canadian market is serviced by a sales and customer service team based both in the United States and in Canada. Sales outside of the United States are managed by 31 salespeople located in our offices across Asia. At January 31, 2018, we employed 7 salespeople located in Canada with respect to sales of Kensie product and Vilebrequin employed 27 salespeople, most of whom are located across Europe. 
 Brand name products sold by us pursuant to a license agreement are promoted by institutional and product advertisements placed by the licensor. Our license agreements generally require us to pay the licensor a fee, based on a percentage of net sales of licensed product, to pay for a portion of these advertising costs. We may also be required to spend a specified percentage of net sales of a licensed product on advertising placed by us. 
 Our marketing and press efforts on behalf of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands are highly focused around communicating brand DNA and visual identity for the new evolution of DKNY and Donna Karan. We are re-building the brand image through high impact ad campaigns that feature socially relevant talent. We are striving to create noteworthy marketing initiatives, collaborations and image programs to build brand awareness and bring in a new young customer. Donna Karan and DKNY will continue to support global licensees with brand campaigns and product images to tell the brand story. We expect to invest in digital media and storytelling for brand amplification and to establish comprehensive commercial marketing tools that will support our global wholesale and retail channels. 
 Marketing efforts by Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass are primarily focused on increasing store traffic and then converting customers to buyers. This goal is mainly accomplished through our customer relations programs, local advertising and mall marketing promotions along with marketing initiatives through the Internet, social media and public relations support. We continue to revitalize and build the G.H. Bass heritage brand through products featuring new design and comfort technology, improved assortments and additional category licenses with strong partners.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Vilebrequin’s marketing efforts have been based on continually offering new swimwear prints and expanding the range of its products to new categories such as women’s swimwear, ready-to-wear and accessories. Besides its traditional advertising networks (print and outdoor advertising), Vilebrequin is seeking to develop new marketing channels through the use of digital media, product placement and public relations. Through the growth of its network of stores, distributors and franchisees, Vilebrequin is seeking to reinforce its position in its traditional markets, such as the United States, Europe and the Middle East, and to develop new markets in Asia. 
 We advertise our Andrew Marc and Marc New York brands and are engaged in both cooperative advertising programs with retailers and direct to the consumer. Our marketing strategy is focused on media, public relations and channel marketing. Our media strategy for Andrew Marc includes traditional print, such as catalogs, and outdoor advertising, as well as digital and social media initiatives. 
 We believe we have developed awareness of our other owned labels primarily through our reputation, consumer acceptance and the fashion press. We primarily rely on our reputation and relationships to generate business in the private label portion of our wholesale operations segment. We believe we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of, among other things, our standards of quality control, on-time delivery, competitive pricing and willingness and ability to assist customers in their merchandising of our products. 
 Seasonality 
 Retail sales of apparel have traditionally been seasonal in nature. Historically, our wholesale business has been dependent on our sales to retailers from July through November. Net sales in the months of July through November accounted for approximately 54% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, and 57% of our net sales in fiscal 2016. We are highly dependent on our results of operations during the second half of our fiscal year. The second half of the year is expected to continue to provide a larger amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our net income for the foreseeable future. 
Order Book 
 A portion of our orders consists of short-term purchase orders from customers who place orders on an as-needed basis. Information relative to open purchase orders at any date may also be materially affected by, among other things, the timing of the initial showing of apparel to the trade, as well as by the timing of recording of orders and shipments. As a result, we do not believe that disclosure of the amount of our unfilled customer orders at any time is meaningful. 
Competition 
 We have numerous competitors with respect to the sale of our products, including brand owners, distributors that import products from abroad, and domestic retailers with established foreign manufacturing capabilities. Some of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources and greater manufacturing capacity than we do. Our retail business competes against a diverse group of retailers, including, among others, other outlet stores, department stores, specialty stores, warehouse clubs and e-commerce retailers. Sales of our products are affected by style, price, quality, brand reputation and general fashion trends. 
Trademarks 
 We own some of the trademarks used by us in connection with our wholesale operations segment, as well as almost all of the trademarks used in our retail operations segment. We act as licensee of certain trademarks owned by third parties that are used in connection with our wholesale operations segment. The principal brands that we license are summarized under the heading “Licensing” above. We own a number of proprietary brands that we use in connection with our business and products including, among others, DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, Eliza J, Jessica Howard, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc, Marc New York and G-III Sports by Carl Banks. We have registered, or applied for registration of, many of our trademarks in multiple jurisdictions for use on a variety of apparel and related other products. 

 16

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  In markets outside of the United States, our rights to some of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our attempt to expand into foreign markets, we may experience conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks that would impede our use and registration of some of our trademarks. Such conflicts may arise from time to time as we pursue international expansion. Although we have not in the past suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets or in new product categories, we cannot be sure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional brands to new markets. 
 We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that they have value in the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement. 
 Employees 
 As of January 31, 2018, we had 9,071 employees, of whom 653 worked in executive or administrative capacities, 1,527 worked in design, merchandising and sourcing, 809 worked in warehouse and distribution facilities, 285 worked in wholesale sales, and 5,797 worked in our retail stores. Additionally, during our peak retail selling season from October through January, we employed approximately 1,780 additional seasonal associates in our retail stores. We employ both union and non-union personnel and believe that our relations with our employees are good. We have not experienced any interruption of our operations due to a labor disagreement with our employees. 
 G-III is a party to an agreement with a labor union. As of January 31, 2018, this agreement covers approximately 420 of our full-time employees, most of whom work in our warehouses located in New Jersey, and is currently in effect through November 15, 2020. Through its membership in an association, G-III’s subsidiary, The Donna Karan Company LLC, is a party to an agreement with the same union. The Donna Karan agreement covers approximately 27 full time employees, most of whom work in their warehouse in New Jersey. This agreement is currently in effect through May 31, 2019. 
 The Donna Karan Company LLC is also a party to an agreement with another labor union. As of January 31, 2018, this agreement covers approximately 8 of our full-time employees, most of whom work as pattern makers in our New York offices. The agreement is currently in effect through May 31, 2019.
