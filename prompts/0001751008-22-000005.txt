Item 1. Business
Our mission is to grow the mobile app ecosystem by enabling the success of mobile app developers.
Our software solutions provide advanced tools for mobile app developers to grow their businesses by automating and optimizing the marketing and monetization of their apps. Our software, coupled with our deep industry knowledge and expertise, has allowed us to rapidly scale a successful and diversified portfolio of owned mobile apps. We have also accelerated our market penetration through an active acquisition and partnership strategy. Our scaled and integrated business model sits at the nexus of the mobile app ecosystem, which creates a durable competitive advantage that has fueled our clients’ success and our strong growth.
Over the past two decades, mobile apps have become integral to our lives. Mobile apps offer a wide array of applications, such as allowing users to seamlessly share ideas, make purchases, monitor health, and access entertainment. Growth of the mobile app ecosystem benefits mobile app users, but makes it harder for mobile app developers, and particularly indie developers, to scale and succeed in a crowded market. Most developers lack access to the marketing, monetization, and data analytics tools required to stand out among millions of competing mobile apps or attract sufficient numbers of mobile app users to create and sustain a successful long-term business. 
The marketing and monetization challenges faced by mobile app developers are particularly acute for developers of mobile games, which is one of the largest and fastest-growing segments within the mobile app ecosystem. 
AppLovin is critical to the success of mobile app developers, in particular mobile game developers, solving key marketing and monetization challenges. Through our technologies and scaled distribution, developers are able to manage, optimize, and analyze their marketing investments, and improve the monetization of their apps. The key elements of our solutions are delivered through the AppLovin Core Technologies and AppLovin Software Platform:
•AppLovin Core Technologies: Our foundational technology infrastructure which powers our Software Platform and, in turn, our Apps. Our Core Technologies consist of our AXON machine-learning recommendation engine, our App Graph, and our elastic cloud infrastructure. Our App Graph stores and manages anonymized data from hundreds of millions of mobile devices we reach every day, which our AXON engine then leverages to better predict and match users to relevant advertising content.
•AppLovin Software Platform: A comprehensive suite of tools for developers to get their mobile apps discovered and downloaded by the right users, optimize return on marketing spend, and maximize monetization of engagement. Our Software Platform is comprised of three solutions:
•AppDiscovery, our marketing software solution, is the cornerstone of our Software Platform, augmented by our rapidly growing MAX monetization solution. AppDiscovery is powered by AXON and provides the technology to match advertiser demand with publisher supply through auctions at vast scale and microsecond- level speeds.
•Adjust is our SaaS mobile marketing platform which allows marketers to make smarter decisions through measurement, attribution, and fraud prevention.
•MAX utilizes an advanced in-app bidding technology that optimizes the value of a developer’s advertising inventory by running a real-time competitive auction, driving more competition, and higher returns for publishers.
In 2018, given an opportunity to scale our own apps using our Software Platform, insights, and expertise in the mobile app ecosystem, we launched our first-party content strategy, AppLovin Apps. Today, our Apps consist of a globally diversified portfolio of over 350 free-to-play mobile games across five genres, run by nineteen studios including studios that we own (Owned Studios) and others that we partner with (Partner Studios). Our Apps provide data and insights as users play games, thus improving our App Graph and AXON recommendation engine. Our studios generally focus on the 
development of easy to learn and play games, which appeal to a broad range of demographics, but also develop several games for other genres. 
The combination of our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps forms a strategic flywheel that drives growth across our business and furthers our competitive advantages. As more developers use our Software Platform to market and monetize their mobile apps, we gain access to more users and more user engagement further strengthening our scaled distribution. As our distribution grows, we gain better insights for our App Graph and AXON recommendation engine, which then further enhances our Software Platform. This continuously improving flywheel helps developers that use our Software Platform to create and sustain successful businesses, growing both our own business and the mobile app ecosystem.
We accelerate our capabilities and enhance our strategic position in the mobile app ecosystem by actively pursuing acquisitions and partnerships for new technologies and apps. Insights that we derive from our strategic position and flywheel allow us to proactively identify attractive acquisition and partnership opportunities across the mobile app ecosystem. From the beginning of 2018 through December 31, 2021, we have invested over $2.5 billion across 27 strategic acquisitions and partnerships with app studios, games, and software platforms. In the case of new apps, we are able to deploy our Software Platform and expertise to accelerate revenue growth, enabling us to target strong returns on investment. Strategic acquisitions and partnerships will continue to be a part of our growth strategy going forward.
How We Grow the Mobile App Ecosystem
We have built and invested in our Core Technologies and Software Platform, which expand the mobile app ecosystem by solving key developer growth challenges. We deliver value to mobile app developers by helping scale their businesses and maximize their revenue through our marketing and monetization technologies and expertise. Our Core Technologies and Software Platform combine marketing, monetization, and analytics into a single unified technology stack.
AppLovin’s Integrated Approach
AppLovin Core Technologies
Our Core Technologies are our foundational technology infrastructure, which powers our Software Platform and, in turn, our Apps. Our Core Technologies consist of our AXON machine-learning recommendation engine, our App Graph data management layer, and our elastic cloud infrastructure. Our Core Technologies catalogue and consolidate interactions every day into our proprietary App Graph. AXON receives information from our App Graph and uses its machine-learning algorithms to match each user to relevant advertising content, driving better engagement and monetization.
Our flexible, robust cloud infrastructure is the backbone of our Core Technologies. This proprietary system allows us to operate at massive scale and process significant data while maintaining a high degree of flexibility, so that we may keep pace with the ever-evolving needs of our customers. Our globally distributed data infrastructure ensures we are able to connect with devices worldwide and process aggregate user activity across our Software Platform.
AppLovin Software Platform
Our Software Platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools for developers to grow their businesses by automating and optimizing the marketing and monetization of their apps. This suite is made up of three key solutions:
•AppDiscovery is our marketing software solution, which matches advertiser demand with publisher supply through auctions at vast scale and microsecond-level speeds. AppDiscovery is powered by our AXON machine-
learning recommendation engine with predictive algorithms that enable developers to match their apps to users that are more likely to download them.
•Adjust is an analytics platform that helps marketers grow their mobile apps with solutions for measuring and optimizing campaigns and protecting user data. Adjust powers thousands of apps with built-in intelligence and automation, backed by responsive global customer support.
•MAX is our in-app bidding software that optimizes the value of an app’s advertising inventory by running a real-time competitive auction, driving more competition and higher returns for publishers. Many developers that integrate MAX have experienced a measurable increase in their average revenue per daily active user over traditional monetization tools and save countless hours because they are able to automate manual monetization work through its advanced feature set.
When deployed together, our Software Platform helps developers better reach and monetize a more precisely targeted and valuable user base.
Our Software Platform is delivered through an integrated and seamless user interface, allowing developers to accelerate their revenue opportunities, reduce the time they spend on marketing and monetization, and focus on what they do best—developing apps.
AppLovin Apps
Our Apps consist of a globally diversified portfolio of over 350 free-to-play mobile games run by nineteen studios with a deep bench of talented developers. Our diversified portfolio covers five gaming genres, the most frequent of which is casual games, and appeals to a broad global audience across different ages, genders, and locations.
Our Owned Studios and Partner Studios utilize our Software Platform to market and monetize our Apps. When using our Software Platform, our Apps have an economic advantage, which benefits our business as a whole. The strategy of our studios is to allow developers to focus on creating great Apps, while leveraging our Software Platform and expertise to unlock the potential of those Apps.
Our Strategic Flywheel
The mutually reinforcing combination of our Software Platform’s scaled distribution, our App’s first- party content, and our Core Technologies’ recommendation engine creates a powerful flywheel effect that enhances each component and importantly improves our overall strategic position and capabilities. As our Software Platform improves and is able to deliver more effective ads to more relevant users, more developers use and integrate their apps with our Software Platform, growing our scaled distribution. This grows the number of users on and level of engagement with our Apps and third-party apps. With a larger number of users engaged with our Software Platform and our Apps, our App Graph gains more insights and data. The enhanced App Graph feeds our Core Technologies, including our AXON machine-learning recommendation engine, improving its insights and matching capabilities. As the insights generated by AXON improve, the effectiveness of our Software Platform is enhanced in real-time. Improvements to our Software Platform lead to more developer demand, restarting the virtuous cycle of our strategic flywheel.
Our Software Platform benefits from more apps and users from both our Apps and those of third- party developers. Through more volume and strong underlying software, our Software Platform can better match and price the supply of advertising inventory and demand from advertisers, helping users discover the apps they love and delivering better returns for developers. Apps—whether third party or our own—benefit from the improved marketing and monetization capabilities of our Software Platform, driving growth in users and revenue. With greater scale and resources, developers can reinvest to create new apps, improve existing apps, and further invest in user acquisition, thereby growing the overall mobile app ecosystem.
We derive highly strategic insights from our flywheel. As the largest user of our Software Platform, our Apps benefit from the expertise and cost savings of our Software Platform, leading to greater returns on user acquisition spend. This allows our Apps to make significant investments in user acquisition, giving us further insights into the effectiveness of our tools and monetization strategies across the ecosystem.
Our Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships
We accelerate our technical capabilities, strategic positioning, and growth through strategic acquisitions and partnerships. We have developed a proven and repeatable process for acquiring highly sophisticated technology that enhances our Core Technologies and Software Platform and for selecting and scaling our Apps global portfolio. Our business sits at the nexus of the mobile app ecosystem, which gives us deep insights into potential acquisitions and partnerships. Additionally, as a first-hand participant in the mobile app ecosystem, we have developed a strong relationship with other participants, allowing us to more easily identify and enter into partnerships or acquire companies and technologies. Our acquisitions and partnerships include investments in software, such as our acquisitions of Adjust, MAX, MoPub, and SafeDK, and game studios, such as our acquisition of PeopleFun and partnership with Belka Games.
Our unique and active role in the ecosystem allows us to make informed, data-driven decisions regarding which tools best address developer pain points. As part of AppLovin, our strategic acquisitions and partnerships benefit from our software and expertise, typically achieving step-function improvements in performance. Once we have acquired or partnered with a studio, we allow the studio to maintain its creative autonomy and help the studio to manage its business needs by leveraging all of the tools and capabilities of our Core Technologies and Software Platform. Given our strategic insights and long-standing relationships with many game studios, we are able to identify highly attractive acquisitions and partnerships. From the beginning of 2018 through December 31, 2021, we have invested over $2.5 billion across 27 strategic acquisitions and partnerships in software and gaming.
Benefits to Mobile App Developers
We enable mobile app developers to:
•Reach and attract users at scale. Our Software Platform reaches millions of users per day, enabling developers to target and find the right users for their apps worldwide. Developers are able to set their user acquisition and revenue goals to target the most relevant, highest value users.
•Maximize monetization of engagement. Developers use our Software Platform to generate incremental revenue by maximizing the monetization of their mobile app ad inventory.

By integrating MoPub's reach and product features into our existing Software Platform, we expect to better maximize revenue growth and improve efficiencies for our combined customers.
•Grow AppLovin Apps. We intend to grow our AppLovin Apps portfolio by making appropriate user acquisition investments, using live-ops to enhance engagement and monetization of our Apps, and launching new titles.
•New market extensions. We believe our technology and expertise are applicable to other market segments and geographies that we do not currently address:
◦Expand into other mobile app segments and industries. Our long-term objective is to power and operate mobile apps across multiple verticals such as e-commerce, entertainment, and health and wellness. We believe our deep expertise and capabilities in the complex mobile gaming sector will allow us to successfully apply our technology in other verticals.
◦Geographic expansion and industry partnerships. We have a large international expansion opportunity given only 40% of our total revenue came from outside of the United States in 2021. To expand our reach, we plan to further invest in our sales and marketing to increase penetration among new and existing clients.
◦Other performance marketing and yield marketing categories. We believe our technology and expertise are applicable to other large and growing performance marketing categories beyond mobile apps.
•Pursue accretive strategic acquisitions and partnerships. Given our proven track record, long-standing relationships with key industry players, and reputation as a partner of choice, we have a deep pipeline of software and app investment opportunities which we will continue to pursue.
Our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps
We solve the marketing and monetization challenges facing mobile app developers through our Core Technologies and Software Platform. We help grow the worldwide mobile app ecosystem by enabling developers to scale their businesses while remaining focused on creating and improving their apps. We scale our own Apps by fully utilizing our Software Platform and expert insights, while continuously improving our software for the benefit of all developers.
AppLovin Core Technologies
Our Core Technologies power our client-facing Software Platform and consist of our AXON machine-learning recommendation engine, our App Graph, and a flexible, robust cloud infrastructure. The underlying elastic architecture is managed through multiple cloud providers and our own co-located data centers, handling massive amounts of data while remaining flexible enough to rapidly add new solutions and technology in response to changing market and customer needs. Our Core Technologies process device-level data from millions of devices. Our App Graph stores and manages this anonymized data allowing AXON to then leverage it to better predict and match users to relevant advertising content. These insights fuel our Software Platform, which better matches users to content and create a more personalized experience.
Our Software Platform also enables real-time auctions that optimize the value for each impression, while simultaneously enabling developers to attain an attractive value for each of the impressions from their inventory. The sum total of these mutually reinforcing software elements has created a robust and successful marketing and monetization engine that operates at high scale and speed.
AppLovin Software Platform
Our comprehensive Software Platform enables app developers to automate their mobile app marketing, engagement, and monetization efforts in three core ways. First, we provide marketing technology that allows developers to reach more of the most suitable users with personalized content, in order to increase the number of users who download and engage with their apps. Second, we provide developers with monetization and analytics technology to maximize the value of their inventory by obtaining a high price for each impression. Third, we provide developers a set of capabilities to optimize their apps and help streamline their businesses.
Our key Software Platform offerings are AppDiscovery, Adjust and MAX.
AppDiscovery
AppDiscovery is a suite of marketing solutions that enables developers to automate, optimize, and manage their marketing efforts. AppDiscovery is powered by machine-learning with predictive algorithms that enable developers to match their apps to users that are more likely to download them. This form of personalized advertising focuses on the end user, enabling the advertisers to find the right users and delivering to users more of what they are likely to be interested in. AppDiscovery leverages our AXON machine-learning recommendation engine to target the right users with the right marketing campaign, at scale. Advertisers not only attract users that download, but also find a high volume of users that stay and engage with their apps for greater retention and ultimately, increased opportunities for better monetization. Revenue from AppDiscovery comprises a vast majority of revenue from our Software Platform.
With AppDiscovery, advertisers can define the framework of their campaigns in the following ways:
•Reach: Advertisers identify what they are willing to pay to acquire their target users. Our technology finds the users at that value who are most likely to download and engage with the app.
•Global scale: Advertisers can choose to connect with users in different regions around the world, and our technology suggests the best locations based on their parameters.
•Retain and engage: Our algorithms automatically adjust based on the likelihood users will engage. Our clients can analyze by retention periods from initial app download onwards, so that advertisers understand the effectiveness of their marketing investments.
•Targeted returns: Advertisers set their goals and target return on ad sales and our algorithms adjust cost and campaign specifics to meet them.
AppDiscovery includes the following features:
•Advanced campaign management: An interface to create, manage, and automatically optimize campaigns based on return on ad sales goals.
•Real-time analytics: An interface to see results and optimize against them with our ROI-based analytics environment.
•Life-Time-Value (LTV) reporting: A tool that breaks down campaign results by source and location, allowing advertisers to make real-time, informed decisions about the value and longevity of their campaigns.
•High quality and quantity creatives: Advertisers can make and test as many creatives as needed. They also have access to our in-house creative team for expert ad creation and testing strategies.
Adjust
Adjust is our SaaS mobile marketing platform which allows clients to better understand their users’ journey while allowing marketers to make smarter decisions through measurement, attribution, and fraud prevention.
MAX
MAX is a suite of monetization solutions that optimize the value of a developer’s traffic by running a single unbiased auction in which advertisers bid simultaneously, driving more competition and higher prices for publishers. MAX auctions are more effective than historical tools and approaches because MAX yields more targeted users for advertisers and enables publishers to achieve better prices for each impression. MAX has become the preferred in-app bidding solution for many developers worldwide, helping drive meaningful growth and momentum for MAX.
MAX includes the following features:
•Advanced in-app bidding technology: MAX’s competitive auctions happen in real time with the most bidding platforms in the industry bidding simultaneously for developers’ inventory at high volume. The competitive global demand helps maximize average revenue per user on each impression with many developers experiencing a measurable increase when moving to MAX.
•Automated monetization: MAX saves developers time through its extensive suite of APIs for automation.
•Ad quality assurance and review: MAX drives superior user experience with exclusive features that automatically flag risky content to keep developers’ brands safe.
•Powerful insights: MAX helps developers better understand the LTV for each user and increase revenue to maximize yield for each ad opportunity.
AppLovin Apps
Today, our Apps consist of a globally diversified portfolio of over 350 free-to-play mobile games across five genres, run by nineteen studios located worldwide with a deep bench of talented developers. Our Owned Studios and Partner Studios have developed and published games across a number of genres including: casual, hypercasual, match-three, 
midcore, and card/casino. Our Apps contribute a highly predictable and diversified stream of revenue which we leverage to invest into acquiring more users and driving continued growth.
A diverse portfolio allows us to reach multiple user demographics and diversify our mobile game development across many different genres. We have a broad audience on our Apps and this allows our Software Platform to connect users to a wide range of content. Today, a large segment of our portfolio is casual games which have a lower risk of development and generally have more predictable revenue streams and return on investments. Casual games can be played a few minutes at a time and appeal to a wide range of users across many highly attractive demographics.
Our Owned Studios and Partner Studios leverage live ops to quickly iterate and increase in-game monetization by optimizing app economies and improving in-game conversion on items and offers. Our Software Platform and expertise provide analytical tools, testing capabilities, and other solutions such as distributed development, competitive insights, localizations resources, creative services to develop and test ads and resource centers to access design and development expertise.
We also provide a set of services that help both our Apps and third-party developers optimize their games and leverage our expertise to better streamline their business operations.
Competition
We operate in a fragmented mobile app ecosystem composed of divisions of large, well- established companies as well as privately-held companies. The large companies in our ecosystem may play multiple different roles given the breadth of their businesses.
•Advertisers typically engage with several advertising platforms and networks to purchase advertisements on mobile games and other mobile apps, looking to optimize their marketing investments. Such advertising platform companies vary in size and include players such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Unity Software, as well as various private companies. Several of these platforms, including Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Unity Software, are also our partners and clients.
•There are many companies that develop online and mobile games and other mobile apps. The larger gaming companies in our ecosystem include Activision Blizzard (Microsoft), Tencent, and Zynga (Take-Two Interactive), as well as other public and private companies. Many of these companies are also our partners and clients. We also expect new developers to enter the market and existing companies to allocate more resources to develop and market more mobile games and apps.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are:
•the ability to enhance and improve technologies and offerings;
•knowledge, expertise, and experience in the mobile app ecosystem;
•relationships with third parties in the mobile app ecosystem;
•the ability to reach and target a large number of users;
•the ability to identify and execute on strategic transactions;
•the ability to successfully launch and monetize mobile apps;
•the pricing and perceived value of offerings;
•brand and reputation; and
•ability to expand into new offerings and geographies.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.

Our AppLovin Values capture our company’s culture and guide our approach on how we build and grow our business with all stakeholders:
We seek excellence, together. We know that our customers trust us to deliver immersive experiences and best-in-class tools. We take this very seriously, challenging one another to always do better. We are our toughest critics and most loyal fans. While we value individual initiative, we collaborate to drive forward as one team.
We are tenacious, move fast, and deliver. We move quickly and intentionally. Together we set a fast pace with high expectations, and then move beyond. We leverage all of our resources so we do not miss opportunities and find ways to deliver exceptional solutions.
We operate with integrity and intellectual honesty. We may move quickly and deliver, but we do it the right way. We do what is fair and operate with integrity because that is always the best course for customers, partners and all other stakeholders.
We foster entrepreneurship to challenge what is next. Taking risks and embracing challenges are part of our DNA. We empower our employees to try new things, question others, and innovate. This opens doors to new opportunities, which leads to more successful outcomes.
We excel through our culture of equality. Diversity and inclusion are principles that guide how we build our teams, grow our employees, and develop our company. We celebrate different approaches, points of view, and our diverse voices. It connects us with the players, developers, and global communities we serve.
Our employees are a key reason for our success and are essential for our continued growth. We benefit from a distributed global workforce and we plan to continue investing in hiring employees in our many locations worldwide. Our culture, industry success, and competitive compensation enable us to successfully retain our employees and to effectively recruit and retain new talent. We were named one of the Hottest Adtech Companies of 2021 by Business Insider, as well as a Certified Great Place to Work in 2021 and 2022. The San Francisco Business Times and Silicon Valley Business Journal awarded us one of the Bay Area’s Best Places to Work in 2019, 2020, and 2021.
Research and Development
Continued investment in research and development is important to advancing our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps. These advancements are key to attaining our strategic objectives and meeting the evolving needs of our customers. The underlying elastic architecture of our Core Technologies allows us to create, test, and deploy new features rapidly while distributing them globally. We also continue to invest in new and existing Apps.
Our research and development team is working on cutting edge technologies, which allows us to attract top talent globally. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 864 employees, or 54% of our total headcount, involved in research and development and related activities. Our research and development organization is based in Palo Alto, California with additional resources around the world.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps, and to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating valid and enforceable third-party intellectual property. We seek to accomplish that objective by establishing intellectual property rights in and protecting those assets through a combination of patents, patent applications, registered and unregistered trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual measures. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors, such as our unique position in the mobile app ecosystem and as one of the largest mobile game publishers, our flywheel advantage, our expertise and determination of our employees, and the functionality and flexibility of our Core Technologies and Software Platform in an ever-evolving industry, are also key contributors to our success.
As of December 31, 2021, we owned the following trademarks related to the business: 63 registered trademarks in the United States, 16 pending trademark applications in the United States, as well as 647 registered trademarks in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and 71 pending trademark applications in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.applovin.com. Finally, as of December 31, 2021, we owned the following patents related to the business: 60 issued U.S. patents, 5 U.S. patent applications, 24 non-U.S. issued patents, and 22 non-U.S. pending patent applications. Our issued U.S. patents, and any patents that may issue from our pending applications, are scheduled to expire at dates ranging between 2022 and 2039, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or extensions. We have acquired a number of patents through our acquisitions that are not critical to the combined business on a post-closing basis. As such, we regularly review our patent portfolio, and have and expect to continue to abandon the prosecution of patents that are not critical to our operations. 
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives and maintain our competitive position. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our intellectual property or that it will provide any competitive advantage. We take steps to protect our proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, developers, and vendors, and generally limiting access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our Core Technologies, Software Platform, or Apps or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult and time consuming. Further, our intellectual property rights may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private 
parties in the United States. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property” for more information regarding risks related to intellectual property.
Employees and Additional Team Members
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 1,594 full-time employees located in fourteen countries. As a result of our 27 strategic acquisitions and partnerships, we also have access to approximately 2,721 additional team members, approximately 74% of whom are research and development resources and all of whom are located outside of the United States. Our geographic diversification enhances our ability to retain and attract highly skilled talent as well as manage our headcount costs. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 47% of our full-time employees were located outside of the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements, which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. We work to identify, attract, and retain employees who are aligned with and will help us progress towards our mission, and we seek to provide competitive cash and equity compensation.
Compliance with Government Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state, and international laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on mobile platforms, including those relating to privacy, data protection, and the use and protection of data from employees, users and others (including minors), the internet, behavioral advertising, mobile apps, content, advertising and marketing activities, sweepstakes and giveaways, and anti-corruption. Additional laws and regulations relating to these areas likely will be passed in the future, and these or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted or enforced in new or expanded manners, each of which could result in significant limitations on ways we can collect and process data of users, employees and others, communicate with users, and operate our business. New and evolving laws and regulations, and changes in their enforcement and interpretation, may require changes to our Core Technologies, Software Platform, Apps, or business practices, and may significantly increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. As our business expands to scale our Software Platform and include additional Apps, and our operations continue to expand internationally, our compliance requirements and costs may increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
The data we collect and otherwise process is integral to our Core Technologies, Software Platform and Apps, providing us with insights to improve our developer tools, to optimize app discovery and monetization and to improve our Apps. Our collection, use, receipt, and other processing of data in our business subjects us to numerous U.S. state and federal laws and regulations, and foreign laws and regulations, addressing privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, transfer, disclosure, protection and processing of certain types of data. Such regulations include, for example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act. We work to comply with, and to help allow developers and ecosystem partners to comply with, applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security. This helps underpin our strategy of building trust and providing a strong experience to ecosystem partners and clients. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to laws and regulations concerning privacy, information security, data protection, consumer protection, and protection of minors, and these laws and regulations are continually evolving. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations” for additional information about our approach to laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security.
