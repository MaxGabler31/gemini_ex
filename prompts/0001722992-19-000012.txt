Item 1. Business
THE COMPANY
We operate as an externally managed REIT formed in Maryland that invests in and manages a portfolio of single-tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the U.S. that is generally leased on a long-term, triple-net basis to tenants operating within retail, office, and industrial property types. 
We began operations through predecessor legal entities which were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Spirit. On May 31, 2018, Spirit completed the Spin-Off that resulted in our establishment as an independent, publicly traded company. The Spin-Off was effected by means of a pro rata distribution of SMTA common shares to Spirit shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of May 18, 2018. In conjunction with the Spin-Off, we and our Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirit, entered into an Asset Management Agreement under which our Manager provides external management of SMTA for a flat rate of $20 million per annum. As of December 31, 2018, we had no employees.
Our portfolio currently includes (i) Master Trust 2014, an asset-backed securitization trust which issues non-recourse asset-backed securities collateralized by commercial real estate, net-leases and mortgage loans, (ii) a portfolio of properties leased to Shopko encumbered with CMBS debt under the Shopko CMBS Loan Agreements, subject to the Shopko bankruptcy filing and subsequent foreclosure on the CMBS debt as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, (iii) a single distribution center property leased to a sporting goods tenant encumbered with CMBS debt, and (iv) a portfolio of 14 unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2018, our gross investment in real estate and loans totaled approximately $2.56 billion, representing investments in 876 owned properties (788 excluding properties leased to Shopko) and eight properties securing our mortgage loans. See Item 2. "Properties" for further information on our properties and tenants. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Shopko Bankruptcy Filing
On January 16, 2019, Shopko, our largest tenant, filed a petition for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). As of December 31, 2018, we received $42.1 million in annualized Contractual Rent from Shopko, which represented 17.9% of our total annualized Contractual Rent. As a consequence of the bankruptcy filing and the subsequent foreclosure by the Shopko Lenders on the majority of our Shopko assets, we do not expect to receive any additional cash flow going forward from any of the assets leased to Shopko, nor bear further meaningful expenses related to those assets. On March 18, 2019, Shopko announced that it would seek to liquidate its operations.
We also hold a secured loan previously made to Shopko with principal outstanding of $34.4 million as of December 31, 2018 (the "Shopko B-1 Term Loan"). While the outcome of the Shopko bankruptcy filing is uncertain and there can be no assurances that we will recover any amounts due to us under the Shopko B-1 Term Loan, we intend to pursue all of our rights and remedies in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings, with the goal of maximizing the receipt of amounts due to us under the Shopko B-1 Term loan.
Strategy Update
On January 16, 2019, in connection with Shopko filing for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, we announced that our Board of Trustees had elected to accelerate our strategic plan by initiating a process to explore strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value. Strategic alternatives to be considered may include, but are not limited to, a sale of the Company or the Master Trust 2014, a merger, the sale of the single distribution center property and other non-core assets, and the maximizing of recoveries in connection with the Shopko bankruptcy. We have not set a timetable for completion of the execution of any portion of this strategic plan, and there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction or other alternative.

Recent Financings
Shopko CMBS
On November 1, 2018, four indirectly wholly-owned, property-owning subsidiaries of the Company entered into a non-recourse mortgage loan agreement with an institutional lender and certain other lenders from time to time party thereto (the "Shopko Lenders"), in an aggregate amount of $165.0 million. The Company received net proceeds from this loan agreement of approximately $141.9 million after the payment of fees, expenses and required reserves. The loan was secured by a pledge of the equity in the four subsidiaries, which collectively hold 85 assets (83 owned properties and two seller-financed notes on properties) that are leased to Shopko. On November 27, 2018, SMTA, through the indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary that owns the four property-owning subsidiaries, entered into a non-recourse mezzanine loan agreement with the Shopko Lenders, pursuant to which $40.0 million of the original $165.0 million was carved out, resulting in no additional proceeds to SMTA (such mezzanine loan agreement, together with the original loan agreement, the “Shopko CMBS Loan Agreements”). The mezzanine loan was secured by an equity pledge of the indirect wholly-owned subsidiary that owns the four property-owning subsidiaries.
In connection with the Shopko CMBS Loan Agreements, SMTA entered into a customary non-recourse loan guaranty agreement, in favor of the Shopko Lenders, pursuant to which SMTA guaranteed the payment and performance of the liabilities of the property-owning subsidiaries under the non-recourse loan agreements for damages resulting from certain breaches or actions, including, but not limited to, fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the borrowers, and for the repayment in full of the debt in the event of certain actions, including, without limitation, certain bankruptcy events and prohibited transactions. 
On January 16, 2019, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries as borrowers under the Shopko CMBS Loan Agreements defaulted on the loans when those entities ceased to make interest payments as a result of Shopko ceasing to pay its rent obligations following its bankruptcy filing. The full principal amount of $157.4 million outstanding under the Shopko CMBS Loan Agreements immediately became due and payable, and interest is accruing at the default rate of LIBOR plus 12.5% on the original loan portion and LIBOR plus 18.0% on the mezzanine loan portion. On March 1, 2019, the Shopko Lenders foreclosed on the equity of the entity that owns the four property-owning subsidiaries. 
Variable Funding Notes
On November 1, 2018 (the “VFN Closing Date”), the Company completed the issuance of net-lease mortgage notes Series 2018-1, Class A (the “Variable Funding Notes” or "VFN"), which allow for the funding of up to $50.0 million of Variable Funding Notes within Master Trust 2014. Master Trust 2014 is comprised of five issuers, each an indirectly wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary of the Company. The VFN has been rated “A+” by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services. The VFN was sold in reliance on certain exemptions from registration under the Securities Act. The VFN may only be acquired by qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption under the Securities Act. Prior to the VFN Closing Date, Master Trust 2014 had existing notes that are secured by the same collateral as the VFN, which had approximately $1.95 billion in aggregate outstanding principal as of the VFN Closing Date.

Real Estate Portfolio Activities
Concentration
During the year ended December 31, 2018, no tenant, excluding Shopko, exceeded 7.0% of our Contractual Rent and no one single property contributed more than 7.0% of our Contractual Rent. See Item 2. “Properties" for further information on our ten largest tenants and the composition of our tenant base.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased nine properties, representing an aggregate gross investment of $112.6 million, and invested $2.6 million in revenue producing capital expenditures on existing properties. During the same period, we sold 47 properties for $91.0 million in gross sales proceeds. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of our investments.

Declaration of Quarterly and Special Dividend
On December 5, 2019, we announced that our Board of Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, the Board of Trustees declared a special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share. Both dividends were paid on January 15, 2019 to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2018. 
On March 5, 2019, the Board of Trustees declared a special cash dividend of $0.33 per common share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019. The dividend will be paid on April 15, 2019 to holders of record as of March 29, 2019. 
LEASING
We typically enter into master leases, leases with contractual rent escalators and leases that require ongoing tenant financial reporting. Most of our leases contain rent escalators, or provisions that periodically increase the base rent payable by the tenant under the lease. Although 34.7% of our rent escalators increase rent at a fixed amount on fixed dates, as of December 31, 2018, approximately 59.6% (41.5% excluding Shopko) (excluding leases on multi-tenant properties) of our rent escalators increase rent by a multiple of any increases in the CPI or the lesser of (a) a multiple of any increase in the CPI over a specified period or (b) a fixed percentage. 
Many of our tenants are required to provide financial information, which includes balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement data, on a quarterly and/or annual basis, and, as of December 31, 2018, approximately 76.2% (58.3% excluding Shopko) of our lease investment portfolio requires the tenant to provide property-level performance information, which includes income statement data on a quarterly and/or annual basis. To assist in our determination of a tenant’s credit quality, we license a product from Moody’s Analytics that provides an EDF and a “shadow rating,” and we evaluate a lease’s property-level rent coverage ratio. An EDF is only an estimate of default probability based, in part, on assumptions incorporated into the product. A shadow rating does not constitute a published credit rating and lacks the extensive company participation that is typically involved when a rating agency publishes a rating; accordingly, a shadow rating may not be as indicative of creditworthiness as a rating published by Moody’s, S&P, or another nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Our calculations of EDFs, shadow ratings and rent coverage ratios are based on financial information provided to us by our tenants and prospective tenants without independent verification on our part, and we must assume the appropriateness of estimates and judgments that were made by the party preparing the financial information. See Item 2. “Properties."
OUR MANAGER 
We and our Manager are parties to the Asset Management Agreement, pursuant to which our Manager provides a management team that is responsible for implementing our business strategy and performing certain services for us, subject to oversight by our Board of Trustees. We do not have any employees. Our officers and the other individuals who execute our business strategy are employees of our Manager or its affiliates. Our Manager’s duties, subject to the supervision of our Board of Trustees, include: (1) performing all of our day-to-day functions, (2) sourcing, analyzing and executing on investments and dispositions, (3) determining investment criteria, (4) performing liability management duties, including financing and hedging, and (5) performing financial and accounting management. For its services, our Manager is entitled to an annual management fee and incentive compensation, as well as a termination fee and a promoted interest under certain circumstances. This description of our Asset Management Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Asset Management Agreement, which has been included as an exhibit to this Annual Report. 
COMPETITION
As a landlord, we compete in the multi-billion dollar commercial real estate market with numerous developers and owners of properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. In operating and managing our portfolio, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors, including location, rental rates and flexibility. Some of our competitors have greater economies of scale, have lower cost of capital, have access to more resources and have greater name recognition than we do. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose our tenants or prospective tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates or to offer substantial rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our leases expire.

REGULATION
General
Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals.
Americans With Disabilities Act 
Pursuant to the ADA, our properties are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA, as well as a number of additional federal, state and local laws and regulations, may require modifications to properties we currently own and any properties we purchase, or may restrict renovations of those properties. Noncompliance with these laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants, as well as the incurrence of the costs of making modifications to attain compliance, and future legislation could impose additional financial obligations or restrictions on our properties. Although our tenants are generally responsible for all maintenance and repair costs pursuant to triple-net leases, including compliance with the ADA and other similar laws or regulations, we could be held liable as the owner of the property for a failure of one of our tenants to comply with such laws or regulations.
Environmental Matters
Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regulate, and impose liability for, releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under various of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances, hazardous wastes or petroleum product releases or threats of releases at the property, and may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred by those parties in connection with actual or threatened contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to fault, or whether or not the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the presence of the contamination. The liability under these laws may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and severally liable may seek contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties for their fair share toward these costs. These costs may be substantial, and can exceed the value of the property. The presence of contamination, or the failure to properly remediate contamination, on a property may adversely affect the ability of the owner, operator or tenant to sell or rent that property or to borrow using the property as collateral and may adversely impact our investment in that property.
Some of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Similarly, some of our properties are or were used for commercial or industrial purposes that involve or involved the use of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or are adjacent to or near properties that have been or are used for similar commercial or industrial purposes. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, and we could potentially be required to pay to clean up any contamination. In addition, strict environmental laws regulate a variety of activities that can occur on a property, including the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, air emissions and water discharges. Such laws may impose fines or penalties for violations. As a result of the foregoing, we could be materially and adversely affected.
Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of ACM. Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management to identify and warn, through signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed ACM in their building. The regulations also have employee training, record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to ACM. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. As a result of these regulations, building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to ACM. The regulations may affect the value of a building containing ACM in which we have invested. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of ACM when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release into the environment of ACM and may provide for fines to owners or operators of real properties. In addition, owners or operators of real properties can be exposed to third-party liability for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with ACM.

When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. We are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our properties that have not been previously addressed or remediated by us.
Before completing any property acquisition, we obtain environmental assessments in order to identify potential environmental concerns at the property. These assessments are carried out in accordance with the Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments (ASTM Practice E 1527-13) as set by ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials, and generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historical aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property. These assessments are limited in scope; however, if recommended in the initial assessments, we may undertake additional assessments such as soil and/or groundwater sampling or other limited subsurface investigations and ACM or mold surveys to test for substances of concern. A prior owner or operator of a property or historic operations at our properties may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the site assessments. Material environmental conditions may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. If environmental concerns are not satisfactorily resolved in any initial or additional assessments, we may obtain environment insurance policies to insure against potential environmental risk or loss depending on the type of property, the availability and cost of the insurance and various other factors we deem relevant (e.g., an environmental occurrence affects one of our properties where our lessee may not have the financial capability to honor its indemnification obligations to us).
Generally, our leases provide that the lessee will indemnify us for any loss or expense we incur as a result of the presence, use or release of hazardous materials on our property. However, our ultimate liability for environmental conditions may exceed the policy limits on any environmental insurance policies we obtain, if any. If we are unable to enforce the indemnification obligations of our lessees or if the amount of environmental insurance we carry is inadequate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.
INSURANCE
Our tenants are generally required to maintain liability and property insurance coverage for the properties they lease from us pursuant to triple-net leases. Under such leases, our tenants are generally required to name us (and any of our lenders that have a mortgage on the property leased by the tenant) as additional insureds on their liability policies and additional insured and/or loss payee (or mortgagee, in the case of our lenders) on their property policies. Tenants are required to maintain casualty coverage and most carry limits at 100% of replacement cost. Depending on the location of the property, losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by earthquakes and floods, may be covered by insurance policies that are held by our tenant with limitations such as large deductibles or co-payments that a tenant may not be able to meet. In addition, losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by wind/hail, hurricanes, terrorism or acts of war, may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. In the event there is damage to our properties that is not covered by insurance and such properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we will continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties are irreparably damaged. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Properties - Insurance on our properties may not adequately cover all losses, which could materially and adversely affect us.”
In addition to being generally named as additional insureds on our tenants’ liability policies, we separately maintain commercial general liability coverage with limits of $1.0 million for each occurrence and $2.0 million general aggregate. We also maintain primary property coverage on (i) all unleased properties, (ii) all properties for which such coverage is not required to be carried by a tenant and (iii) all properties for which we obtain such coverage but the costs of which are reimbursed by tenants. In addition, we maintain excess property coverage on all remaining properties and other property coverage as may be required by our lenders.
