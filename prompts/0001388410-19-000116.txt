CORPORATE HISTORY
 
Formation and Development
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 6, 2005. On November 1, 2012, the Company, formerly Endeavor Power Corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Endeavor Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Parallax Diagnostics, Inc., a Nevada corporation, whereby Parallax Diagnostics became a wholly-owned subsidiary. On January 9, 2014, the Company changed its name to Parallax Health Sciences, Inc. 
 
The Parallax business was founded on the Company’s Point-of-Care diagnostic business, Parallax Diagnostics, Inc., in 2010, when the Company acquired the right, title, and interest, through an exclusive license with Montecito BioSciences, Ltd. (“MBS”), to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Target System, an FDA-cleared 
2 desktop point-of-care immunoassay diagnostic testing system. Concurrently, through an Assignment Agreement with MBS, the Company acquired the right, title, and interest to twenty-five (25) FDA-cleared 2 tests in the area of infectious disease, medical conditions, drugs of abuse, cardiac and pregnancy, that are designed to be utilized with the Target System.

On August 31, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Qolpom®, Inc., an Arizona corporation in the remote healthcare monitoring and telehealth business (“Qolpom®”) and its shareholders (the “Seller”) to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Qolpom®’s common stock and its assets, inventory and intellectual property. The agreement was fully executed and the transaction was completed on September 20, 2016. The consideration for the acquisition resulted in a fair market value of $290,000, and goodwill of $785,060. In addition, the agreement included contingent royalties and revenue sharing for future revenues generated from the Qolpom® technology. The Qolpom® name was later changed to Parallax Health Management, Inc. (“PHM”).

On March 22, 2017, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Parallax Behavioral Health, Inc. (“PBH”), a Delaware corporation, and on April 26, 2017, completed the asset acquisition of 100% of certain intellectual property (“Intellectual Property”) from ProEventa Inc., a Virginia Corporation (“ProEventa”), in accordance with the Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement between the Company, PBH and ProEventa (the “ProEventa Agreement”). ProEventa has an expertise in the development of behavioral health technologies, and is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Grafton Integrated Health Network, Inc., a non-profit Virginia corporation (“Grafton”). Pursuant to the ProEventa Agreement, the initial consideration for the Intellectual Property was paid to ProEventa in the form of a stock purchase agreement to purchase 2,500,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock for $2,500, resulting in a net cost for the Intellectual Property of $622,500. In addition, the Agreement included conditional contingent royalties and revenue sharing for future revenues generated from the Intellectual Property.

On September 20, 2018, the Company formed Parallax Communications, Inc, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parallax Health Management, Inc.
 
Changes in Management
 
On April 6, 2017, the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) elected Mr. J. Michael Redmond as Chairman, to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders, in accordance with the Company’s bylaws, and/or until his successor is duly appointed, or a resignation is duly tendered.
 
Effective July 6, 2017, the Board caused the departure of Mr. Redmond from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and RoxSan Pharmacy, Inc. 
 
Effective July 7, 2017, pursuant to a unanimous Board resolution, Mr. Paul R. Arena was appointed as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and the Board caused Mr. Arena's election to the Board and the Boards of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Parallax Health Management, Inc. and Parallax Behavioral Health, Inc.
 
On July 26, 2017, Mr. Jorn Gorlach resigned as a member of the Board. This resignation did not involve any disagreements with the Company.
 
On June 4, 2018, Mr. Anand Kumar resigned as a member of the Board. This resignation did not involve any disagreement with the Company. Mr. Nathaniel T. Bradley, currently serving as Chief Technology Officer, succeeded him, and agreed to serve as a member of the Board until the next annual meeting of the shareholders and/or until his successor is duly appointed.
 
RoxSan Pharmacy
 
In 2013, the Company identified an opportunity to acquire RoxSan Pharmacy, Inc. (“RoxSan”), a California corporation, and began the due diligence process. The Company’s initial interest centered on utilizing the acquisition as a means of accelerating the commercialization of the Company’s Target System and diagnostic platform, as RoxSan had access to a nationwide network of doctors and sales representatives. During the due diligence process, the Company became aware of numerous opportunities that RoxSan and its markets represented.
 
On March 21, 2013, the Company entered into a Letter of Intent with Shahla Melamed, RoxSan's sole Shareholder, to acquire RoxSan. Between 2013 and 2015, four (4) amendments were also executed.
 
As part of the acquisition, the Company was required to obtain licensure from the State of California, and on July 31, 2015, the Company received notice that its pharmacy and sterile compounding licenses were issued by the California State Board of Pharmacy. 
 
On August 13, 2015, (the “Closing Date”), pursuant to a resolution of the Board, the Company entered into an Agreement to Purchase and Sell One Hundred Percent of the Issued and Outstanding Shares of RoxSan Pharmacy, Inc. (“RoxSan” or the “Pharmacy”), and its Assets and Inventory (the “Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement between Parallax, RoxSan and its sole shareholder, Shahla Melamed (the “Seller” or “Melamed” or “Former Owner”), in exchange for 100% of RoxSan's common stock, and its assets and inventory, Parallax, among other things, issued the Seller a Secured Promissory Note (the “Note”) dated August 13, 2015, in the amount of $20.5 million (the “Acquisition”). The Note bore interest at a rate of 6% per annum, and matured August 13, 2018 (“Maturity”). the Company is seeking a reduction in the Purchase Price and related promissory note (See ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS section). As a result of the Acquisition, effective August 13, 2015, RoxSan became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parallax. No change in control occurred as a result of the Acquisition.

- 2 -


In connection with the Acquisition, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement (the “Employment Agreement”) with the Seller. Under the Employment Agreement, Melamed agreed to provide exclusive consulting services to RoxSan in the areas of public relations and marketing for a term of four (4) years. On March 4, 2016, the Company terminated the Employment Agreement in accordance with paragraph 3.2 Termination for Cause. The termination was the result of, among other things, Melamed's breaches in the Agreement, which were substantiated by an investigation conducted by an employment law firm retained by RoxSan. Under the terms of the Agreement, no financial obligation resulted in the termination. 
 
Since Parallax’s acquisition of RoxSan, the deleterious actions against the pharmacy by the Former Owner, including, among other things, interference with management and operations, and attempts to damage and/or divert customer and vendor relationships, had a significant adverse impact on the pharmacy. Furthermore, the discovery of the Former Owner’s alleged involvement in suspected insurance fraud caused RoxSan’s contract with its primary IVF drug rebate program to be terminated in August 2016. As a result, RoxSan was no longer eligible to receive incentive rebates for the majority of its IVF drug purchases, which were key to the profitability of the IVF drug sales; and for which without the rebates, RoxSan was unable to provide its customers with competitively priced IVF drugs. This, among other things, caused a precipitous drop in RoxSan’s IVF revenues, and ultimate exit from the IVF market in mid-2017. Soon thereafter, in July 2017, RoxSan’s contract with its primary drug supplier was terminated for similar reasons connected to the Former Owner and alleged criminal activities associated with the Melamed family name, despite Parallax’s new ownership and management. After careful consideration, the Company determined that RoxSan was unable to generate enough profits to sustain its pharmacy business, and in December 2017, the pharmacy ceased operations and closed the business location in Beverly Hills, CA; some residual operations were still ongoing during 2018 to wind down the business. 

On May 14, 2018, pursuant to unanimous resolutions of the boards of directors of RoxSan Pharmacy, Inc. and Parallax Health Sciences, Inc., RoxSan filed a Chapter 7 petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California (the “Court”). Mr. Timothy Yoo was appointed trustee (“Trustee”) on May 15, 2018. In connection with this filing, RoxSan sought to discharge approximately $5 million of liabilities owed to various parties, and intercompany loans in excess of $1 million owed to Parallax. The Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding by RoxSan Pharmacy, Inc. was fully discharged and the case was closed on March 13, 2019, in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California.
 
Due to, among other things, the reduction in RoxSan’s cash flows during 2016 and 2017, RoxSan became delinquent in its payroll tax depository obligations, resulting in a liability owed to federal and state taxing agencies in the aggregate of $1,148,811, which includes $601,148 in taxes withheld from employees (“Trust Fund Taxes”), employer taxes of $183,172, and penalties and interest of $364,491 through December 31, 2018. The liability was included as part of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, and certain portions of the liability may be discharged. However, in accordance with California bankruptcy laws, federal and state Trust Fund Taxes are not dischargeable. The Company has retained a tax resolution specialist and is in communications with the taxing agencies in order to resolve RoxSan’s liability. 
 
As a result of the loss of financial control of RoxSan, the Company derecognized the subsidiary as of September 30, 2018. The derecognition resulted in a gain of $4,478,268. The Company also extinguished $22,778,281 in debt and accrued interest related to the acquisition of RoxSan.

Parallax Care™
 
The Company envisions a world where healthcare is accessible, reliable and affordable, without compromising quality and economics of the healthcare industry. Driven by a sincere desire to make people’s lives better and push back on the healthcare industry’s crippling economic outlook, the Parallax Care™ platform was created; the Company’s design is for “outcomes realized through intelligent health.”
 
The Parallax Care™ system facilitates cost-effective remote diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients with chronic diseases. Parallax’s integrated products and services provide Point-of-Care (“POC”) patient testing and monitoring, along with information communicated via cloud-based mobile smartphone applications that are agnostic as to operating systems and utilize sophisticated data analytics. Information is retrieved in real-time by physicians and other healthcare professionals and is integrated into electronic health records. The Company’s digital products and services capitalize on the transformation of healthcare to provide improved compliance, diagnosis, monitoring and support to patients, along with cost savings and efficiencies to healthcare systems.
Parallax Care™ encompasses three separate divisions that can operate independently of one another, or integrate services to meet the various needs of the Company’s clientele: Optimized Outcomes, Connected Health and Smart Data.

Optimized Outcomes | REBOOT™ / COMPASS™ Behavioral modification 
-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Connected Health | Fotodigm® platform Remote patient monitoring, telehealth, and POC diagnostic testing
Smart Data | Intrinsic Code™ technology Actionable insights to behavior modification 

 
Each of the Company’s divisions target a separate vertical market that complement each other and the Company value proposition. In addition, the synergistic operational cross-over affords the Company the ability to use built-in economies of scale across multiple operating platforms.
 
The Company believes that the solutions lay in the empowerment of the patient, the payer and the provider; creating a model of healthcare that aligns all three interests and creates a singular goal of better health outcomes, at reduced cost. The Parallax Care™ platform involves these areas of focus:
 
•
Behavioral Modification

The Company believes in working to empower the patient to modify their behavior through personal empowerment. The Company has developed and designed a revolutionary technology that will aid in the challenges of behavior modification, and improve adherence to medical regimens, which can lead to lower costs and better health. 
 
REBOOT™, the Company’s patented cloud-based behavioral software technology, along with COMPASS™, the Company’s mobile application that incorporates REBOOT™ with unique mobile phone features, and WIZARD™, which supports scalability of the REBOOT™/COMPASS™ platform, was developed by behavioral specialists at Grafton Integrated Health Network, a multistate behavioral healthcare organization with over 60 years of clinical experience and data in behavioral health.
 
•
Connected Health

Continually increasing healthcare costs, difficulty accessing care, and a greater need for convenience, are driving consumers to demand more value out of their healthcare dollar and seek care that meets their needs and preferences. The market is responding to this growing demand, and non-traditional care models are rapidly expanding, such as:
 •
Traditional providers (e.g., office-based primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists, hospitals) are partnering with non-traditional care providers to expand reach. 
 •
New parties, such as consumer product and technology companies, are entering this billion-dollar market. 
 •
Non-traditional care models have the opportunity to complement traditional care models to help improve access and affordability, and to deliver a more personalized healthcare experience. 
 
To meet these changing demands, the Company has developed Fotodigm®, the Company’s proprietary connected health platform that provides remote patient monitoring, telehealth, POC diagnostics and health education products and services on a single platform. Currently in its beta stage, Fotodigm® has the capability for systems integration of an unlimited number of third-party services and solutions. The Company is continuing the Fotodigm® beta stage to test economic models and delivery modalities in preparation for large-scale deployment of the Fotodigm® platform. The Fotodigm® platform is based on the following:

 •
Allows doctors to earn additional revenue that they cannot participate in with outside labs and testing not performed in their offices. 
 •
Patients can test from their homes and transmit data to doctors. 
 
The Parallax Business Model
 
In the past 60 years, healthcare has transitioned from a direct relationship between doctor and patient, to one that has patients separated from their doctors by the introduction of a huge number of stakeholders, ranging from health insurers, employers, pharmacy benefit managers, imaging, diagnostic testing, lawyers, specialists and a plethora of others. The patient and healthcare provider both want the same thing: information, quality of service, transparency, value for their hard-earned dollars, and more time in their day.
 
The Company has developed, acquired and licensed multiple proprietary and exclusive platforms that provide services and products, across the healthcare continuum. These platforms are designed to allow for multiple points of reciprocal consideration, through innovative business models, that provide patients with increased quality of services and products, at reduced cost of time and money. They also provide healthcare providers with increased access to their patients, the ability to deliver better and more efficient service and increase their income from the services they supply. The Company believes the Parallax Care™ system will deliver solutions to problems of health and economics, while providing essential actionable data to pharmaceutical firms, payers and healthcare providers, through our:
 
•
Patented behavioral machine learning technology; 
 •
Patented POC diagnostic testing technology; 
 •
Patent-pending interoperable connected health platform targeting two of healthcare’s biggest problems that, combined, address markets that represent over $1 trillion in costs 
3: 
 •
Medical nonadherence 
 •
Chronic disease management; and 
 •
Smart Data delivered through enhanced patient/disease stratification, in combination with dynamic behavioral data, relating to adherence to pharmacologic and medical therapy regimens designed to: 
 •
help patient outcomes 
 •
reduce the cost of care associated with nonadherence 
 •
deliver actionable data. 
 
Cognitive AI
 
The Company is working with partners that have developed a cognitive artificial intelligence, (“Cognitive AI”) agent architecture with the interaction of emotion, motivation and cognition of situated agents, mainly based on the Psi theory of Dietrich Dörner. The Psi theory addresses emotion, perception, representation and bounded rationality, but being formulated within psychology, has had relatively little impact on the discussion of agents within computer science. Cognitive AI is a formulation of the original theory in a more abstract and formal way, at the same time enhancing it with additional concepts for memory, building of ontological categories and attention.

Big Data Opportunity
 
The Company’s real-time data generated from patient-users can be stripped to protect the specific patient-user identity and exchanged for historical data with Center for Disease Control, (“CDC”), National Institute of Health, (“NIH”), various universities and others to provide valuable empirical health related information to the Company’s patient-users using Cognitive AI provided by the Company’s partners and coordinated through various electronic health record organizations for which the Company is agnostic. This empirical data when it becomes available on the Company’s outcomes optimization based platform will become a valuable tool for determining predictive and supportive diagnostics to its patient-users.
 
The Company’s endeavors to change the healthcare industry are strengthened by providing solutions to real problems facing healthcare stakeholders today. The Company’s products and services have been developed, and are continuing to be developed, to address these issues now. The Company’s models include revenue from, and are compatible with, both the traditional reimbursement through payers, and the new performance-based compensation and financial incentive for the adoption of healthy, preventative behavior.
 
The Cross-Over and Cross-Pollination Model 
 
The Company’s business model is built on identifying opportunities represented by one market vertical that provides for a separate vertical to utilize one or more of the Company’s core operations. Although the multiple operations of Parallax Care™ are focused in separate vertical markets, the Company has designed its business model to allow for cross-pollination and reciprocal transfer of value at multiple points in their respective economic food chains. 
 
As an example of how each of the Company’s divisions can support each other utilizing the cross-over and cross-pollination model:
 
•
The Optimized Outcomes division can provide a range of after-care products and services through the Connected Health division. 
 •
The Connected Health division can offer telehealth and remote patient monitoring, and POC testing and diagnostics services directly to the doctors and patients of the Optimized Outcomes division. Further, remote patent monitoring customers can be offered POC testing and diagnostics, and vice versa. 
 •
The Smart Data division can offer the Company’s software and Intrinsic Code™ technology systems to the Optimized Outcomes and/or Connected Health clientele. 
 
The term cross-over and cross-pollination is best demonstrated by the manner in which Parallax customers are exposed to products and services they might benefit from other than what they are seeking, and these additional products and services could augment the core product or service they receive from Parallax. The cross-over component comes from the customer, their unique situation and perspective (including socio-economic, demographic and stratified health profile), and their participation in innovation through their individual goals as it relates to their health regimen; the cross-pollination comes through the value represented by the exposure to Parallax’s product and technology offerings. By way of the cross-over and cross-pollination model, the customer is empowered and increases participation in their own health, which is one of Parallax’s core strategies. 
 
An example of the cross-over and cross-pollination model is further illustrated as follows:
 
A customer has identified Parallax Care as a solution for Remote Monitoring of their health or medical condition (i.e. a chronic disease); 
 
The customer will be prescribed a medical regimen that includes prescription medication and biometric vitals (i.e. blood pressure, weight, glucose, et al); 
 
The opportunity is created for Parallax to introduce its Medication Adherence product to the customer. 
 
The customer type will vary, depending upon the sales and marketing approach and target audience, but is primarily comprised of:
 
Patients 
 
Providers: Doctors, Nurses, Clinicians and Caregivers 
 
Payers: Insurance Companies, Corporations, Government 
 
The Company believes that the current healthcare system is built on unsustainable models and significant challenges for all the stakeholders in the healthcare system. The Company also believes that it can deliver solutions which fill a void in the current market for high quality, high efficacy products and services delivered at reasonable and rational prices. The Company’s business strategy is to expand through organic growth, selective synergistic acquisition, and develop, license and/or acquire, quality products and or services that complement the Parallax Care™ systems.

Products and Services
 
Parallax believes that its products and services can provide solutions that mitigate rising costs, reduce waste in spending through transparency, reduce the amount of unnecessary services, and increase the health and wellness of patients before they are sick. 
 
Remote healthcare products include patented and patent pending software and mobile apps (to be available for iPhone on Apple App Play Store and Android on Google Play) and other services, as well as electronic kits and devices from third-party licensed platforms that are designated towards a patient’s primary health concern (i.e. diabetes, blood pressure, cardiovascular, general monitoring, etc.), and offer both audio and video options that interface with the patient’s healthcare providers. Prescription medication dosage monitoring is also available. 
 
Behavioral health products include the proprietary behavioral health technology, REBOOT™, which powers decision support that can also be delivered securely to any internet connected device. The software can be used by an individual or an organization of any size, with the potential to transform the cost of treating and managing chronic illnesses such as pulmonary-COPD-asthma, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease by effecting the modification of behavior in patients being treated for these chronic diseases.
 
Diagnostics products include the Target System, the Company’s proprietary POC diagnostic immunoassay testing platform and test cartridges for the areas of infectious diseases, cardiac markers, drugs of abuse and various other medical conditions, and the patented SPARKS Mobile™, the next-generation handheld mobile analyzer currently under development. The Target System will allow doctors to test patients in their office, with test results delivered in 10 minutes or less. This allows patients to be provided with important information at the time of testing. The costs of the Target System are less than outside lab-based tests, benefiting both payers and patients. In addition, doctors will be able to generate additional revenue that would normally be paid to an outside laboratory, and patients can even perform test from their homes, with results transmitted directly to their doctor.
 
Through the development and design of the Fotodigm® platform, the Company’s telehealth, RPM and POC products and services are interoperable and interchangeable with any FDA cleared/approved medical device, providing ease of use and connectivity between patient and doctor. The advancement in the Company’s technology is strengthened by the ability to scale its products to meet the demands of both individuals and large groups alike. 
 
Targeted Problems
 
Medication Nonadherence
 
Medication nonadherence is a priority public health consideration, affecting health outcomes and overall healthcare costs on a worldwide basis. Increasing adherence to medical regimens leads to better health outcomes in chronic disease and reduces the overall costs to the patient, payer and all of the stakeholders across the healthcare continuum.
 
Nonadherence to medication regimen in chronic disease management is the cause of 
4:
 
•
$300 billion in avoidable costs to the U.S. healthcare system annually; 
 •
125,000 premature deaths in the U.S. annually. 
 
Research from the World Health Organization 
5 has shown that better adherence to antihypertensive treatment could prevent 89,000 deaths each year in the U.S., with a projected savings of $106 billion a year.
 
Chronic Disease Management
 
Chronic diseases are on the rise in the U.S., leaving healthcare payers with the challenge of covering care for patients with these expensive, long-term conditions. Healthcare spending reached a total of $3.2 trillion in 2015, based upon estimates from the Center for Medicare Services (“CMS”). Spending is expected to grow at an average of 5.5% through 2025, with chronic disease treatment comprising a major portion of that spending.
 
Based on the latest data from the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”), the top 8 most expensive chronic diseases for healthcare payers to treat are:
 
•
Cardiovascular Disease
Cardiovascular disease (“CVD”) in the U.S. total $317 billion per year, split between $193.7 billion in direct medical costs and $123.5 billion in lost productivity. An adult in the U.S dies from CVD related health conditions every 40 seconds, with CVD deaths accounting for 31% of all U.S. deaths each year.
 
•
Smoking-Related Health Issues
The estimated costs for smoking-related health issues in the U.S. total over $300 billion per year, split between direct healthcare expenses of $170 billion and indirect costs of roughly $156 billion.

•
Alcohol-Related Health Issues
In 2010, excessive alcohol use cost the U.S. economy $249 billion, or roughly $2.05 per drink. Alcohol-related deaths totaled 88,000 people per year, and shortened the lives of working adults by an average of 30 years.
 
•
Diabetes
As one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in healthcare, diabetes care costs reached $245 billion in 2016. Seventy-one percent of diabetes treatment costs ($176 billion) were related to direct healthcare expenses. That equates to 20 percent of U.S. healthcare spending.
 
•
Cancer
According to the latest estimates from the CDC and the National Cancer Institute, cancer care costs are roughly $171 billion a year due to healthcare inflation over previous decades.
 
•
Obesity
The United States spends $147 billion on healthcare related to obesity, and roughly $117 billion on costs related to inadequate physical activity. In 2006, healthcare costs for obese patients were $1,429 higher than patients at a normal weight. Obesity is implicated in the development or worsening of many other chronic conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
 
•
Arthritis
The total cost of arthritis in the U.S. was an estimated $128 billion, split between $81 billion in direct medical expenses and $47 billion in related losses of productivity and care management. Arthritis affects 23 percent of adults in the U.S., or 54 million people, and is expected to rise to 78 million cases by 2040. Arthritis also occurs with other chronic conditions, as many patients are unsure on how to manage their own symptoms.
 
•
Strokes
On its own, strokes in the U.S. create medical expenses of $33 billion annually and accounts for 1 out of 20 deaths in the country, or an estimated 130,000 deaths per year.
 
These nonadherence and chronic disease numbers are daunting in the best of conditions, but the reality is that the sheer volume of U.S. citizens reaching the age of 60 will impact the cost trajectory. The projected financial impact is not sustainable under the current healthcare system.

TARGET SYSTEM and DIAGNOSTIC TESTING PLATFORM
---------------------------------------------

Overview 
 
Parallax continues its focus on Point-of-Care diagnostics, with an emphasis on its Target System testing platform, including the FDA-cleared VT-1000 desktop analyzer and novel applications that detect and/or monitor infectious diseases, cardiac markers and drug of abuse assays. The Company holds exclusive licenses, in perpetuity, to a line of proprietary, patented and/or patent-pending, FDA-cleared, Point-of-Care diagnostic tests to be utilized with its single platform diagnostic testing Target System. Parallax, with its products and products in development, offers the potential to transform the diagnostic landscape by transitioning critical tests from the centralized lab directly to the hands of the physician or clinicians. 
 
The Company continues to pursue viable opportunities for the commercialization of its product, including strategic partnerships with third-party companies in order to limit the Company’s capital outlay. Additionally, the Company has sought to identify strategies that would make its proposition more valuable and competitive. The Company has made the strategic decision to keep the POC diagnostics product line off the market, and has spent the last few years prosecuting its patents and further developing potential integration of new applications. The Company has been issued patents on core technology of its technology for its Target System. In 2014, 2015 and 2017, the Company and its license partner, Montecito BioSciences, Ltd. (“MBS”), received patents on its mobile testing platform in conjunction with its Target System cartridges in the United States, China, Hong Kong, Macao, and India. To this end, the Company has pursued patents around its foundational technology and the SPARKS Mobile™ diagnostic reader. The Company also has a technology that was 
previously cleared by the FDA technology that is being used as a platform for a test that will detect CD4 and CD8 cells which in turn determine a patient’s immune status.

Target System Product Strategy 
 
In recent years, there has been a continuing shift from the use of laboratory-based analyzers to point-of-care (“POC”) tests that can be performed in a matter of minutes. Unlike the centralized clinical laboratory segment of the diagnostic market, which is mature and highly competitive, the POC market is still in its relatively early stages. According to the recent worldwide research reports, however, such as the 2010 Worldwide IVD Market, by the research firm Kalorama Information, the growth rate of the POC market continues to rise. Although certain simple, single analyte diagnostic tests have been developed, such tests have remained incapable of precise and highly sensitive quantitative measurements. As a result, medical tests that require precise quantitation of the target analyte have remained the domain of immunoassay analyzers in the centralized laboratory.
 
Point-of-Care diagnostic kits typically consist of test strips that the healthcare provider applies a patient’s sample to and then reads the strip either visually or with an instrument in order to determine a result. They are simple to use, fast, disposable and reliable within an acceptable range. More sensitive analytes or tests requiring quantitative analysis and definitive antibody screening needed in most situations, must be sent out to a diagnostic lab, and hours or days later results arrive. These tests are comparatively complex, expensive, and time consuming; only centralized diagnostic facilities can manage sample handling and the cost of instruments and reagents. A POC instrument that has the advantage of a test strip device in terms of ease of use and rapid results along with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-like capabilities for major diseases would circumscribe diagnosis routinely within the course of a patient visit. This could disrupt the current model. The Company is planning to develop just such a device that it intends to sell to doctors and healthcare providers.

The commercial success of the current generation of small, simple to use diagnostic devices which provide rapid results in POC applications has been limited by their inability to provide precise, highly sensitive, quantitative measurement. Despite these limitations, the rapid increase in discovery of individual markers of disease processes, coupled with the advancements in rapid detection technologies, has made these tools available to medical professionals on a wide scale and POC diagnostics are quickly becoming a high growth industry.
 
The Target System (the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer, the Target Antigen Detection Cartridge and associated reagents) technology addresses these limitations by applying sophisticated immunochemical and optical methods to detect and quantify analytes present in various human specimens, including blood, urine, and feces. Data indicates that sensitivity will be comparable to expensive and complicated laboratory-based analyzers. The Company believes that there is market potential for advanced POC diagnostic products that provide quick and accurate diagnosis during a patient visit, shortening the decision time to medical intervention and minimizing the need for additional patient follow-up, thereby reducing overall healthcare delivery costs.
 
The Company also believes that there is growth opportunity for the exploitation of its Target System platform in developing nations and regions such as Africa, India, South America, Eastern Europe, Russia and Asia as well as developed markets of North America and Western Europe. One of the first initiatives to be developed for this market will combine the Company’s SPARKS Mobile™ (a portable hand-held diagnostic analyzer based on the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer), currently in development, with a test for the monitoring of AIDS/TB patients through the use of a proprietary rapid point-of-care immunoassay CD4-CD8 test called PROMISE CD4, also in development.
 
The Diagnostics Products
 
The Company’s assets include a FDA-cleared VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer and more than two dozen FDA 510(k) cleared diagnostic tests. The Desktop Analyzer and immunoassay system incorporates a flow-through rapid antigen test platform configuration that has the ability to produce high-performance quantitative blood test results with the ease of rapid qualitative diagnostic strips. The Company has patents and patent applications related to its current and future products, as well as methods for future test development. The Target VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer is ideally suited for rapid development and commercialization of all new tests that may be introduced, as well as integrating remote patient monitoring and telehealth products and services into the Target System through the SPARKS Mobile™ platform.
VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer: Quantitative and Qualitative Immunoassay
 
The Company’sVT-1000 Desktop Analyzer is FDA-cleared and is capable of rapidly detecting qualitative and quantitative data for its FDA-cleared Target Platform tests. The VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer is used for all Target Platform Tests, allowing for clinical personnel to be trained once and also gives consistent results for both qualitative and quantitative testing. The Company plans to develop the SPARKS Mobile, a hand-held analyzer unit, similar in size to a mobile phone/PDA, which will be based on the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer (see “SPARKS Mobile™: The Target System Hand-Held Analyzer).

VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer
 

Target Antigen Detection System (“TADS”)
 
The Target Antigen Detection System consists of a unique single-use cartridge with reagents capable of testing multiple test markers for qualitative testing and, when used with the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer, provides quantitative results. The TADS requires a small amount of sample and provides results in minutes. The simplicity of the fully loaded single-use test cartridge and subsequent ease-of-use of the instrument helps to alleviate the technical burden on medical staff and makes patient diagnosis more efficient.
 
Each individual TADS test cartridge operates in a uniform fashion using a controlled flow-through rapid antigen testing system, utilizing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (“ELISA”). The ELISA method is a technique used to determine if a certain substance is present within a sample. Using special antibodies that attach to the substance, the sample will generate a specific color. The amount of color indicates the amount of substance present. Another set of antibodies are used to “capture” the substance.
6 The results can then be measured at specific wavelengths by an ELISA analyzer, such as the VT-1000, in two forms:
 

Qualitative: Refers to whether an analyte is present, and provides “positive” or “negative” results through color changes, using known positive and negative samples. 
 

Quantitative: Refers to how much is present, and uses a series of standards to measure the unknown amount of analyte.

The Company’s Target Antigen Detection System is a departure from the standard devices typical to the rapid testing markets and can allow for physicians to share in revenues. The device is part of the manufacturer’s qualitative and quantitative “Target System Diagnostics Platform,” which offers an array of improved modifications and features to the traditional qualitative and semi-quantitative flow-through immunoassay test. With its platform uniformity, vacuum pump, absorption layer for sample overflow, and complete compatibility with single and multi-light source reflectometer technology, the TADS cartridge is a unique collection of tests for qualitative and quantitative detection diseases and of conditions. The TADS cartridge utilizes a vacuum technology to deposit specimen samples uniformly on test membranes. The Vacuum Control Flow Device provides a vacuum pump action, which reduces test time and ensures maximum contact with the membrane antibodies. This collection device allows for numerous tests to be incorporated. The vacuum specimen filtration and excess specimen absorption is built right in.


   TADS Components
 

TADS 2.0 Flow Through Testing System with Pressure Indicator
 
On March 3, 2017, the Company, through its licensor, Montecito BioSciences, Inc., was granted patent 9,588,114 (See “Intellectual Property Summary”) for the new and improved TADS testing cartridge, which provides an assay device that has an externally manipulatable piston for creating a region of reduced air pressure beneath a membrane containing an analytic compound, preferably a receptor or antibody. The region of reduced pressure causes a fluid sample to be tested to be rapidly drawn through the membrane. To ensure that a sufficient reduction in pressure is achieved, the membrane further includes a pressure sensing means, so the entire sample contacts the analytic compound. The Company believes that obtaining the greatest level of contact where the antibody and antigen meet, is essential when striving for the best possible test results to be consistently achieved.
How the Target Antigen Detection System (“TADS”) Works
 
The TADS testing system performs immunoassays on analytes for determining the presence and/or amount of an analyte in a sample, and includes:
 

An immunosorbent membrane; 
 
An absorbent material; 
 
A piston component located below the absorbent material to draw analytes in a sample through the immunosorbent membrane into the absorbent material; and 
 
Discrete groups of pressure-sensitive microcapsules located on the immunosorbent membrane. 
 
Each group of microcapsules has a different predetermined average burst strength; and 
 
Each group of microcapsules includes a dye that is different from the dye of any other of said groups. 

- 11 -


The TADS testing system has an immunosorbent membrane with one or more binding agents non-diffusively bound to its upper surface. The immunosorbent membrane refers to a porous support membrane having at least one antibody (polyclonal or monoclonal antibody), antibody fragment or derivative thereof, aptamer, or other non-protein based entity (e.g., a carbohydrate or lipid), which specifically binds to a cognate epitope. In particular, the porous material is a thin disk of material such as nitrocellulose, nylon (e.g., cast from nylon 6,6 polymer) or polyvinylidene difluoride (PDVF).
 

A sample or analyte solution refers to any sample suspected of containing a particular analyte. It is recognized that a sample may contain no analyte, or, in other words, the test for that ligand (a molecule that binds to another molecule) is negative. 
 
The sample can be of biological or environmental origin. 
 
Examples of biological samples include whole blood, serum, plasma, amniocentesis fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, sputum, urine, feces, cerebrospinal fluid, exudates, extracts of skin or tissue specimens, swabs from the throat or wounds and the like. 
 
Examples of environmental samples include water specimens (e.g., drinking water or streams), extracts of soil samples, and swabs of shipping packages, food samples, and the like. In this respect, an “analyte” refers to any material that can be involved in an antibody/antigen reaction. 
 
Typically the analyte will be an antigen, for example, a protein, a carbohydrate, cell walls (e.g., bacterial or fungal cell walls), virus particles and small molecule haptens. Other examples include molecules such as cocaine, morphine, progesterone, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, or DNA. It is also possible that the analyte is an antibody that reacts with a bound antigen or an antibody to the antibody. 
 
Additional Tests and Products for Development
 
The Target System provides the platform for the development of a series of quantitative tests for important diagnostic applications that can provide results at a patient's bedside, in a doctor's office, in the emergency room, in a clinic, in an ambulance, on the battlefield, on-site agri-business locations, rural and economically disadvantaged areas. The Target System expects to meet the POC diagnostic market criteria as follows:
 

Rapid turnaround time 
 
Direct application of a non-critical volume or placement of sample directly into instrument 
 
Disposable device or minimal maintenance required 
 
Minimal technical expertise required 
 
Positive identification and specimen tracking strategy that eliminates specimen identification errors 
 
Simple strategy for calibration and QC 
 
Transferability of data to the LIS or HIS 
 
Agreement of result with accepted “Gold Standard” tests 
 
Affordable cost 
 
The Company’s testing system is not limited to HIV or AIDS diagnostics. The test format has been applied in the past to viral and bacterial infections (e.g., Rubella, Rotavirus, Strep. A) and can be adapted towards other epidemics. Diseases like malaria, cholera, hepatitis, yellow fever, or West Nile virus and other viral diseases present increasing health threats to large populations in the world, with major existing problems at the stage of proper diagnosis. The Company believes that it can adapt the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer and SPARKS Mobile ™ to the rapid, simple POC diagnosis of almost all of these diseases without the requirement of additional equipment. Further, the Company believes that the combination of a mobile, hand-held testing device with a large number of different tests provided by a family of cartridges will improve the ability of current healthcare and disease diagnostics in a vast majority of today’s underserved regions. In addition, the Target System Platform also allows for the monitoring of environmental components influencing the health of populations, such as the presence of toxins in soil and drinking water and contamination of food supply.

SPARKS Mobile™: The Target System Hand-Held Analyzer:
 
The SPARKS Mobile™ is the Company’s next-generation analyzer. Utilizing re-engineered technology of the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer, the SPARKS Mobile™ is a handheld device that will utilize the Company’s TADS test cartridges and include a small, rapid testing format, in conjunction with a data acquisition and test reading, with connectivity and features similar to a smartphone device. The SPARKS Mobile™ is currently in the design stage of the development process.
 

SPARKS Mobile™
 Design Concept

- 12 -

Whether searching for markers in the blood stream, or diagnosing a pathogen in urine, the Company’s SPARKS Mobile™ will be a portable tool for rapid diagnostics. The SPARKS Mobile™ will also provide an improvement in POC diagnostics and applications in countries with limited healthcare infrastructures and geographic limitations, both of which are of paramount importance in the combat against infectious diseases and in the fight against proliferation of endemic and pandemic diseases. This innovative SPARKS Mobile™ will allow for a fast (minutes instead of hours or days) performance of tests at the point of care and will only require a test cartridge and a small number of ready-to-use solutions in preformatted quantities. Moreover, the SPARKS Mobile™ will include the ability to store patient information, test data, and QC data, and transmit data through wireless connections.

The SPARKS Mobile™ design goals will plan to:
 
•
achieve a portable monitoring system, which is compatible with proven and reliable ELISA-based target system technology. 
 •
expand readout capabilities to provide a mobile testing and monitoring platform. 
 •
increase the economy of scale and scope of the diagnostics and monitoring platform by the development of additional utility of the device without redundant infrastructure investments (additional data acquisition of patients, additional tests for other, predominant diseases). 
 
The densimeter/multi-light spectrum reflectometer utilizing immobilized enzyme antigens in blood plasma or urine, which is the core testing system of the VT-1000, will not change. The testing technology in the initial SPARKS Mobile™ testing device will be based upon the same FDA. 510(k) cleared technology employed in the Company’s VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer and is compatible with existing TADS test cartridges. However, a number of innovative features will be integrated into the design to meet customer and patient needs, including those included in the Company’s most recent conceptualization of design and functionality and environmental interface:
 
•
High Infrared Light Spectrum;  
 •
Easy Field Upgrades; 
 •
No Change of Equipment; 
 •
Printer Hook-up Capability; 
 •
Low Entry Cost for New Test Development and Analysis; 
 •
Safety, Security and Accuracy by design; and 
 •
Desk to Docking Station: Smart Phone Capability 
 
The SPARKS Mobile™ is being specifically designed to coordinate with the Target System and the TADS cartridges to provide reliable quantitative results within minutes, right at the point-of-care or site of testing. The continuity of the Company’s product and system upgrades and the continuous development of new tests based on an increasing point-of-care market paradigm, points to the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer and the SPARKS Mobile™ as low cost alternatives to large laboratory analyzers and specialized training of personnel on multiple machinery. The ultimate value to the clinician or the attending physician is the ease of use, reproducibility and the history of accuracy of this type of rapid immunoassay principle in the area of quantitative analysis. 
 
The graphics below represent the Company’s most recent conceptualization of the design components and features for the SPARKS Mobile™, its technology, operational construct and environmental interface:

The Company will continue to develop the design of the SPARKS Mobile™ as well as economic models designed to maximize the value of the SPARKS Mobile™. Although the Company’s 2019 budget does not include 100% of the funding resources to bring the development of the SPARKS Mobile™ to the prototype and beta stages, the Company continues to seek third-party resources, with the goal of obtaining FDA 510(k)-clearance for the SPARKS Mobile™ based upon the FDA 510(k)-cleared VT-1000.
 
Immunoassays: Defined 7
 
Immunoassays are chemical tests used to detect or quantify a specific substance, the analyte, in a blood or body fluid sample, using an immunological reaction. Immunoassays are highly sensitive and specific. Their high specificity results from the use of antibodies and purified antigens as reagents. An antibody is a protein (immunoglobulin) produced by B-lymphocytes (immune cells) in response to stimulation by an antigen. Immunoassays measure the formation of antibody-antigen complexes and detect them via an indicator reaction. High sensitivity is achieved by using an indicator system (e.g., enzyme label) that results in amplification of the measured product. Immunoassays may be qualitative (positive or negative) or quantitative (amount measured). An example of a qualitative assay is an immunoassay test for pregnancy. Pregnancy tests detect the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine or serum. Highly purified antibodies can detect pregnancy within two days of fertilization. Measuring the signal produced by the indicator reaction performs quantitative immunoassays. This same test for pregnancy can be made into a quantitative assay of hCG by measuring the concentration of product formed.

The purpose of an immunoassay is to measure (or, in a qualitative assay, to detect) an analyte. Immunoassay is the method of choice for measuring analytes normally present at very low concentrations that cannot be determined accurately by other less expensive tests. Common uses include measurement of drugs, hormones, specific proteins, tumor markers, and markers of cardiac injury. Qualitative immunoassays are often used to detect antigens on infectious agents and antibodies that the body produces to fight them. For example, immunoassays are used to detect antigens on Hemophilus, Cryptococcus, and Streptococcus organisms in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of meningitis patients. They are also used to detect antigens associated with organisms that are difficult to culture, such as hepatitis B virus and Chlamydia trichomatis. Immunoassays for antibodies produced in viral hepatitis, HIV, and Lyme disease are commonly used to identify patients with these diseases.

Quantitative Immunoassay Analysis
 
Immunoassays are powerful techniques for understanding the role of specific components in complex systems. They work on the basis of the recognition of a specific component (target X) by an antibody or equivalent (affibody, RNA aptamer, recombinant antibody, etc.), which results in the production of a detectable signal. In most cases immunoassays are qualitative, providing information in terms of signal intensity. What is really wanted, however, is quantitative assay providing information in absolute chemical terms, namely the concentration of target X. 
 
Quantitative Immunoassays would allow:
 

Detection of the absolute concentration of components 
 
Reduce inter-assay variation in data 
 
Permit successful statistical analysis of smaller sample sets 
 
Permits direct comparison of data generated at independent sites or occasions. 
 
Quantitative Immunoassays are simple to construct. They require the simultaneous analysis of experimental (or test) samples and calibration standards. The signal intensity generated by calibration standards of known concentration permits conversion of the signals generated by the test samples into absolute units of concentration.
 
Calibration curve
 
A calibration curve (or standard curve) establishes the relationship between the amount of material present and the signal intensity measured. In the case of immunoassays, this would represent the relationship between the epitope concentration and the signal intensity obtained. This relationship is often non-linear, and in many applications displays a dynamic range (or response range) of approximately two orders of magnitude in the concentration of target X.
 
To perform a Quantitative Immunoassay, a set of "calibration standards" containing the epitope in various concentrations, are deployed in the immunoassay alongside experimental "test samples". Densitometry is performed on all data from the assay, and curve fitting used to define the relationship between epitope concentration and signal intensity. This mathematical relationship is then used to convert the signals generated by experimental samples into concentration of target X, which in the Company’s experience is highly accurate.

Molecular Identity of Calibration Standards

For Western Blot applications, a calibration standard is a molecule which contains the epitope feature of an immunoassay covalently bonded to a protein of known molecular weight. Two configurations of this structure are possible (Figure 1), where the epitope structure is either linked to the amino acid backbone (Fig 1a) in the form of a fusion protein or linked to a side chain of a specific amino acid (Fig 1b). 
 


Figure 1: Schematic representation of calibration standard molecules.
 
A set of calibration standards to common epitope tags (His6, c-myc, HA, FLAG, AU1, AU5, glu-glu,) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting (detected via the His6 tag). A single band of 55kDa was detected, and the intensity of signal decreased with decreasing calibration standard loading as expected (Figure 2). 
 


Figure 2: Immunodetection of a serial dilution of His6-calibration standard.
 
Densitometry of the data was performed and the data plotted to define the relationship between epitope amount and signal intensity (Figure 3). Mathematical fitting of the data was performed, with the best fit achieved by "one site-specific binding" analysis (GraphPad Prism) as shown in Figure 3. An excellent fit of the data was achieved using 6 calibration standard concentrations each analyzed in quadruplicate. Similar excellent fits could also be achieved by analysis of fewer standards, with indistinguishable results obtained from 3 calibration standard samples analyzed in triplicate.
Figure 3: Mathematical description of a calibration curve.
 
To determine the epitope concentration of an experimental sample, the mathematical description of the calibration curve is rearranged to calculate epitope concentration from raw signal intensity. Figure 4 displays the quantitative measurement of three "test" samples. Test samples of 2pmol and 0.5 pmol were analyzed and the results obtained were 2.153± 0.127 pmol (mean ± standard error, n=4), 0.552± 0.045 pmol (mean ± standard error, n=4), confirming the accuracy of the measure (Figure 4). Samples should only be analyzed which fall within the calibration range, as errors are higher for observations beyond the confines of the calibration curve e.g. 0.125 pmol in this example. 
Figure 4: Accuracy of Quantitative Immunoassays.
 
In summary, Quantitative Immunoassays are easy to construct and offer several valuable benefits to the researcher. They permit calculation of the absolute concentration of the component of study with high accuracy (error <10%) and high reproducibility. This enhances the quality of research results and also the productivity of research programs by facilitating the direct comparison of data obtained on separate occasions.

Market Opportunities 
 
In recent years, there has been a continuing shift from the use of laboratory-based analyzers to more technologically advanced Point-of-Care tests that can be performed in a matter of minutes. Unlike the centralized clinical laboratory segment, which is mature and highly competitive, the Point-of-Care market is still a relatively early stage market. Although certain simple single analyte diagnostic tests have been developed, such tests have remained incapable of precise and highly sensitive quantitative measurements. As a result, medical tests that require precise quantitation of the target analyte have remained the domain of immunoassay analyzers.
 
Diagnostic tests performed outside the central laboratory or decentralized testing is generally known as Point-of-Care. Over the years, the increasing introduction of transportable, portable, and handheld instruments has resulted in the migration of POC testing from the hospital environment to a range of medical environments including the workplace, home, disaster care and most recently, convenience clinics. Moreover, POC test devices have contributed significantly to the growth of the overall diagnostics market over the past 10 years. As more diagnostic manufacturers pursue CLIA 
8 waiver status for their POC devices and CE Mark 
9 for POC or self-use. At the same time, more decentralized test venues invest in non-waived rapid tests and instruments. POC testing appears to be headed for an even bigger role in diagnosis and monitoring patient care. 
10

The Global In-Vitro Diagnostics (“IVD”) market is expected to exceed $92 billion by 2025, up from $64 billion in 2017 
11, and is expected to continue at a 4.8% compounded annual growth rate over the next eight years. Self-testing is the biggest trend fueling the growth, and the recent advancements in IVD technology has a large influence over the product type segment, which is poised to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 6.1% from 2018 to 2025 
12. The growth is being driven by devices aimed at making acute care more efficient. There is a concerted effort to reduce time spent in expensive intensive care units and in the hospital in general. More tests and technologies have been adapted to serve the needs of physician offices and home testing.
 
Key Drivers
 
The two factors that are significant to the rapid growth of POC testing are technology advancements and healthcare economics. The development of new and improved technologies has resulted in the ability to make evidence-based medical decisions that improve patient outcomes and reduce patient acuity, criticality, morbidity and mortality. Quicker diagnosis of infectious agents can also permit the earlier prescription of appropriate medications, thereby potentially shortening the duration of illness. Additionally, the economic climate is driving significant changes in the manner in which patients will be tested and how results are delivered. Recent revisions to government regulations, together with growing patient and insurer pressures on hospitals and physicians have increased incentives to reduce overall patient healthcare costs while providing a higher level of care to a greater number of patients. One cost-cutting measure is to reduce the high cost of diagnostic testing carried out in central laboratory sites.
Limitations
 
Each of the screening devices described above have limitations in their utility and range of application. Many screening devices have been adopted from their use in clinical laboratories and, when applied to POC application, required special handling of the specimen samples (blood, urine, and feces) and decreased sensitivity and/or specificity.
Competitive Landscape
 
There are approximately 40 to 50 companies in the Point-of Care diagnostic industry in the U.S. and approximately another 100 outside the U.S. 
13. The POC space can be broken down into various sub-sets such as molecular biologist developing reagents, and markers to diagnostic equipment and test development companies, as well as companies who do neither and focus on marketing tests, equipment and assays.  Most notably in the POC space are the large pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer, Roche, Abbott Labs, ThermoFisher and others.  Parallax’s specific competitive landscape is tied to its patented process involving the SPARKS Mobile™ Analyzer and Target System platform In-Vitro Tests.  There are a number of companies developing mobile devices to perform a host of health industry-related services and the Company believes that more companies will enter the mobile diagnostic space in the next few years. The industry has yet to develop a standardized Point-of-Care immunoassay platform for any device to be integrated into.  The Company’s SPARKS Mobile™ Analyzer is designed to deliver a device that adds immediate value to health providers, patients and health insurance companies.

The Company’s primary goal is to create a mobile platform that can integrate and utilize the flow-through process of its Target System platform, and offer the healthcare provider a system that is fully interoperable and ubiquitous with a potentially large number of in vitro tests.  There are other test platforms in the space, but the Company has filed a patent application on the process of its SPARKS Mobile™ Analyzer and TADS test cartridge. There can be no assurance that the Company’s POC devices will prove to be competitive with the other POC devices under development.
 
Until the Company secures a minimum of one million dollars ($1,000,000) of additional capital to operate for the next twelve months it will remain highly vulnerable to competition. The Company anticipates the need for a minimum of an additional two million dollars ($2,000,000) of investment capital for it to achieve its goals of developing a commercially viable rapid POC CD4-CD8 immune status test and the SPARKS Mobile™ Analyzer version of the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer. The Company intends to explore licensing partners for manufacturing and distribution. Should adequate funds be available from future funding resources, the Company may use a small portion of the budgeted proceeds for Research and Development to fund the remaining development of the SPARKS Mobile™ device. However, the Parallax Care™ and Outcomes Platform is the Company’s near term focus. There can be no assurance that such amount will prove adequate to develop the Company’s products. Furthermore, the Company’s competition has significantly greater resources that they can deploy and time to head off competition.

Barriers to Use
 
The main barriers and constraints to the use of POC rapid diagnostic tests can be put into four main categories: 
 
Acceptability:
Rapid tests need to be acceptable to policymakers, clinicians, and patients, and the medical community. In the POC rapid test market, tests need to have sufficient sensitivity and specificity and need to have an adequate predictive value. Ease of use is critical for POC use by clinicians. Culturally appropriate specimens and credible results are important if rapid tests are to be accepted by patients. 
Affordability:
Many rapid diagnostic tests are more expensive than the tests or syndromic algorithms they are intended to replace. Decreasing per-test costs, carefully designing diagnostic algorithms, and educating end users about the cost-savings of POC testing, are important means of maximizing rapid test affordability. 
Availability:
Rapid diagnostic tests are not always available in developing countries. Most tests have limited shelf lives, and many countries have weak public and private sector procurement and distribution systems. The consistency and quality of imported tests can also be issues. To address these constraints, local government regulations, quality assurance, shelf life testing, and distribution systems all need to be assessed and improved. The Company intends to initially control all of the manufacturing of the Target System Desktop and SPARKS Mobile™ analyzers and test cartridges in conjunction with Montecito. 
Reimbursement:
The ability to gain scale in reimbursement across a wide number of tests is still a challenge for POC diagnostic companies such as Parallax.  
 
Intellectual Property (Diagnostics)
 
The Company’s products include a FDA-cleared VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer and more than two dozen FDA-cleared tests. The Company acquired the exclusive rights in perpetuity to a number of pending United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) patent applications on the Company’s products in the area of infectious diseases, as well as methods for future test development, through a License Agreement with Montecito BioSciences, Ltd. The Company intends to seek intellectual property protection for all supporting products such as novel biomarker candidates, antibodies, proteins, and diagnostic tests surrounding its core indication areas, in order to create a barrier to entry for competitors.

Government Regulations
 
The long legal journey toward medical device regulation began with the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906. Medical devices were not included, as no one envisioned how technology would grow increasingly complex, and would ultimately require regulation. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 gave the FDA authority to ensure the safety and effectiveness of a range of life-saving medical devices, while also protecting the public from fraudulent devices. The Amendments:
 
•
defined a medical device, 
 •
established three device classes (I, II, and III), 
 •
identified pathways to market, 
 •
established Advisory Panels, and 
 •
set clinical investigation requirements. 
 
Subsequent legislation strengthened the FDA’s regulatory authority. The following table identifies the legislation and significance for the Major Medical Device:  
 

Legislation | Significance 
---------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 | •Established Quality System requirements 
 | •Supported post market surveillance 
 | •Allowed FDA discretion for PMAs brought to panel 
FDA Modernization Act of 1997 | •Supported for early collaboration, expanded Class I and Class II exemptions 
 | •Set the “least burdensome provision”* 
 | •Supported dispute resolution 
 | •Established evaluation of automatic Class III designation (giving the sponsor the opportunity to •request lower classification due to a minimal risk device, known as “de novo” review) 
 | •Mandated free and open participation by all interested persons 
Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA) of 2002 | •Established a fee schedule for most types of device submissions to achieve shorter review times 
 | •Requires FDA to include pediatric experts on the panel for a product intended for pediatric use 
FDA Modernization Act of 2007 | •Reauthorized and expanded MDUFMA 

 
FDA Clearances and Approvals
 
As part of the regulatory infrastructure, the FDA has established almost 1,700 classifications for generic medical devices. Each one of the generic devices is assigned one of three regulatory Classes, based upon the control level necessary to assure the devices’ safety and effectiveness. The least burdensome provision allows industry and FDA to consider the least burdensome appropriate means of evaluating a device’s effectiveness when there is a reasonable likelihood of its approval. The intent is to help expedite the availability of new device technologies without compromising scientific integrity in the decision-making process or FDA's ability to protect the public health. This provision does not lower the standard for premarket clearance. The FDA maintains a database on its website at www.accessdata.fda.gov for many types of applications, including 510(k) records dating back to 1976, and PMA submissions.
 
FDA Classes
 
Device classifications depend on the intended use of the device, its indications for use, and risk posed to the patient and/or user.
 

Class | Risk Level | Type of Controls | Exemptions
----------+------------+---------------------------------------------+-----------
Class I | Low | General Controls | Yes 
Class II | Moderate | General Controls & Special Controls | Yes 
Class III | High | General Controls & Premarket Approval (PMA) | No 

 
The FDA requires that medical devices obtain either Premarket Notification Clearance (“PNC” or “510(k)”) or Premarket Approval (“PMA”) prior to commercial distribution, unless an exemption is met. Whether to submit a 510(k) or a PMA is determined by the applicant. A 510(k) is normally submitted for a device that can be compared to a similar device already on the market, to illustrate the device’s safety and effectiveness. A PMA is normally submitted for a device that is completely new to the market or is classified as a Class III device. 
 
510(k) Clearance
 
The term “510(k)” refers to Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, wherein it provides a pathway to clearance for a device that maintains FDA standards, without the lengthy and costly PMA submission process. A 510(k) submission for clearance must demonstrate that the device is at least as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to an already legally marketed device. The 510(k) submission must be made at least ninety days in advance of commercial distribution, and if the device meets the requirements, the FDA orders the device as “cleared.”
 
To further illustrate the 510(k) submission requirement, a 510(k) clearance is required when:
 
•
introducing a device into commercial distribution (marketing) for the first time; 
 •
there is a significant change in the safety or effectiveness of a legally marketed device; or 
 •
a legally marketed device is being marketed for a new or different intended use. 

- 20 -

In contrast, a 510(k) is not required when:
 
•
unfinished devices or components are sold for further processing or assembly by other parties, excluding the sale of direct replacement parts to end users; 
 •
the device is not being marketed or commercially distributed; 
 •
distributing another party’s domestically manufactured device; 
 •
repackaging or relabeling, if the condition of the device is not significantly changed; 
 •
the device was commercially distributed prior to May 28, 1976, and no significant changes to design, method, component, method of manufacture or intended use have been made; 
 •
acting as an importer of a foreign made medical device; or 
 •
The device falls into a Class I or II exemption classification; or is a Class III device requiring PMA. 
 
To summarize the 510(k) for Parallax’s VT-1000 Target System, the submission was made to the FDA on December 23, 1988, and received 510(k) clearance on January 27, 1989. In this instance, the clearance process took approximately thirty days. The VT-1000 will not require any further FDA clearance unless there are significant changes in the safety or effectiveness of the device, or its intended use is changed or appended. The same is true for the 25 FDA-cleared tests.
 
Premarket Approval
 
Premarket Approval (PMA) is the most stringent type of device submission required by the FDA. A PMA application must be submitted to request FDA approval to market a device. Unlike 510(k) clearance, PMA approval is based upon a determination that there is sufficient valid scientific evidence that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. PMA submissions include extensive research and development, three-phase clinical trials, and a lengthy FDA review process. 
 
To reasonably assure that a device is safe and effective, PMA requires valid scientific evidence that the probable benefits to health from the intended use of a device outweigh the probable risks, and that the device will significantly help a large portion of the target population. Sources of valid scientific evidence may include well controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, historical controls, well documented case histories by qualified experts, and robust human experience. Independence is an important concept for PMAs, meaning that each PMA should establish the safety and effectiveness of the device under review, and that data about one device cannot be used to support another.  
 
The cost to obtain PMA approval on one novel device can be anywhere from $10 million to $1 billion, and can take an average of 3 to 7 years to bring a device to market. 
14 Examples of PMAs include digital mammography, minimally invasive and non-invasive glucose testing devices, implanted defibrillators, and implantable middle ear devices. 
 
Class III De Novo
 
As indicated in the FDA Classes chart above, PMA submissions are required for all Class III devices, regardless of any similarity to a previously marketed product. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial important in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
 
A “de novo” Class III device is one that was originally submitted for 510(k) clearance, but because the device used for comparison in the 510(k) was “not substantially equivalent” (NSE), the device was automatically denied 510(k) clearance, and was reclassified as being a novel Class III medical device requiring PMA approval. 
 
In the event of a de novo designation of a low to moderate risk device, the applicant may submit a request for consideration to be classified as a Class I or Class II device within thirty days of receiving 510(k) NSE determination. Alternatively, if there is no similar equivalent device for comparison under a 510(k) submission, the applicant may request the FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device as Class I or Class II without ever submitting a 510(k). 
 
Devices that are classified through the de novo process can be marketed and used as predicates for future 510(k) submissions, to be utilized as a “substantially equivalent” device, despite the fact that PMA approval was not provided.
 
Post-Approval Studies
 
The FDA can impose requirements at the time of approval of a PMA or HDE, or by regulation afterwards. One requirement may be the need for post-approval studies. The CDRH Post-Approval Studies Program helps ensure that well designed post-approval studies are conducted effectively and efficiently and in the least burdensome manner. Post-approval studies should not be used to evaluate unresolved premarket issues that are important to the initial establishment of device safety and effectiveness.
 
With post-approval studies, FDA can evaluate device performance and potential problems when the device is used more widely than in clinical trials and over a longer period of time. This allows FDA to build in accountability and gather essential post market information, including: 
 
•
longer-term performance of the device (for example, effects of re-treatments and product changes) 
 •
community performance (clinicians and patients) 
 •
effectiveness of training programs 
 •
sub-group performance 
 •
outcomes of concern – real and potential

Manufacturing
 
The Company does not intend to manufacture in house, with the exception of prototype and small batch production of tests for clinical trials and in-house testing. The Company is required to use manufacturers who operate under Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”). A GMP is a production and testing practice that helps to ensure a quality product. Many countries have legislated that pharmaceutical and medical device companies must follow GMP procedures, and have created their own GMP guidelines that correspond with their legislation. Basic concepts of all of these guidelines remain more or less similar to the ultimate goals of safeguarding the health of the patient as well as producing good quality medicine, medical devices or active pharmaceutical products. In the U.S. a drug may be deemed adulterated if it has passed all of the specifications tests but is found to be manufactured in a condition which violates current good manufacturing practice guidelines. Therefore, complying with GMP is a mandatory aspect in pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Although there are a number of them, all guidelines follow a few basic principles:
 
•
Manufacturing processes are clearly defined and controlled. All critical processes are validated to ensure consistency and compliance with specifications. 
 •
Manufacturing processes are controlled, and any changes to the process are evaluated. Changes that have an impact on the quality of the drug are validated as necessary. 
 •
Instructions and procedures are written in clear and unambiguous language. (Good Documentation Practices) 
 •
Operators are trained to carry out and document procedures. 
 •
Records are made, manually or by instruments, during manufacture that demonstrate that all the steps required by the defined procedures and instructions were in fact taken and that the quantity and quality of the drug was as expected. Deviations are investigated and documented. 
 •
Records of manufacture (including distribution) that enable the complete history of a batch to be traced are retained in a comprehensible and accessible form. 
 •
The distribution of the drugs minimizes any risk to their quality. 
 •
A system is available for recalling any batch of drug from sale or supply. 
 •
Complaints about marketed drugs are examined, the causes of quality defects are investigated, and appropriate measures are taken with respect to the defective drugs and to prevent recurrence. 
 •
GMP guidelines are not prescriptive instructions on how to manufacture products. They are a series of general principles that must be observed during manufacturing. When a company is setting up its quality program and manufacturing process, there may be many ways it can fulfill GMP requirements. It is the Company’s responsibility to determine the most effective and efficient quality process. 
 
Distribution
 
The Company has not yet commenced commercial operations of the Target System, and thus has yet to develop methods of distribution for its diagnostics products beyond the business plan stage.
 
In order to commercially sell the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer, the Company must have it manufactured under GMP. The Company can and will provide demonstrations of the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer capabilities to potential customers.
 
The Company will need to secure additional capitalization before it can acquire additional antibody markers, produce additional Target System cartridges or produce the VT-1000 Desktop Analyzer under GMP.
 
Principal Suppliers
 
The Company has not yet commenced commercial operations of the Target System, and thus has yet to establish principal suppliers of its diagnostics product line.

CONNECTED HEALTH and FOTODIGM® PLATFORM
---------------------------------------

Overview
 
Parallax’s primary goal is to deliver good health outcomes for patients through a service that allows healthcare providers of all types to reduce costs, increase revenues and provide a better patient experience and satisfaction. Connected Health and the Fotodigm® platform are a part of the Company’s overall healthcare strategy. 
 
Fotodigm® is a systems integration software platform that provides remote patient monitoring (“RPM”), medication adherence, and an intelligent telemedicine delivery system. Featuring distinctive data capture and analysis capabilities, the Fotodigm® platform can be promoted directly through hospital and accredited nursing facilities, as well as health and wellness service providers, all seeking to integrate RPM and telehealth services as part of their offerings. 
 
Currently in its beta stage, Fotodigm® integrates remote monitoring solutions to improve a patient’s compliance to therapy, pharmaceutical and other treatment regimens prescribed by their physicians. Through the Fotodigm® platform, alerts and notifications, including visual, audible and vibratory, are sent to patients through email and SMS. In addition, cloud-based recordings are maintained for continuous patient monitoring and telehealth delivery, benefitting both caregivers and patients. FotoDigm® is network agnostic and captures data from any data-generating device, insulin meter, or scale, and works with any analog device, providing easy, flexible data management.
 
Parallax’s Connected Health systems will also offer automated medication dispensing through a patented process, which can reduce the costs and risks associated with noncompliance of medication, therapy and treatment. This can, in turn, increase the financial yields and service delivery successes for healthcare providers, ultimately improving the quality of life and peace of mind for the patient, the doctors and the care providers overall.
 
Biometric Monitoring 15
 
A biometric monitor is a device that measures different aspects of a person’s behavioral or physiological behavior. It basically measures the biological data of a human being. 
 
There are different kinds of biometric monitors that can be used, depending on the purpose. There are monitors that measure the temperature of the body; the pulse rate or the heart activity; blood pressure; blood glucose level etc. Below are a few common biometric monitors that are often used in households and hospitals:
 
•
Thermometers – One of the popular kinds of thermometer is the mercury thermometer which is used to measure the temperature or fever of the body. The mercury expands when heated, and rises up a glass tube, stopping at the corresponding temperature mark. Most thermometers have both Celsius and Fahrenheit readings for the ease of the user. 
 
•
Blood Pressure Monitors – A blood pressure monitor is a device that measures the blood pressure of an individual based on the readings of two values – the systolic pressure, which is the peak pressure in the arteries, over the diastolic pressure, which is the minimum pressure. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly in patients suffering from hypertension or hypotension, and other related conditions. 
 
•
Glucose Monitors – Also known as glucometer, glucose monitors measure a person’s blood glucose level. Glucometers are essential to monitor the glucose in the blood of diabetic patients, as an increase in sugar may initiate serious medical conditions. There are two types of glucometers: continuous glucose monitors, which measure the glucose level every few minutes using small sensors; and the fingerstick glucose monitors that uses a sample of blood to read the glucose level. 
 
•
Pulse Oximeters – Pulse oximeters are used to determine the amount of oxygen in the blood. It is generally used to detect breathing or respiratory problems, and is also used to monitor oxygen saturation in patients under intensive care. There can be three types of pulse oximeters – stand-alone, handheld, or pocket PC –based pulse oximeters. 
 
•
EKG Machines – Electrocardiogram or EKG machines are devices that measure the activity of the heart. It detects the electronic signals sent by the heart in between heartbeats. It is used to detect abnormal activities of the heart induced by sleep, or stress-related problems. EKG machines can be of two types: continuous, which continuously monitors heart activity; or intermittent which records the activity once in a while, but can be used for weeks or months. 
 
•
Pedometers– Used mainly for exercise purposes, a pedometer measures the number of steps a person takes while walking to stay fit. By quantifying the number of steps taken, a person can then calculate the amount of calories burned. Many sports item manufacturers are producing pedometers to help motivate fitness enthusiasts. 
 
There are numerous other biometric monitors used for medical or physical training purposes. There are the calorie counters, the body-fat calculators, the cholesterol monitors, fitness monitors – and a number of other devices. Prices of these vary in accordance with the brand, the quality, and the durability of the product.
 
Many cheap monitors do not give correct readings, and can be deadly when monitoring critical patients. Therefore, biometric monitors should be high-quality products that come with a guarantee, rather than inexpensive brand-less ones. Biometric monitors keep a check on health conditions, and a person should never compromise with their health.

Remote Patient Care
 
The Fotodigm® platform features a full set of modern communications technologies that provide cloud-based Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPPA”) compliant patient data security. The platform was designed specifically for patients’ ease of use, and provides real-time voice and “video conference” communication directly from any mobile or internet-connected device using biometric data collection. The platform, combined with systems integration services that interface with Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and Electronic Medical Records (“EMR”) technology platforms, enables “virtual doctor visits,” increasing the conveniences for both patients and their doctors and care providers. The Fotodigm® platform and its systems integration positioning allows for any physician, clinician, nurse, pharmacist, caregiver, or family member to support the treatment of the chronically ill, both acute and post-acute, in a persistently connected real-time environment, on a larger scale and with greater precision and patient satisfaction. 

RPM benefits are equally important in a residential environment. Seniors and chronically ill residents have shown to require less support and/or interventions, have higher group participation rates and improved cognitive capabilities, as well as an overall improved health, a more assured time with family, and longer residencies, which results in greater value-added contributions and greater job satisfaction from staff members.
 
The ability to remotely monitor each resident, from medication compliance and connected sensors, including vital sign, sleep monitoring, and fall detection devices, enables the residential caregiver to provide a significantly enhanced (and commercially desirable) service for optimal health conditions. With the adoption of a centralized monitoring system, residences will also begin to see a marked reduction in the inter-dependencies that can exist between residents, and an improved state of health for every resident, further reducing the support load on staff members. 
 
Medication Monitoring/Compliance/Adherence
 
Nonadherence with medication is a complex and multidimensional healthcare problem. Patients forget to take their medications, creatively alter their medications, engage in unendorsed polypharmacy, mix their medications, and take medications in combinations that may have dire synergistic interaction effects, such as dizziness and confusion. Estimates of medication nonadherence rates typically range from 20% to 85%, (see figure below) 
16. As a result, a substantial number of patients do not benefit optimally from pharmacotherapy and can wind up in emergency situations, hospitalized, or worse. In fact, hospital readmission generated by medical non-compliance and nonadherence was a $41 billion-dollar problem in the United States in prior years and is growing 
17.
 


Medication adherence is a cornerstone of significantly improved quality of life, and the Fotodigm® platform is the cornerstone of medication adherence. A unique device specifically designed for seniors and the chronically ill, the Fotodigm® platform offers enormous potential for patients, their families, their caregivers and for those residences that choose to offer superior services and a superior health environment for their clients. 
 
The Fotodigm® platform monitors the adherence of treatment and therapy regimens. In addition, with the advent of an intelligent personal medication device with bio-feedback, Fotodigm® allows, perhaps for the very first time, the quantitative and qualitative feedback of real-time data to pharmacists, physicians and clinicians and, based on the individual patient, enables medication titration to achieve optimal medication therapy. 
 
Product Development
 
Parallax is in the development stage of acquiring, licensing and developing in-house solutions/products for personalized health monitoring of seniors that will capture a host of a patient’s vital information, including temperature, heart rate, perspiration and movement disorders. All of these sensor products can be connected to the Fotodigm® platform so that the bio-feedback information is directly correlated with medication consumption information, providing clinicians, pharmacists and physicians with real-time, comprehensive data and information on patients’ conditions. 
 
The Company is reducing to practice the claims of its Fotodigm® data capture technology through internal development and through external technology development partnerships. The Fotodigm® system is being developed to utilize a proprietary Machine Face Recognition engine along with proven and existing Optical Character Recognition (“OCR”) technology through third-party license. The technology has been beta tested and utilized in the field by patients within remote patient monitoring systems for the reduction of hospital readmissions.

Parallax’s customer pilot was able to offer a biometric monitoring capability from devices that were not Internet connected and this lowered the cost of service delivery and sustainability. The pilot for a large hospital group met the requirements of removing the connectivity and cloud based requirements on biometric measurement devices. The focusing on FDA approved measurement devices connected via Fotodigm® allowed for the reduction of costs of telehealth services delivery. The system has been developed in a mobile application that can be downloaded by Parallax end users at the Company’s remote patient monitoring website at www.parallaxcare.com.
 
Product Strategy 
 
Parallax’s product strategy is to eliminate obstructions to consumer adoption of remote patient care systems, so patients can stay out of the hospital longer and have a better quality of care and quality of life.
 
Remote patient monitoring systems enable efficient healthcare delivery to patients outside conventional hospital or clinical settings by transmitting real-time patient data for remote clinical review. Correlating vitals with medication history and consumption directly informs healthcare providers as to the real-time status of a patient, at home or in residences. Anomalies can be reported or alerted to those in need through a cloud-based network. RPM systems incorporate wireless medical devices and computer-based software applications. The evolution of IoT and IoS technologies is clear, and will offer significant business opportunities for patients, residences and the healthcare system in general. RPM is a cost-effective means of keeping patients out of the hospital and have a better quality of care.
 
Product Benefits 
 
RPM systems, even within the walls of a single building, can offer countless benefits for the overall healthcare management of clients. There are countless tangible benefits to medication adherence as well, including significant reductions in hospitalizations, enhanced quality of life, and reductions in the effects of both overmedication and undermedication. Eliminating the distribution and administration of scheduled medications exonerates the residence from the liabilities associated with this task. Human error is all but eliminated. Corporate risks are significantly reduced for this activity and liability insurance premiums may be reduced as well. Essentially, increasing medication adherence through automation, empowerment and monitoring improves patient outcomes and achieves benefits for all health system stakeholders.

Market Opportunities 
 
The market demand for remote patient care (“RPC”) solutions is at an all-time high and continues to increase due to healthcare insurance reimbursement of the services delivered over RPC systems. Further, the move from “fee-for-services” to outcomes-based payment structures have brought about the need for doctors and all other healthcare providers to increase the efficiency and to reduce the costs of care delivery to patients. Clearly, as with the introduction of any new technology, there is a significant market differentiator for early adopters. Residences, assisted living facilities, and long-term care facilities all exist in a competitive environment in which differentiation between them is based upon higher desirability, which amounts to higher profits for those who are able to offer more. Unlike other service businesses, residences have the ability to attract clients requiring services on a long-term basis. 
19 Additional market opportunities exist around hospitals and their management’s needs surrounding the reduction and elimination of patient readmissions.

The global RPM systems market draws immense focus due to strict governmental measures to cut down healthcare expenditure, and reduce hospital stays. Remote patient monitoring serves to minimize hospital readmissions, and reduces the load on physician time, and nursing staff, thus greatly reducing healthcare costs. A rapidly aging population vulnerable to chronic diseases, and a growing desire to live independent lives among the elderly are driving growth in the market. Given the rise in the number of insured patients covered under reforms such as the Affordable Care Act, coupled with stricter reimbursement norms, healthcare providers are under constant pressure to manage wider patient population at lower costs. With the healthcare industry migrating towards an outcome-driven effective healthcare system, remote patient monitoring technology stands optimally positioned for growth.
20
 
Encouraged by the widespread proliferation of high-speed internet, and related services, the adoption of RPM systems is witnessing strong demand. There is growing interest in IoT-driven healthcare services and wearable medical devices that feature sensors, actuators, and other mobile communication methods through which patient data can be continuously transmitted onto a cloud-based platform. Healthcare providers are increasingly adopting cloud computing technologies, which not only offer cost benefits but also allow healthcare organizations to increase operational efficiency.
21
 
The global market for remote monitoring systems is projected to reach over $66 billion by 2020, driven by government measures to reduce healthcare spending against a backdrop widening healthcare budget deficit.
22 As stated by the new market research report on Remote Patient Monitoring Devices, North America represents the largest market worldwide, occupying close to 41% of the total market share, and is expected to grow at an exponential compounded annual growth rate of 21.34% during the forecast period.
23 Asia-Pacific ranks as the fastest growing market with a compounded annual growth rate of 13% over the forecast period. The growth in the region is driven by the increase in per capita healthcare spending and the need for a cost-effective and sustainable healthcare system along with infrastructure capable of addressing the growing healthcare needs of an expanding population.

Misuse of Opioids and Other Addictive Substances
 
During 2017, there were more than 72,000 overdose deaths in the United States, including 49,068 that involved an opioid, according to a provisional CDC count.
25 More than 130 people died every day from opioid-related drug overdoses in 2016 and 2017, according to the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS).
 
There are many organizations talking about the prevalence of this medical problem; however, those working with the addicted population are segmented and fragmented by a limited or narrow scope of work. The clinics and treatment centers are restricted by the need for an on-site appointment for testing and counseling, the hospital emergency rooms are only able to treat the critical physical problem that presents from misuse or overdose and have difficulty finding treatment resources that are readily available for referral to treatment, and the patients who do enter treatment encounter many challenges including access to treatment, frequent appointment schedules making it difficult to maintain employment and lapses in proper chronic disease and pain management.
 
The Company believes that bringing together a number of partners and adding the dimension of population health in-home visits will provide improved, measurable outcomes for the patient and their families. Regularly scheduled home visits can provide the link between the provider, the healthcare plans and patients. 
 
It is also the Company’s belief that education, early intervention and remote patient monitoring can have a significant, positive impact on reducing the misuse of opioids, alcohol, tobacco and other addictive substances. The Community Health Workers (“CHW”) have been providing health screenings and educational classes for chronic disease management and healthy living for several years, and have been successful in identifying potential health risks and referrals for care. The CHW have become respected and trusted advisors and regarded as a link to the healthcare system.
 
Outcomes Optimization Platform monitoring:
 
•
Reduction in number of opioid prescriptions issued; 
 •
Number of individuals attending educational sessions;

The lucrative reimbursement policy introduced by the government agencies promoting the use of telemedicine and virtual health services is driving the market in North America. The U.S. and Canada are the major revenue contributors to the market in North America. Further, the increasing investments in research and development and technological innovations will help major players in the North American region occupy a larger market share over the next few years.
Barriers to Entry
 
Despite the significant potential benefits to outcomes and patient satisfaction that may accrue through the leveraging of patient-generated health data (“PGHD”) in clinical care, data ownership remains a barrier to greater use of PGHD in some circumstances. Though the collection and use of PGHD is intuitive to experienced patients, inclusion of such data represents a shift in the way medicine has been practiced. Taking an active role in the collection and management of data about one’s health status increases patient activation, which is strongly related to better health outcomes in multiple conditions. 
 
Patients’ and providers’ use of mobile health (“mHealth”) apps provide a framework for assessing the role mHealth can play in medicine and as a source of PGHD. Physicians use social media primarily for personal use (60%), though accessing healthcare news (21%), communicating with peers (18%), marketing the practice (11%), and communicating to patients (4%) are also practiced. Among physicians who choose not to use social media, concerns about patient privacy (52%), lack of time (51%), concerns about liability (42%), the belief that social media has little professional value (40%), and lack of familiarity (23%) are cited most frequently. In 2014, two-thirds of physicians surveyed reported using a mobile app to check medication interactions, diagnose a condition, access EHRs, check results, create clinical notes, and prescribe electronically, and more than a third of U.S. physicians recommended their patients use health apps.
26

Questions related to provider licensure pose another potential barrier to the routine use of mHealth. When a patient has his or her radiograph read, many current U.S. state laws require that it be read by a physician licensed in the state where the patient is located and had the radiograph. PGHD can raise special issues. For example, if a patient lives in New York and has an mHealth device that continues to monitor certain aspects of his or her health and the patient crosses three states and then travels into the EU, does the patient’s physician need to be licensed in each of the other three states and in the applicable country in the EU when the data is transmitted from that state or country in the EU? Within the United States, most states require that the out-of-state physician receive an unrestricted license in the state in which the initial patient interaction occurred. Some states issue a telemedicine license to facilitate practice across state lines when the physician holds an unrestricted license in another state. In the radiograph situation, the imaging physician is reading the radiograph at one point in time and billing for that service. With the monitoring of an individual’s health information continuously, the clinician may be being paid to manage the patient’s condition or his or her overall care. The special privacy and confidentiality issues can raise important mHealth implications. It is important that vendors and healthcare systems coordinate their efforts to minimize these issues. 

Competitive Landscape
 
Countless smaller companies around the world are innovating in this sector and are now offering everything from Bluetooth connected toothbrushes and bathroom scales (weight loss or gain is a key indicator of health and disease state) to “wearable’s” that capture everything from body temperature, pulse rates, respiratory rates and blood pressure monitoring to game-changing technologies such as non-invasive blood glucometers that sample blood sugar level several times per second – continuously – without requiring lancets and the drawing of blood samples. 
 
Medical clinics, on a global scale, are already adopting technologies that allow them to provide better healthcare to a wider population base. Insurance companies and HMOs also continue to seek the highest quality healthcare with the highest return on investment by leveraging modern technologies to provide better care to a greater population base at lower cost.
 
There are a large number of companies offering some form of wireless and remote technologies, patient data processing applications and equipment, and electronic medical record data transfer equipment. Competitors supplying advanced patient monitoring and telehealth systems to hospitals are large, established healthcare companies, often working in conjunction with information technology (“IT”) companies on an entire system. The home healthcare and other sectors are much more fragmented and are dominated by privately held companies. In addition, some companies supply innovative products, but only for a small segment of the market; and some companies supply products on a regional basis only. 
 
There is a worldwide interest in “connected health” with major companies such as Philips, Nokia, Apple, IBM, Microsoft and Google, all investing heavily in sensors and sensor systems for healthcare, connectivity and RPM. Traditional telecommunications companies like AT&T, Verizon and a host of others are also investing heavily in healthcare systems and in the RPM market.
 
Major players in the global RPM market include Abbott Laboratories, Aerotel Medical Systems, AMD Global Telemedicine, Inc., BIOTRONIK SE & Co. KG, Boston Scientific Corporation, GE Healthcare Ltd., Honeywell Life Care Solutions, Intelesens Ltd., LifeWatch AG, Masimo Corporation, Medtronic Plc, Mindray North America, Nihon Kohden Corporation, Omron Healthcare, Inc., Philips Healthcare, Qualcomm Life, Inc., St. Jude Medical Inc., and Welch Allyn, Incorporated.

Government Regulations
 
The FDA regulates certain medical devices and also certain mobile medical apps. On September 25, 2013, it issued a Final Guidance that defines “mobile medical app,” as a mobile app that (1) meets the definition of a “device” in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and (2) is intended to be used as an accessory to a “regulated medical device” or to transform a platform into a “regulated medical device.” The Guidance grouped mobile medical apps into three categories: 1) apps that are actively regulated, (e.g., a mobile medical app that monitors the patient’s blood glucose levels and calculates the amount of insulin needed based on the patient’s condition, age, weight, etc.); 2) apps that are subject to enforcement discretion, (e.g., a mobile medical app that provides a patient an alert as to when to take his or her medications); and 3) those that are not considered devices and thus are not regulated (e.g., a mobile medical app that merely provides general healthcare information available on the internet, not directed to a specific patient).

The FDA guidance addresses data security because patients and other users may experience severe consequences should the device lack adequate data protection or be hacked. The guidance does not address the protection of privacy. Rather, privacy is protected by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), where applicable. When patients’ health information is in the possession of health providers, health plans, business associates, or other covered entities, it is protected under HIPAA; when it is transmitted among individuals or organizations that are not covered entities under HIPAA, it is not protected. Accordingly, health information transmitted via a mobile device by a covered entity is protected under HIPAA privacy and security rules. However, this same information transmitted via a non-covered entity under HIPAA is not protected. HIPAA also does not cover information on an individual’s mobile device.

Patient-generated health data (“PGHD”) is merely data of the patient if a patient checks their blood glucose levels with a mobile device. If, however, he or she uses the device to transmit that information to their clinician for the purpose of monitoring that person’s care and the information becomes part of the patient’s electronic health records (“EHR”), the PGHD then falls under HIPAA.
 
The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) is not hesitant to file complaints against companies that it believes fail to reasonably protect the security of consumers’ personal data, including medical information. In August 2013, FTC filed a complaint against LabMD, Inc., alleging that the medical testing laboratory exposed the personal medical information of more than 9,000 consumers by placing the information on a peer-to-peer file-sharing network. The filing followed the discovery of the personal information of several hundred consumers who used LabMD’s services in the possession of identity thieves. In this case, as in an earlier case against a medical transcription firm that exposed personal medical information on the public internet, FTC is acting to enforce HIPAA’s security requirements. 
 
The Company makes patient security an utmost priority. With the Company’s secure HIPAA-compliant cloud-based system, a patient can have confidence that their personal HER, EMR and PGHD is protected with the highest level of technology available.
 
FTC also regulates misleading claims. If in the sale or distribution of a mobile medical app or device one makes claims about what the device can do, FTC can bring an action to make the individual or entity cease and desist from making such claims. In 2013, FTC published a written guidance and a short video for mobile app developers that offer advice on creating apps that protect users’ privacy and comply with truth-in-advertising principles.

Principal Suppliers
 
As of December 31, 2018, the principal suppliers of the medical devices utilized with the Fotodigm® platform were:
 

•Amazon Web Services, Seattle, WA | HIPAA-compliant secure server environments for hosting and management of Fotodigm® platform 
-----------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
•La Frontera’s Empact Suicide Prevention Center, Tempe, AZ | Largest CARF (Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities) certified behavioral health suicide prevention call center in United States. 
•Royal Phillips, Inc. 1070 MX Amsterdam, The Netherlands | Primary RPM software and hardware supplier; platform built upon Salesforce.com infrastructure providing clinical, monitoring center, and patient management portals for mobile and desktop access.

 
The Company relies upon these suppliers to provide the majority of the delivery of its remote patient monitoring systems and services. The services are web-based and although the Company relies on these vendors, it can also hold them accountable, receive volume-based pricing, discounts and partnership advantages through the competition of its suppliers. The Company has the ability to change vendors at any time in all service and product lines. Further, the Company is working towards the elimination of its reliance on software and hardware providers related to its in-home RPM offerings and services.

On April 26, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of certain intellectual property from ProEventa Inc., a Virginia Corporation (“ProEventa”), in accordance with the Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement between the Company and ProEventa (the “ProEventa Agreement”). ProEventa has an expertise in the development of behavioral health technologies, and is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Grafton Integrated Health Network, Inc., a non-profit Virginia corporation (“Grafton”), Pursuant to the ProEventa Agreement, in exchange for 100% of that certain intellectual property, among other things, consideration to ProEventa included:
 
•
a stock purchase agreement to purchase 2,500,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock; and 
 •
a revenue sharing agreement, providing for a cash earn-out to be paid to the ProEventa shareholders of up to $3,000,000, to be derived from certain net revenue generated by the Company, as defined in the agreement; and 
 •
a royalty agreement, providing for a royalty of 3% of the revenues generated from the intellectual property, ending at such time as the Company has paid ProEventa $25,000,000; and 
 •
a limited license to ProEventa for the use of certain of the Intellectual Property’s technology at Grafton Schools. 
 
On April 26, 2017, in conjunction with the ProEventa Agreement, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with James Gaynor, founder of ProEventa, that, among other things, provides for consideration to Mr. Gaynor as follows:
 
•
a stock purchase agreement to purchase 500,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at $0.001 per share; and 
 •
a grant of options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a price of $0.25 per share, vesting annually over a three (3) year period beginning September 1, 2017. 
 
With the completion of this acquisition, the patented technology entitled “Platform for Optimizing Data Driven Outcomes,” is added to the Company’s patent portfolio. 
 
Product History
 
For over a decade, Grafton School, Inc. (“Grafton”), a Virginia corporation, perfected a manual system of outcomes developed by Dr. Lisa Marshall and James Gaynor, that re-invented utilizing cloud computing and the internet. In March 2014, ProEventa, Inc. (a Latin word meaning, “Good Outcomes”), and wholly-owned subsidiary of Grafton, was formed, and began marketing the software based on rights granted by Grafton. REBOOT™ (“REBOOT™”), an acronym for Reliable Evidence-Based Outcomes Optimization Technology, is the behavioral health platform, and was developed to provide goal obtainment through mastery of skills in a customized and fully automated data analysis and intervention model.
 
The technology is supported by applied behavioral analytics and over 25 years of efficacy studies and reduction to practice at Grafton, combined with over $3.75 million-dollar invested to transition the system to a cloud-based platform with mobile applications. 

- 29 -


Goal Mastery 27
 
In 2004, Grafton Health’s CEO, Jim Gaynor, asked his leadership team to provide the percentage of goals clients at Grafton mastered annually overall and within specific programs and services. While observations and anecdotal reports from Grafton providers and stakeholders indicated clients were showing improvement in their identified goal areas, there was not a system in place to provide an actual goal mastery rate. Out of this request, Grafton’s “Goal Mastery Initiative” was created. 
 
The goal mastery process was designed to provide a structured and sustainable system to identify, monitor, and evaluate client progress and to embed data-based decision-making into the transdisciplinary treatment and instruction planning. There are several steps to this process: (1) conducting a thorough assessment of the individual’s strengths and needs, (2) writing goals that are functional, measurable, and specific to the needs, (3) collecting data, typically on a weekly basis, (4) graphing data and comparing them to a Minimum Growth Line, (5) determining level of progress according to a specific standard, and (7) providing a reporting mechanism to identify goal mastery rates at all levels within the organization. When the data trend indicates the goal is not on track for mastery, six primary decision-support factors (Six M’s) are explored to help the transdisciplinary team evaluate the situation and make recommendations for changes to treatment and instruction. After an initial baseline goal mastery rate of 35% when this initiative first started and progressive increases over the year, Grafton has maintained a goal mastery rate at or above 80% for the past several years. 

The Company has licensed the improved REBOOT™ technology platform for systems integration into the diagnostics and remote patient care systems. The next step in the Company’s commitment to data-based decision-making is the introduction of website and mobile technology to support the goal mastery process. The REBOOT™ technology will be made available to organizations, individual providers, and family members who want to effectively track individuals’ progress and use the Company’s evidence-based process for increasing goal mastery. 
 
Ultimately, through the goal mastery process and the deployment of REBOOT™, the Company will continue to provide individuals with the support they need to make meaningful and sustainable improvements in their functioning and quality of life.
 
Product Strategy 
 
The patented feature set of the REBOOT™ platform allows it to provide progressive-predictive analytics and goal optimization intelligence on concurrent and compounding goals for an individual or group of people. Its’ utility is broad and has use cases in many vertical growth markets. 
 
The product strategy is to enter the market through the healthcare initiative of the Company’s remote patient care and diagnostics divisions. The integration of REBOOT™ is a key differentiating advantage within the remote patient care market.  The software can be harnessed to assess and prioritize patient goals, provide interventions, track behavioral data and provide meaningful feedback toward goal obtainment, as well as real time decision support with robust progress reporting. The resulting decision and patient support, combined with the remote patient care and diagnostics technologies, make for a technology advantage and a feature set that is designed to take away market share from competitors and capture new client accounts in healthcare field focused on doctors, nursing operations, and hospitals. 
 
The technology can be marketed through user licensing or enterprise licensing contracts within the healthcare market, in both platform and supported mobile applications, including the Company’s application known as COMPASS™  (“COMPASS™”).
 
The Company believes that healthcare organizations for the first time will have the opportunity to “scale” their patient adherence programs while having visibility into its effectiveness and bottom-line impact. Individual users will have a goal wizard, virtual coach and rules engine that will help create a path toward wellness. With personalized analysis, decision support and “goal” mastery feedback, the individual will be primed, guided and motivated to adhere to their treatment plan.
 
REBOOT™ is also applicable to many vertical markets outside healthcare.  The short-term strategy is to monetize the patented technology in healthcare, and license to non-competitive companies within other market verticals. The Company is assessing and prioritizing the licensing prospects. The management team is also monitoring and identifying patent infringement, and some, already identified, are being assessed for licensing value. 
Behavioral Healthcare Industry
 
Per a Behavioral Health Services 2016 Report by Capstone Partners, the demand for behavioral health services will continue to grow due to increased awareness and affordability of mental health and substance abuse treatment options. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (“SAMHSA”), expenditures on mental health and substance abuse treatment are estimated to have reached $239 billion in 2014. By comparison, expenditures only totaled $42 billion in 1986 and $121 billion in 2003. More specifically, revenues generated by the substance abuse treatment industry reached an estimated $29.8 billion in 2015, a 3.5% growth over the prior year and 2.9% annual growth rate since 2006. Industry revenues are expected to grow 2.6% annually to reach $33.9 billion by 2020. There are a variety of factors that impact growth of the substance abuse treatment market, including development of new treatments, drug availability and healthcare reform.

Industry Drivers
 
Increased Exposure to Drugs and Alcohol
 
In the United States, illicit drug use and alcoholism have grown significantly among all age groups due to increased availability of prescription drugs and medication. This has resulted in an unfortunate trend of increased prescription medication abuse by secondary school and college-aged young adults.
Development of New Treatments and Programs
 
Clinical advancements in therapy and medication management have yielded new and better procedures for both psychological and detoxification treatments. Over the past several years, medication-assisted opioid therapy, which allows patients to rid their system of substance dependence through new-aged medication treatments, has led to an increased demand for treatment. Another driver is the future need for clinics to provide youth, elderly and gender-specific programs.
Healthcare Reform and Affordability
 
Healthcare in the U.S. has undergone significant changes in recent years that are favorable for the substance abuse treatment industry. Healthcare reform, specifically the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (“MHPAEA”) and the Medicaid Certified Match Substance Abuse Program (“MCMSAP”), has led to more affordable substance abuse treatment.
Growth in Private Insurance
 
In the five years following the 2014 health insurance exchange implemented by healthcare reform, the number of people with private health insurance is predicted to significantly increase.
Increased Awareness
 
One of the biggest challenges for the industry has been the reluctance of substance abusers and addicts to undergo treatment. Individuals afflicted by substance abuse typically refuse treatment due to the social stigma associated with admitting they have a problem or lack of knowledge about the treatments available. However, recent efforts by health and government agencies have resulted in greater public awareness and acceptance of substance abuse as a disease.
Autism Disorder and Treatment Industry
 
Although the specific causes of autism are still not known, one thing is. The rate is increasing, and the market for treatment is growing.
 
Based on new government data, as of 2017, 1 in 45 children in the United States, aged 3-17, have autism. This is up from only 1 in 150 children back in 2000.
 
Research firm, Market Data’s March 2018 report entitled, “The U.S. Autism Treatment Market,” states that market data analysts estimate that there are currently 1.4 million American children with autism. Another 700,000 adults have autism, having “aged out” of children’s programs, and, 81% of autistic children are male.
 
The total annual costs for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (“ASD”) in the United States in 2017 were estimated to be between $11.5 billion and $60.9 billion - a significant economic burden.
 
Insurance coverage is a problem, but the share of children with access to insurance coverage is expected to increase from the 36% level today. In addition, the number of self-funded private employers covering autism treatment continues to grow.
 
Autism Treatment Options
 
In the past, it was thought that the best way to treat the symptoms of autism was to medicate. Data suggest that approximately 58% of patients with a diagnosis of childhood autism receive some type of pharmaceutical treatment. However, this segment of the market has been shrinking in value as concerns continue over the side effects of commonly used drugs.
 
Today, this attitude is changing, as Applied Behavior Analysis (“ABA”) programs have become more widespread and have displayed good outcomes. There are basically three types of ABA program providers: brick and mortar centers, community providers, and in-home therapists.
 
Many autism treatment organizations, and some of the largest competitors, are located in California. This is due to the fact that funding for treatment programs has been in place there since the 1990s, prior to the insurance mandates that were later put into place.

Autism Market
33
 
The U.S. autism treatment market was estimated to be valued at $1.85 billion as of 2016, growing to $1.87 billion last year. Market data forecasts 3.9% average yearly growth, to $2.23 billion by 2022. This could be conservative, as insurance coverage is improving. In addition, venture capital firms are starting to take notice of investment opportunities in this market.
 
The average ABA center grosses about $821,000, and many are non-profit organizations. Many programs now have waiting lists, and there is a shortage of qualified supervisors.
 
Nine large multi-site ABA program providers operate an estimated 296 brick and mortar centers, and employ thousands of therapists. Together, they account for about $390 million in revenues, representing a 38% market share of ABA programs.

Government Regulations
 
Mental health and substance abuse services are subject to many federal, state and local regulations regarding licensing, operations, facility ownership, reimbursement rates and procedures. These regulations and strict licensure requirements create high barriers to entry for the industry. Licensing prerequisites typically relate to the provider’s medical qualifications, personnel and equipment, staff-to-patient ratio, adequate records maintenance, rate-setting and compliance with standard building and safety codes. Expansion of substance abuse facilities are also subject to state regulations. The construction of new facilities; expansion of existing facilities; transfer or change of ownership; and the addition of new beds, services or equipment may be subject to state laws that require prior approval by regulatory agencies under Certificate of Need (“CON”) laws. CON laws generally require that a state agency determine the public need for construction or acquisition of facilities/addition of new services.

The HIPAA regulations also have a unique impact on the Company, as they impact the management and controls of the data it collects and encounter throughout the Parallax operations. Also, the state and local governments’ Medicare and Medicaid payments and reimbursements require consistent and diligent management, both in following the advantageous changes in the move towards connected healthcare and greater reimbursements. There are also regulations and requirements with each approved connected healthcare treatment. Lastly, there are American Medical Association regulations over U.S. medical practices that affect how the Company’s business is operated, requiring both compliance and alignment with its customers, who require unique reporting and other data and service-related processes as a result of these, and other, regulations.  
 
Principal Suppliers
 
As of December 31, 2018, the principal suppliers for the Behavioral Health platform were:
 

•Amazon Web Services, Seattle, WA | HIPAA-compliant secure server environments for hosting and management of REBOOT™ and COMPASS™.
-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
•La Frontera’s Empact Suicide Prevention Center, Tempe, AZ | Largest CARF-certified behavioral health suicide prevention call center in United States. 

 
The Company relies upon these suppliers to provide the majority of the delivery of its behavioral health platform products and services.  The services are web-based and although the Company relies on these vendors, it can also hold them accountable, receive volume-based pricing, discounts and partnership advantages through the competition of its suppliers. The Company has the ability to change vendors at any time in all service and product lines. Further, the Company is working towards the elimination of its reliance on software and hardware providers related to its in-home behavioral health offerings and services.
