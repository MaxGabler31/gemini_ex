Item 1. Business
Overview
 Our mission is to provide universal access to world-class learning so that anyone, anywhere has the power to transform their life through learning.

Learning is the source of human progress. The spread of ideas across cultures and ages has helped transform our world from illness to health, from poverty to prosperity, and from conflict to peace. By combining some of the world’s best educational content with a technology platform that can serve learners on a global scale, we believe Coursera will enable the digital transformation of higher education and bring high-quality, affordable education to every corner of the world.

Coursera is a platform that enables a global ecosystem of educators, learners, organizations, and institutions. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 97 million learners had registered on Coursera to learn from more than 250 leading university and industry partners through thousands of offerings ranging from open courses to full diploma-bearing degrees. Coursera serves learners in their homes, through their employers, through their colleges and universities, and through government-sponsored programs. As of December 31, 2021, over 800 organizations were paying Enterprise customers, including businesses, colleges, universities, governments, and governmental agencies. We also provide social impact programs that have helped more than 120,000 learners around the world.




   As of December 31, 2021
 
Technology is advancing faster than the world’s ability to adapt and acquire new skills, resulting in a sizable and expanding skills gap. To be productive members of the workforce in the digital economy, many aspiring professionals need advanced skills in technology and information-based analytics. We believe education’s “new normal” will be characterized by blended classrooms powered by online learning, job-relevant education, and lifelong learning at work to help employees keep up with the emerging skills needed to compete in an accelerating digital economy. We believe that online learning will become the primary means of meeting the global demand for emerging skills and that the adoption of online education, combined with the increased flexibility enabled by remote working, holds the promise to increase global social equity.
 
World-class teaching is the foundation of the Coursera experience. Coursera partners with over 250 leading university and industry partners to provide learners content and credentials that are modular, stackable, and consumable at a wide range of durations, difficulty levels, and price points. Our data-driven technology platform enables educators to efficiently produce, teach, and scale content and credentials, from individual courses to professional certificates to diploma-bearing degrees. Coursera enables educator partners to tap into global demand from individual learners, organizations, and institutions.

Reaching and serving a world of learners lies at the heart of our model. We make it easy for learners to discover and engage with high-quality, job-relevant learning in flexible, hands-on online learning environments at affordable prices—including free offerings. Free content from top-branded partners has enabled us to attract approximately 97 million individual learners at very low cost and build a global consumer brand. Data-driven marketing enables us to efficiently upsell learners a wide range of paid offerings, including stand-alone courses, multi-course Specializations, certificate programs, and university degrees. Learners can also “stack” content and credentials, allowing completion of stand-alone courses to count as progress towards a broader program of study, creating more flexible and affordable paths to upskilling and reskilling. We believe this efficient learner acquisition model has allowed us to build one of the largest global audiences of adult learners in the world and to serve learners at various price points, with competitive margins for us and for our educator partners.

Coursera’s data and machine learning systems drive personalized learning, effective marketing, and skills benchmarking. We believe that our unified technology platform is not only making global higher education more accessible and more effective, but is also enabling educators to author and distribute high-quality content efficiently, employers to upskill and reskill their talent, and learners to advance their careers in a flexible learning environment.

In addition to offering content and credentials directly to individuals at Coursera.org, we also sell directly to organizations and institutions, including employers, colleges and universities, and governments. Employers can use Coursera for Business to help employees develop new skills in order to better acquire and serve customers, lower costs, reduce risk, and remain competitive in the new digital economy. Colleges and universities can use Coursera for Campus to deliver university-branded online learning at lower cost in the United States in a new era of financial challenges for higher education and evolving student preferences for hybrid learning. Governments, facing high levels of unemployment driven by automation and accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic, can use Coursera for Government to reskill and upskill employees and citizens into fast-growing digital roles that constitute a significant share of new job opportunities.

The global higher education market is large and growing, at a size of $2.2 trillion in 2019, according to HolonIQ Smart Estimates. As we press our advantages to continue penetrating this market opportunity, we have multiple strategies to drive our growth, including increasing adoption and penetration of our Enterprise offerings for companies, universities, and governments; expanding the number of online degrees and the number of students in Degrees programs; continuing to grow our learner base and build our brand; growing our content and credentials catalog and network of educator partners; improving conversion, upsell, and retention of paid consumer learners; and continuing our global expansion.

Our business has experienced rapid growth since our founding in 2011. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, our revenue was $293.5 million and $415.3 million, respectively. We continue to invest in our business and had a net loss of $66.8 million and $145.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

Our Social Impact Programs and Pandemic Response

Coursera Social Impact Programs
Universal access to world-class learning is critical for social change. Over the last five years, we have fostered an initiative to provide underserved learners with access to high-quality education that supports personal development, career advancement, and economic opportunity. Through our social impact programs, we have worked with more than 100 nonprofit and community organizations to provide free access to our learning resources for more than 120,000 learners across the globe. These learners have collectively logged more than 225,000 course enrollments during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Our Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
 The COVID-19 pandemic sharply increased the need for online learning beginning in 2020. Individuals, organizations, and institutions relied on online learning to navigate change and disruption. We, along with our partners, launched several initiatives to help mitigate the pandemic’s impact on communities worldwide:
 
1) Campus Response Initiative: To help minimize the economic and educational impact of the pandemic, we and our partners launched the Campus Response Initiative on March 12, 2020, offering every college and university in the world free access to our course catalog through Coursera for Campus. Within seven months, the initiative reached 2.3 million students from over 4,000 institutions who collectively logged more than 19 million course enrollments. We and our partners concluded our Campus Response Initiative in September of 2020 but continue to provide a freemium offering, Coursera for Campus Basic, which allows universities and students access to Guided Project enrollments to enable trial before purchase. In addition, university and industry partners who offer multiple courses on our platform may elect to join our Partner Consortium, which affords these partners free access to other members’ courses.
 
2) Workforce Recovery Initiative: We and our partners launched the Coursera Workforce Recovery Initiative on April 24, 2020 to help governments provide unemployed workers with free access to the Coursera catalog to help them develop skills needed to become re-employed more quickly. We and our partners have subsequently concluded this initiative, during which, we activated more than 340 programs across more than 100 countries, including those participating through an intergovernmental organization, and 25 U.S. states, with more than 1 million learners and 8 million course enrollments. We surveyed Workforce Recovery learners three months after completing their first course, and over 80% of respondents reported that Coursera learning helped them to gain a new skill.
 
3) Employee Resilience Initiative: Launched April 30, 2020, the Employee Resilience Initiative enables Enterprise customers to expand online learning opportunities for employees with free access to high-demand courses focused on mental well-being, remote working, and digital readiness.
 
4) Contact Tracing Course: On May 11, 2020, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health launched a free COVID-19 Contact Tracing course on Coursera to help expand contact tracing capacity. This course is offered with subtitles in more than 10 languages to make this critical content more accessible worldwide. To date, over 1.3 million learners have enrolled in the course.

Learners
 Learners can come to Coursera to advance their careers, reach their educational goals, and enhance their lives. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 97 million learners had registered with Coursera to learn from more than 250 leading university and industry partners in thousands of offerings ranging from open courses to full diploma-bearing degrees. Coursera serves learners in their homes, through their employers, through their colleges and universities, and through government-sponsored programs. We offer learners a broad range of learning offerings, from a 2-hour Guided Project for $9.99 on how to build a website to a Master of Public Health degree from the University of Michigan for approximately $45,000.

•The top five countries represented by registered learners on Coursera as of December 31, 2021 were (1) the United States, with 18.1 million registered learners, (2) India, with 14.9 million registered learners, (3) Mexico, with 5.0 million registered learners, (4) Brazil, with 3.9 million registered learners, and (5) China, with 3.4 million registered learners.
 •In 2021, learners logged 37 million course enrollments, watched 372 million lectures, and completed 63 million assessments. 
 •Learners have logged more than 3.9 million Guided Projects enrollments since we launched Guided Projects in 2020. 
 •Our growing Professional Certificate catalog has enrolled 3.7 million learners since we launched this catalog in 2018.
 •Over 16,000 students were enrolled in Degrees programs as of December 31, 2021.

Overall, learners are satisfied with their experiences on Coursera and with the outcomes Coursera learning helps them achieve. Of learners who have rated a course in 2021, 81% gave their course a full 5-star rating.

Businesses
Employers can use Coursera for Business to help employees develop new skills in order to better acquire and serve customers, lower costs, reduce risk, and remain competitive in today’s economy. The launch of our Enterprise segment in 2016 has enabled customers to choose Coursera to reskill and upskill their teams with critical skills in business, technology, data science, and other disciplines.
•These organizations include more than 800 Paid Enterprise Customers that purchase Coursera through our direct sales force, as well as on our platform through our Coursera for Teams offering; or through our channel partners. 
 •Over 65% of Coursera’s direct sales business customers are outside of the United States. 
 •In 2021, Coursera for Business learners logged over 1.8 million course enrollments.
 
Colleges and Universities
Colleges and universities can use Coursera for Campus to deliver university-branded online learning at lower cost in the United States in a new era of financial challenges for higher education and evolving student preferences for hybrid learning. We launched Coursera for Campus in October 2019, just months before the COVID-19 global pandemic broke out. Coursera for Campus enables colleges and universities to leverage our global online learning platform to provide job-relevant, credit-ready, high-quality learning at higher scale and lower cost than in-classroom learning alone. Accelerated by the pandemic, thousands of higher education institutions launched Coursera for Campus over the past year, making it one of our fastest growing offerings.

Through the Coursera Campus Response Initiative, more than 4,000 colleges and universities used content from our platform to launch online learning programs that ran for free through September 2020. During that time, these institutions launched more than 13,000 programs for 2.3 million students who accounted for more than 19 million course enrollments. Universities utilizing the Campus Response Initiative included Duke Kunshan University, Tec de Monterrey, and GITAM University among others. We and our partners concluded our Campus Response Initiative in September of 2020, but continue to provide a freemium offering, Coursera for Campus Basic, which allows universities and students access to Guided Project enrollments to enable trial before purchase.

Governments
 Governments, facing unprecedented levels of unemployment, can use Coursera for Government to build a competitive workforce that drives sustainable economic growth by upskilling employees for public sector success and reskilling citizens for career advancement.

Through the Coursera Workforce Recovery Initiative, government agencies representing more than 100 countries launched more than 340 online learning programs that ran for free through December 2020. During that time, more than 1 million learners joined and logged more than 8 million course enrollments. Governments participating in the Workforce Recovery Initiative included multi-national institutions such as the Commonwealth of Learning, national governments in countries such as Colombia and Kazakhstan, and state and local governments such as Illinois and New York.

Our Competitive Strengths: The Power of Our Business Model
We believe that our competitive advantage is based on the following key strengths:

 Trusted brand with a large learner base: With approximately 97 million registered learners, we have one of the largest global audiences of adult learners in the world. This large learner base attracts top educator partners, creates Enterprise and Degrees leads, provides data and insights, increases operating scale, improves search engine optimization performance, and produces favorable economics.
 Our consumer flywheel creates a price-to-cost advantage: We make it easy for learners to come to Coursera and explore learning options through free open courses and projects. We believe this efficient acquisition model, powered by free, high-quality content, global partner brands, deep expertise in search engine optimization, strong word-of-mouth referrals, public relations, and a profitable affiliate paid marketing channel, enables us to attract learners to Coursera at scale and connect them with the right learning experiences over the course of their academic and professional lives.




 Branded catalog of modular and stackable content and credentials: Our broad catalog and flexible technology platform provide many entry points for learners and allow us to give learners a path to achieving their goals, regardless of their starting place. This allows us to help learners find the right learning program based on their prior skills, credentials, experience, and career desires and provide pathways for them to accomplish their goals. For example, a learner with no college degree or experience might start her learning journey with the Google IT Professional Certificate over 3 to 6 months, land a new IT job, and get academic credit towards the University of London Bachelor’s of Computer Science, which she can complete while working, lowering the opportunity cost of earning that degree. We believe we are the only platform with the ability to blend industry credentials with traditional academic degree credentials at scale.

 Network of leading academic and industry partners: Our large and global learner base attracts top-tier educator partners by allowing them to reach new audiences and create new revenue streams with relatively small up-front investments. We carefully select our university and industry partners, prioritizing quality, subject expertise, and geographic appeal. As technology advances and new relevant skill sets emerge, our growing partner relationships enable us to be responsive in providing in-demand skills for aspiring and ascending professionals.

 Job-relevant, hands-on projects, and industry certificates: In order to compete and keep pace with the rapidly changing skills landscape, learners need to be able to quickly identify and learn practical skills using job-relevant tools. Our Project Network is composed of instructors who have demonstrated expertise in a tool or skill through industry experience or academic background in the topic of their project. Our technology platform allows instructors to efficiently launch one to two hour Guided Projects that teach the latest in-demand skills to learners with a hands-on learning experience. Similarly, Professional Certificates, some of which are authored by well-known employer brands such as Google, IBM, Intuit, Meta, and Salesforce, allow learners to efficiently reskill and upskill for new jobs.

 Multi-channel Enterprise model: With a single content catalog and a unified technology and data platform, we are able to distribute content and credentials to a global audience of more than 800 paying businesses, academic institutions, and governments. Our technology enables our educator partners to reach large, globally-distributed employee populations through the workplace and provide them with high-quality lifelong learning. Our technology also allows collaboration among institutional networks, so that businesses, universities, and government agencies can collaborate on Coursera by sharing content, program settings, licenses, and data insights.
 
 Rich data analytics and Skills Graph: Since all of our teaching and learning activities happen online, our platform is able to capture a significant amount of data across millions of enrollments related to teaching, learning, content, and outcomes. These data allow us to drive learner success through personalized learning, mapping skills to content and jobs through a system of machine learning models, and unlocking marketing efficiencies by automating and targeting communications with learners to generate engagement.

Our Opportunity: The Global Education Market is Large and Growing
As the pace of new knowledge and the demands of the global workforce continue to accelerate, we believe the global adult education market is poised to grow dramatically. According to the education market intelligence firm HolonIQ, the global higher education market was $2.2 trillion in 2019; the global online degree market was $36 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow. The flexibility of online learning enables non-traditional learners to continue their education, which has allowed the online education industry to demonstrate acyclical growth characteristics.
Our Growth Strategy
We have seen strong growth since our founding in 2011. The combination of greater global access to technology and our open learning platform is unlocking the opportunity for more global citizens to enhance their education and earn credentials that help advance their careers. We believe that we have a large, underpenetrated addressable opportunity ahead of us to enable the digital transformation of higher education and provide lifelong adult learning at scale.
 
Key elements of our strategy of growing our business include:

 Continue to invest in growing our Enterprise channels. Coursera’s growth is driven in part by expansion into new logos as well as broader penetration of learners within our existing base of business, university, and government customers. Our team identifies and engages with potential Enterprise customers. Once our platform has been adopted, we focus on expanding and growing our relationships with existing customers. Our relationships often begin with departmental deployments, evolving to multi-department and ultimately organization-wide utilization as our value is evangelized and proven within our customers’ learner base.

 Drive adoption and conversion of freemium Enterprise offerings. During the pandemic, we opened up our platform across our Enterprise customer base through multiple initiatives including our Campus Response Initiative, Workforce Recovery Initiative, and Employee Resilience Initiative. As an example, our Campus Response Initiative enabled over 4,000 institutions globally, including approximately 10% of all degree-granting institutions, to tap into ready-made, high-quality digital curricula from leading universities with minimal upfront costs through our Coursera for Campus offering. We plan to continue to focus on converting free institutions to paying Enterprise customers as we enable the digital transformation of higher education.

 Expand the number of online degrees and the number of students in Degrees programs. We believe we have a substantial opportunity to increase the number of bachelor’s and master’s programs and postgraduate diplomas in new and existing academic disciplines within our current network of university partners. Over time, we also aim to naturally progress current open course university partners into Degrees partners. For existing Degrees program partners, we also intend to continue to increase the size of student cohorts in existing Degrees programs and add new online Degrees programs from these partners. We believe that our ability to leverage our large, global learner base gives us a competitive advantage in delivering qualified international learners to Degrees partners in a cost-effective manner.

 Continue to grow our learner base and build our brand. We intend to continue to invest in increasing the number of registered learners on Coursera and increasing awareness of the Coursera brand. Our large learner base and brand creates a virtuous cycle, increasing our value to educator partners and providing incentive for them to author additional content and credentials. This broader catalog, in turn, enhances the appeal of Coursera to learners, which grows our consumer learner base. We believe the content and credentials from our university and industry partners generate meaningful organic and unpaid traffic to Coursera, which reduces our cost of learner acquisition. A growing learner base also generates positive externalities for other parts of our business, as some learners will go on to enroll in Degrees programs or provide us with Enterprise leads.

 Grow our content and credentials catalog and network of educator partners. We plan to continue to invest in growing our catalog of projects, courses, Specializations, certificates, and degrees across a broad range of topics and expanding our network of educator partners.

 Improve conversion, upsell, and retention of paid Consumer learners. Our Consumer platform makes it easy for individuals to come to Coursera and learn, allowing for a natural progression of learners to go from free projects or courses to full online degrees. In 2021, over 60% of our cash receipts from Consumer offerings came from individual learners who were registered on our platform as of December 31, 2020.

 Continue global expansion. Approximately 49% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 came from learners outside of the United States. We see a particularly large opportunity to help emerging economies that lack the ability to absorb the large and growing influx of adult students by delivering education in a scalable and affordable way. We plan to continue to market our offerings and programs to individual learners, businesses, academic institutions, and governments globally, providing us broad access to the addressable market while also building on our global brand as a leading learning destination.

Competition
 The market for global adult online learning is highly fragmented and rapidly evolving. We expect alternative modes of learning to continue to accelerate as players in this industry introduce new and more competitive products, enhancements, and bundles. Participants in the global adult online learning ecosystem include:

•Direct-to-consumer, online education companies: 2U, Inc., through its subsidiary edX Inc., and FutureLearn Limited; 
 •Companies that provide technology solutions and services to universities offering online learning programs: 2U, Inc., Eruditus Learning Solutions Pte. Ltd., Noodle Partners, Inc., and upGrad Education Private Limited; 
 •Corporate training companies: Degreed, Inc., LinkedIn Corporation through its LinkedIn Learning services, Pluralsight, Inc., Udacity, Inc., and Udemy, Inc.; 
 •Providers of free educational resources: Khan Academy, Inc., The Wikipedia Foundation, Inc., and Google LLC (“Google”) through its YouTube services; and 
 •Internal online degree platforms: Online degree programs developed in-house by universities. 
 
We believe we have a number of advantages over these competitors due to our unique combination of:
•a trusted global brand; 
 •a base of approximately 97 million registered learners; 

•a freemium consumer model that creates a price-to-cost advantage; 
 •a broad catalog of branded, high-quality content and credentials; 
 • job-relevant, hands-on projects and industry certificates; 
 •a network of over 250 leading university and industry educator partners; 
 •a multi-channel Enterprise model serving more than 800 paid Enterprise customers; and 
 •rich data analytics and Skills Graph. 
 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on building a unified marketing system that connects individuals to lifelong learning opportunities throughout their academic and professional lives. Our strategy centers on leveraging the Coursera brand and our partners’ brands along with our large catalog of high-quality, freemium content to attract learners to Coursera efficiently.

Once we attract learners to Coursera, our data-driven learner experience connects learners to the courses, certificates, and degree programs best-suited for them through a personalized discovery and nurture system and identifies whether they are a potential Enterprise prospect.

Learners come to Coursera primarily through free or low-cost acquisition channels such as public relations, word of mouth, and search engine optimization. We also derive a smaller percentage of learners through cost-efficient paid advertising channels including an affiliate publisher network and paid search.

With our consumer brand, we can market categories of degree and certificate programs to learners earlier in their consideration process. This allows us to connect learners with targeted learning opportunities based on their background and goals. By connecting Coursera’s learners with relevant degree programs, we efficiently tap into latent degree demand from the consumer base and combine automated nurture strategies earlier in the funnel with higher-touch efforts to assist potential students who are further along in their purchase decision. We promote courses, Specializations, and MasterTrack Certificates that can count as progress towards a degree both to allow prospective students to discover Degrees and to increase conversion rates by enabling applicants to sample content and build interest and confidence before enrolling in a Degrees program.

The data from Coursera’s consumer ecosystem helps drive Enterprise marketing efficiency. Related insights, especially on how a company’s skill proficiencies stack up relative to the competition based on the aggregated learning behaviors of consumer learners working at a given company help us reach prospects with targeted skill development solutions.

Our Enterprise sales team identifies and engages with potential organizational and institutional customers around the world. With our international expansion, we have deployed a more regionally distributed approach to sales and account management and see significant upside in growing and upselling Enterprise accounts.

Research and Development
We have a technology and data-driven research and development team which creates and maintains our platform, products, and insights to deliver a high-quality learning experience to our customers and educator partners cost-effectively and at scale. We leverage our large partner and customer base, our engaged learner community, and our focus on user-driven innovation to aggregate feedback on features and functionality and consistently improve our offerings and platform.
 
Our production environment runs on a cloud, providing scalable storage and elastic computing. This architecture allowed our platform to effectively serve a 15x increase in registrations at peak hours during a pandemic-related surge in activity in late March 2020.
    We invest substantial resources in research and development to drive our technology innovation and bring new offerings and features to the market. Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, and testing of features and offerings on our platform. They are also responsible for building and integrating tools and systems to help our services function deliver high-quality service at lower cost as we scale.

Our research and development teams are located in Mountain View, California, Toronto, Bulgaria, and an increasingly distributed remote workforce that allows us to access diverse, talent-rich markets as we grow. We believe our research and development teams are diverse, bringing unique and essential perspectives to our platform.

Public Benefit Corporation Status
On February 1, 2021, we amended our certificate of incorporation to become a Delaware public benefit corporation. We believe becoming a public benefit corporation reinforces our long-term commitment to providing global access to affordable and flexible world-class learning and aligns with our mission, culture, and values.
 
Public benefit corporations are a relatively new class of corporations that are intended to produce a public benefit and to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner. Under Delaware law, public benefit corporations are required to identify in their certificate of incorporation the public benefit they will promote, and their directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct, and the specific public benefit identified in the certificate of incorporation. They are also required to publicly disclose a report that assesses their public benefit performance at least every two years.
 
Our public benefit purpose, as provided in our certificate of incorporation, is “to provide global access to flexible and affordable high-quality education that supports personal development, career advancement, and economic opportunity.”

Certified B Corporation Status
In addition to being a public benefit corporation under Delaware law, we are a Certified B Corporation (“B Corp”). The term “B Corp” does not refer to a particular form of legal entity, but instead refers to companies that are certified by B Lab, an independent nonprofit organization, for meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.

The process for becoming a B Corp involves taking and passing a comprehensive and objective assessment of a business’s positive impact on society and the environment, which includes over 200 questions measuring the business’s impact on its customers, employees, communities, and the environment, as well as a validation process which includes review of supporting documentation and verification interviews. Once certified, every B Corp must make its assessment score publicly available on B Lab’s website. Acceptance as a B Corp and continued certification is at B Lab’s sole discretion.

We believe that our status as a B Corp further demonstrates our commitment to our mission and public benefit purpose. Additionally, we believe that maintaining our status as a B Corp will further strengthen the relationship of trust between us, our partners, our customers, and our employees as we together seek to empower anyone, anywhere to transform their life through learning.

Regulatory Matters
As a service provider to higher education institutions both in the United States and internationally, either directly or indirectly through our arrangements with partners, we are required to comply with certain education laws and regulations.
General
 Higher education is heavily regulated in the United States and most international jurisdictions. For example, numerous states require education providers to be licensed or authorized in such a state simply to enroll persons located in that state into an online education program or to conduct related activities such as marketing. Additionally, the vast majority of our U.S.-based college and university partners participate in the federal student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (“HEA”), and are subject to extensive regulation by the DOE, as well as various state agencies, licensing boards and accrediting agencies. To participate in the Title IV programs, an institution must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE, and be certified by the DOE as an eligible institution. The increased scrutiny and results-based accountability initiatives in the education sector, as well as ongoing policy differences in Congress regarding spending levels, could lead to significant changes in connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the HEA or otherwise. These changes may place additional regulatory burdens on postsecondary schools participating in the Title IV programs generally, and specific changes may be targeted at companies such as ours that serve higher education within the United States. Regulatory activities and initiatives of the DOE may have similar consequences for our business even in the absence of Congressional action.
 
The regulations, standards, and policies of our college and university partners’ regulators are complex, change frequently and are often subject to differing interpretation. Changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, or standards could compromise our college and university partners’ accreditation, authorization to offer online learning in various states or countries, permissible activities, or access to federal funds under the Title IV programs. We cannot predict with certainty how the requirements applicable to our college and university partners will be interpreted, including in the case of new laws or regulations for which no, or insufficient, interpretative guidance exists, or whether our college and university partners will be able to comply with these requirements in the future. Some regulations were designed to regulate in-person, correspondence or other types of learning experiences not offered online and may be difficult to interpret or apply to the types of programs offered by our partners on our platform. In addition, there is no assurance that degrees or certifications earned through an institution in one jurisdiction will be recognized as valid or sufficient in other jurisdictions, including internationally, for employment, to satisfy prerequisites for advanced degrees, or other opportunities. Our international college and university partners are subject to similarly extensive legislation, regulation and oversight.

Authorization and Approval
Our U.S.-based college and university partners are required to obtain the appropriate approvals from the DOE and applicable state and accrediting regulatory agencies for new programs. Similar approvals and reviews may be required for programs from our partners based outside the United States, and for our partners to offer programs in other countries.

Our partners, both U.S. and international, may also be required to be authorized in certain states to offer online programs, engage in advertising or recruiting, and operate externships, internships, technical training, or other forms of field experience, depending on state law. Although many of our programs are offered by U.S.-based higher education institutions that hold such authorizations or participate in an appropriate state reciprocity agreement such as the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement ("SARA"), other partners are not traditional education institutions or operate outside the United States and do not hold such state authorizations. Some institutions, including California higher education institutions, currently do not participate in SARA.

We or our partners may also be required to obtain appropriate approvals under international education laws and regulations. For example, a recent Indian regulation relating to online higher education requires, among other things, that learning platforms utilized by Indian universities to offer online degrees be approved by a technical committee of the Indian regulator.

Accreditation
 Accrediting agencies primarily examine the academic quality of the instructional programs of an educational institution, and a grant of accreditation is typically viewed as confirmation that an institution or an institution’s programs meet generally accepted academic standards. Accrediting agencies also review the administrative and financial operations of the institutions they accredit to ensure that each institution has the resources to perform its educational mission. The DOE also relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether institutions qualify to participate in Title IV programs.

Although we are not an accredited institution and are not required to maintain accreditation, accrediting agencies are responsible for reviewing an accredited institution’s third-party contracts with service providers like us and may require that an institution obtain approval from, or notify the accreditor in connection with, such arrangements. We work closely with our university partners, which are accredited institutions, to assure that the applicable standards of their respective accreditors are met.

DOE “Dear Colleague Letter”
Each institution that participates in Title IV programs agrees, as a condition of its eligibility to participate in those programs, that it will not “provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid, to any person or entity who is engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity, or in making decisions regarding the award of Title IV HEA program funds.” The vast majority of our U.S.-based partners participate in the Title IV programs. Although this rule, referred to as the incentive compensation rule, generally prohibits entities or individuals from receiving incentive-based compensation payments for the successful recruitment, admission, or enrollment of learners, the DOE provided clarifying guidance in March 2011 interpreting the incentive compensation rule as permitting tuition revenue-sharing arrangements known as the “bundled services exception.” Our current business model relies heavily on the bundled services exception to enter into tuition revenue-sharing agreements with partner colleges and universities.

The DCL issued by the DOE on March 17, 2011 sets forth the official guidance of the DOE regarding various regulations that were implemented around that time. The DCL affirms that “[t]he Department generally views payment based on the amount of tuition generated as an indirect payment of incentive compensation based on success in recruitment and therefore a prohibited basis upon which to measure the value of the services provided.” The DCL, however, in Example 2-B, clarified an important exception to this prohibition for a business model that complies with the bundled services exception: “A third party that is not affiliated with the institution it serves and is not affiliated with any other institution that provides educational services, which third party provides bundled services to the institution including marketing, enrollment application assistance, recruitment services, course support for online delivery of courses, the provision of technology, placement services for internships, or student career counseling, may receive from an institution an amount based on tuition generated for the institution by the third-party’s activities for all bundled services that are offered and provided collectively, as long as the third party does not make prohibited compensation payments to its employees, and the institution does not pay the third party separately for student recruitment services provided by the entity.”

The DCL guidance indicates that an arrangement that complies with Example 2-B will be deemed to be in compliance with the incentive compensation provisions of the HEA and the DOE’s regulations. Our business model and contractual arrangements with our U.S.-based partners are designed to follow Example 2-B in the DCL. However, the inherent ambiguity in the DCL and the incentive compensation rule creates the risk that DOE or a court, including, notably, in the context of a “whistleblower” claim under the federal False Claims Act, could disagree with that interpretation. If the DOE or a court determined that our business model or even the practices of a subcontractor did not meet the bundled services exception, we could have contractual obligations to our U.S.-based partners such as indemnifying a partner from private claims or government investigations or demands for repayment of Title IV program funds.

Further, because the bundled services rule was promulgated by agency guidance through the DCL and is not codified by statute or regulation, there is risk that the exception could be altered or removed without prior notice, public comment period, or other administrative procedural requirements that accompany formal agency rulemaking. Although the DOE has not publicly stated an intention to rescind the DCL or alter its guidance, the bundled services exception could be reviewed, altered, or vacated in the future. In addition, the legal weight the DCL would carry in litigation over the propriety of any specific compensation arrangements under the HEA or the incentive compensation rule is uncertain. We can offer no assurances as to whether the exception in the DCL would be upheld by a court or how it would be interpreted.
 
Misrepresentation Rule
Under our contracts with U.S.-based college and university partners, we are required to comply with regulations promulgated by the DOE and comparable state laws that affect our marketing activities, including the misrepresentation rule. The misrepresentation rule is broad in scope and applies to statements our employees or agents may make about the nature of a partner’s program, a partner’s financial charges, or the employability of a partner’s program graduates.
 
Specifically, the HEA prohibits an institution that participates in the Title IV programs from engaging in any “substantial misrepresentation” regarding three broad subject areas: (1) the nature of the school’s education programs, (2) the school’s financial charges, and (3) the employability of the school’s graduates. In 2010, as part of the program integrity rules, the DOE revised its regulations in order to significantly expand the scope of the misrepresentation rule. Although some of the DOE’s most expansive amendments to the misrepresentation rule were overturned by the courts in 2012, most of the 2010 amendments survived and remain in effect.

Violations of the misrepresentation rule are subject to various sanctions by the DOE and violations may be used as a basis for legal action by third parties. Similar rules apply under state laws or are incorporated in institutional accreditation standards and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) applies similar rules prohibiting any unfair or deceptive marketing practices to the education sector.

FERPA
 We are required to comply with FERPA. FERPA generally prohibits an institution of higher education from disclosing personally identifiable information from a learner’s education records without the learner’s consent. Our U.S.-based university degree and certificate partners and Coursera for Campus customers and their learners disclose to us certain information that originates from or composes a learner education record under FERPA. Through our contracts to provide services to institutions, we are indirectly subject to FERPA, and we may not transfer or otherwise disclose any personally identifiable information from a learner record to another party other than in a manner permitted under the statute and any applicable contract. In the event that we disclose learner information in violation of FERPA, the DOE could require a partner to suspend our access to their learner information for at least five years.

Human Capital Resources

Overview
 At Coursera, we create and nurture a system of equitable employee services and workplace experiences to help employees perform at their best and to deliver our mission of transforming lives through learning. As of December 31, 2021, 1,138 full-time employees make up a global community that is driven by a shared purpose and transformative impact. Our team also engages contractors and consultants for auxiliary services and support.

Our focus on building a great place to work has resulted in a strong culture that values, innovation, and results at scale. Our employees are proud to work at Coursera and of the positive social impact that we can make together. To further enable our ability to grow and fulfill our public benefit objectives, we continue to invest in attracting, retaining, and developing team members while enhancing diversity and inclusion in our workforce.
 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
 Building a more diverse company powers our ability to deliver on the mission of Coursera: it fuels the performance and innovation we need to provide universal access to world-class learning and it inspires collaboration to help us create a more just world alongside our government, university, and industry partners. Our DEI initiatives and programs also strengthen our workplace culture and support talent acquisition and retention goals. We will continue investing in our DEI strategies to enhance workplace diversity, promote cross-cultural learning, and advance our ongoing efforts to build a company where everyone can thrive. We approach DEI through three strategic pillars: workplace, workforce, and marketplace.

Workplace: Diversity of identity, voice, background and experience are all key elements of our employee value proposition. We will continue to drive meaningful change in our representation while strengthening brand credibility within under-represented population (URP) communities by building, assessing, and evolving our goals for attracting, engaging, hiring and growing talent.

Workforce: As an organization, we will work to deepen our commitment to DEI into the makeup of our workforce and the evolution of our values and culture. We will focus on early and consistent engagement with various communities and tracking inclusive practices. That means taking a deeper look into equitable talent pipeline development, hiring, and advancement across our diverse talent pools.
 
Marketplace: The mission of Coursera sits at the core of our commitments and our DEI journey. As we evolve, we recognize the impact to our learners and partners. We want to ensure that they are represented in our content, product, brand and business strategy.
 
Talent
 We build distributed teams of diverse talent that represent our global community of learners in order to inspire the innovation that will transform lives through learning. We do this through embracing a work from anywhere hiring strategy to attract and retain top global talent. Similar to the ways in which we help millions of learners transform their lives through courses and degrees on our platform, we also encourage and empower Coursera employees to learn and grow at work. We offer learning programs and tools to support employees on their personal learning journeys and to promote organizational learning objectives. Through our internal learning program called SkillUp, employees have access to a sizable catalog of courses, specializations, and certificates on the Coursera platform to help employees build job-relevant skills and advance their careers. Employees can also choose to go deeper: For employees who are accepted into select degree and MasterTrack Certificate programs on Coursera, we proudly offer scholarships that cover 100% of tuition and fees. We aspire for Coursera to be a place where employees are challenged and stretched, and intend to continue investing in employee development opportunities that enable team members to maximize their impact and grow their careers.
Total Rewards and Pay Equity
We provide competitive compensation. Compensation at Coursera is fair, regularly benchmarked to be market-competitive, and focused on performance. To align compensation and performance, we have established an on-going cadence for performance reviews that supplement a culture that is core to Coursera of regular, open, and casual feedback.

Furthermore, our compensation practices are designed to help ensure fair and equal pay to all employees regardless of gender, identity, race, age or other protected characteristics. We routinely audit our pay structures to identify possible pay disparities and opportunities to improve our pay practices.

Properties
 Our headquarters are in Mountain View, California. All of our offices are leased, and we do not own any real property. We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations. We also anticipate that suitable additional or alternative space, including those under lease options, will be available at commercially reasonable terms for future expansion.

(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
1.ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Description of Business
Coursera, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), is an online learning platform that connects learners, educators, and institutions with the goal of providing world-class educational content that is affordable, accessible, and relevant. The Company combines content, data, and technology into a platform that is customizable and extensible to both individual learners and institutions. The Company partners with leading university and industry partners (“educator partners”) to bring quality higher education to a broad range of individuals, businesses, organizations, and governments. The Company also sells directly to institutions, including employers, colleges and universities, and governments, to enable their employees, students, and citizens to gain critical skills aligned to the job markets of today and tomorrow. The Company’s corporate headquarters are located in Mountain View, California.
Initial Public Offering
On April 5, 2021, the Company completed its initial public offering ("IPO") of common stock, in which it sold 14,664,776 shares. The shares were sold at a price to the public of $33.00 per share for net proceeds of $452,482, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $31,456. Upon completion of the IPO, $6,449 of deferred offering costs were reclassified into additional paid-in capital as a reduction of the net proceeds received from the IPO. Upon the closing of the IPO, all outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 75,305,400 shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.

On April 19, 2021, the underwriters exercised in full the right to purchase 2,359,500 additional shares of common stock from the Company, resulting in additional net proceeds of $72,802 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $5,061.

 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation—The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
Principles of Consolidation—The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Segment Information—The Company defines its segments as those operations the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), determined to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, regularly reviews to allocate resources and assess performance. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company operated under three segments: Consumer, Enterprise, and Degrees. The Company continually monitors and reviews its segment reporting structure in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 280, Segment Reporting, to determine whether any changes have occurred that would impact its reportable segments. For further information on the Company’s segment reporting, see Note 14 “Segment and Geographic Information.”
Use of Estimates—The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to fair value of common stock and stock-based awards; period of benefit for capitalized commissions; internal-use software costs; useful lives of long-lived assets; the carrying value of operating lease right-of-use assets; valuation of intangible assets and income tax expense, including the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, among others.

 The World Health Organization declared in March 2020 that the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (“COVID-19") constitutes a pandemic. Since early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused general business disruption worldwide beginning in January 2020. The global impact of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, and the Company will continue to actively monitor the situation, including progress made through vaccinations, and the effects on its business and operations. The Company does not yet know the full extent of potential impacts on its business or operations or on the global economy as a whole, particularly if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time. Given the uncertainty, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact on its future results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. As of the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require it to update its estimates, judgments, or the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained and are recognized in the consolidated statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Cash and Cash Equivalents—The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Marketable Securities—Marketable securities consist of corporate debt, commercial paper securities, and U.S. government Treasury bills, with an original maturity greater than three months at the date of purchase and are classified as available-for-sale securities. As the Company views these securities as available to support current operations, it has classified all available-for-sale securities as current assets. Available-for-sale securities are initially recorded at cost and periodically adjusted to fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity (deficit), while realized gains and losses are reported within other income (expense), net as a component of net loss. An impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for declines in fair value below the cost of an individual investment that are deemed to be other-than-temporary. The Company did not identify any marketable securities as other-than-temporarily impaired during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Restricted Cash—As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company had letters of credit of $2,548 and $2,061, respectively, related to its corporate headquarters’ operating lease agreement.


Accounts Receivable—Accounts receivable includes billed and unbilled receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on the Company’s assessment of the collectibility of accounts. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts by considering the age of each outstanding invoice; each customer’s expected ability to pay; and the collection history with each customer, when applicable, to determine whether a specific allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified. The allowance for doubtful accounts and related activities were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.


Property, Equipment and Software—Property, equipment and software are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the remaining lease term.

Deferred Offering Costs—Deferred offering costs consist primarily of direct and incremental legal, accounting, and other fees related to the Company’s IPO. Prior to the IPO, all deferred offering costs were capitalized in prepaids expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Upon completion of the IPO, $6,449 of the deferred offering costs were reclassified into stockholder's equity as a reduction of the IPO proceeds.

Leases—The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease and the classification of that lease, if applicable, at inception based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether the Company has a right to direct the use of the asset. For leases that commenced before the Company's adoption date of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases, (“ASC 842”), the Company elected the practical expedients to carryforward its historical lease classification, its assessment on whether a contract was or contains a lease, and its initial direct costs. The Company also elected to not separate lease and non-lease components and to not recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities that arise from short-term leases (i.e., leases with a term of 12 months or less).

 The Company applies ASC 842 to individual leases of assets. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of minimum remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, the Company considers contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors. The Company’s lease agreements may contain variable costs such as common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred in the consolidated statements of operations.

ROU assets are initially measured at amounts that represents the present value of the lease payments over the lease, plus any initial direct costs incurred and less any lease incentives received. Annually, all ROU assets are reviewed for impairment. The Company’s lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.

Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, and current and non-current operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease costs for operating lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company does not have any finance leases.

  Internal-Use Software Development Costs—The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with developing its internal-use software during the application development stage when management with the relevant authority authorizes and commits to the funding of the project, it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. These costs include personnel and related employee benefits expenses for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to software projects. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, which is approximately two years. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incurred and recorded in research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company capitalized internal-use software costs of $5,884, $9,785 and $16,980 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.


Intangible Assets—Intangible assets with finite lives are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization. The Company amortizes its intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three to six years.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets—The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, including property, equipment, software, and finite-lived intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. There were no impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021

Revenue Recognition—The Company derives revenue from contracts with customers for access to the learning content hosted on its platform and related services. The Company derives its revenue from three sources: Consumer, Enterprise, and Degrees. Refer to Note 14 ”Segment and Geographic Information" for disaggregation of revenue.

Consumer Revenue—The Company generates revenue from the sale of access to course content to consumers. Consumer products include certifications for single courses, Specializations, and catalog-wide subscriptions. Access to single courses are generally purchased at a fixed price for a set period of time, typically six months. Specializations are a series of courses offered by the same educator partner where learners are provided access to these courses on a month-to-month subscription basis. Coursera Plus is the Company’s catalog-wide consumer subscription product, and it is sold in the form of a monthly or annual subscription. All contracts with Consumer customers are billed in advance, generally after a 7-day free trial period. The Company recognizes revenue ratably over the contracted period, after access has been granted to the consumer, as learners have unlimited access to the course content during the contracted period.

Consumer learners are entitled to a full refund up to two weeks after payment is received. The Company estimates and establishes a refund reserve based on historical refund rates. The refund reserve was immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.

 Enterprise Revenue—The Company sells subscription licenses to business, government, and university customers that provide users the ability to enroll in courses and Specializations and receive certifications upon completion. Enterprise contracts are typically between one and three years in length and can consist of either the purchase of a fixed quantity of seat licenses, each of which allows for unlimited course enrollments by one learner for each year or the purchase of a quantity of course enrollments. In either contract type, the Company recognizes revenue ratably over the contracted period, after access has been granted to the Enterprise customer, as learners have unlimited access to the course content during the contracted period.

The Company is the principal with respect to revenue generated from sales to Consumer and Enterprise customers as the Company controls the performance obligation and is the primary obligor with respect to delivering access to course content. Additionally, the Company has inventory risk through recoupable advances sometimes paid to educator partners.

Degrees Revenue—University partners contract with the Company for the delivery of bachelor’s and master’s degrees or postgraduate diplomas awarded by the university. The Company’s Degrees revenue contracts involve the performance of a number of promises, including but not limited to hosting the degree content on its learning platform, providing content authoring tools, course production support, and marketing and platform technical support services. As a result, the university partner is the Company’s customer with respect to Degrees revenue. The Company earns a Degrees service fee that is determined based as a percentage of total tuition collected from Degrees students, net of refunds, by the university partner. University partners generally collect the tuition from Degrees students, however in the case of some MasterTrack Certificate offerings this obligation can be the Company's responsibility. The Company has a stand ready obligation to perform degree services continually throughout the period that the degree content is hosted on our platform. Degrees revenue is earned and paid by the university partner for each university term. As a result, revenue generated from each term is recognized ratably from the start of a term through the start of the following term.

The Degrees learning experience is delivered on the same proprietary learning platform used by Consumer and Enterprise customers. There is no direct contractual revenue arrangement between the Company and Degrees students, who contract directly with university partners. Further, the university partners typically have additional performance obligations to the Degrees students in the form of designing the curriculum, setting admission criteria, real-time teaching, making admission and financial aid decisions, independently awarding credits, certificates or degrees, and academic or career counseling. Although some MasterTrack Certificate learners are required to accept the terms and conditions prior to tuition payment, the Company's core performance obligations remain similar to the services provided to university partners for their online bachelor’s and master’s degrees or postgraduate diplomas. For these reasons, the university partners control the delivery of degrees hosted on its platform. As a result, the Company recognizes Degrees revenue as the service fee it receives from the university partner.

For all customers, revenue from contracts is recognized when control of promised services is transferred. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. To achieve this, the Company applies the following five steps:

1) Identify the contract with a customer
The Company determines a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new Enterprise or Degrees customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. Consumer revenue customers are required to pay in advance either prior to the Company providing access to course content or prior to the expiration of a 7-day free trial.

2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract
Performance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services and the products is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Customers do not have the ability to take possession of the software supporting the platform and, as a result, contracts are accounted for as service arrangements.

For sales to Consumer and Enterprise customers, the Company’s performance obligation generally consists of providing access to its platform and related support services, which is considered one performance obligation. Access to the Company’s platform represents a series of distinct services, as the Company continually provides access to, and fulfills its obligation to, the customer over the contract term.

 Degrees services involve the performance of a number of promises that include hosting the degree content on the Company’s platform, degree program management, marketing and platform technical support services, each of which are a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same, are satisfied over time using the same measure of progress and as a result are considered one performance obligation to stand ready to perform an online degree hosting service for the duration of the degree.

3) Determine the transaction price
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur. None of the Company’s contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other indirect taxes).

The Company’s Degrees services revenue is determined based on a fee percentage applied to the total tuition collected from Degrees students, net of refunds, by the university partner. As a result, the revenue earned by the Company is dependent upon the number of learners enrolled and the tuition charged by the university partner. This is a form of variable consideration. The Company estimates the amount of revenue, using an expected value method, that it expects to be entitled to in return for performance of the Degrees services, subject to assessment of the significant future reversal constraint discussed above. These estimates are continually evaluated until such time as the uncertainties are resolved, generally at the time the final term enrollment report is provided by the university partner.

4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract
Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. As noted above, for Consumer and Enterprise customers, access to the Company’s platform and related support services are considered one performance obligation in the context of the contract and, accordingly, the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation. Similarly, Degrees services are considered one performance obligation and the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.

5) Recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied
Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of the promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to the Company’s platform and related support services by Consumer and Enterprise customers are considered one performance obligation, and the related revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term as the Company satisfies its performance obligation.

The Company has a stand ready obligation to perform Degrees services continually throughout the period that the degree content is hosted on its platform. Degrees revenue is earned and paid by the university partner for each university term. As a result, revenue generated from each term is recognized ratably from the start of a term through the start of the following term.

Contract Assets and Liabilities—Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts in the period that the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. Payment terms on invoiced amounts are typically 30-60 days. The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. If revenue is recognized prior to the Company’s unconditional right to consideration, a contract asset is recorded. Deferred revenue consists of cash payments received in advance of performance obligations being delivered and is recorded as current or noncurrent based on the related period in which services will be provided.

Contract Acquisition and Fulfillment Costs—Contract acquisition costs consist of sales commissions and related payroll taxes associated with obtaining contracts with Enterprise customers.

Deferred Commissions—Customer acquisition costs are primarily related to sales commissions and related payroll taxes earned by the Company’s Enterprise sales force, which are incremental costs to obtaining a contract. Sales commissions and related payroll taxes for new and upsell Enterprise contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which is estimated to be three years. The Company determined the expected period of benefit by taking into consideration the length of terms in its Enterprise customer contracts, the life of the technology, and other factors. The Company amortizes these costs over three years since the commissions paid upon a contract renewal are not commensurate with the commissions paid on the initial contract and as such, the sales contract period is not commensurate with the expected period of benefit. Commissions and related payroll taxes paid for Enterprise contract renewals are amortized over the renewal term, which is generally two years.

 Deferred commissions and related payroll taxes that will amortize within the succeeding 12-month period are classified as current and included in deferred costs in the consolidated balance sheets. The remaining balance is classified as noncurrent and included in other assets.

Deferred Partner Fees—These fulfillment costs are paid to educator partners in advance of the Company’s performance obligations being completed; are recorded within current assets or other assets, depending on the timing of the related revenue recognition; and are amortized into cost of revenue ratably over the term of the access being provided.

Cost of Revenue—Cost of revenue consists of content costs in the form of a fee paid to educator partners and expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of the Company’s platform. These expenses include the cost of servicing both paid learner and educator partner support requests, hosting and bandwidth costs, amortization of acquired technology and internal-use software, customer payment processing fees, and allocated depreciation and facilities costs.

Fair Value Measurements—Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the “exit price” that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between independent market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. The classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, are as follows: 


 | As of December 31, 2020 | 
 | Fair Value | | Level 1 | | | Level 2
Financial assets: | | | | | | 
Cash equivalents—money market funds | $ | 58,997 | | $ | 58,997 | | $ | — 
Marketable securities: | | | | | | 
Corporate debt securities | | 8,551 | | | — | | | 8,551 
Commercial paper | | 26,469 | | | — | | | 26,469
U.S. government Treasury bills | | 170,382 | | | 170,382 | | | — 
Total financial assets | $ | 264,399 | | $ | 229,379 | | $ | 35,020


 | As of December 31, 2021
 | Fair Value | | Level 1 | | 
Financial assets: | | | | | 
Cash equivalents—money market funds | $ | 539,091 | | $ | 539,091
Marketable securities: | | | | | 
U.S. government Treasury bills | | 241,117 | | | 241,117
Total financial assets | $ | 780,208 | | $ | 780,208


The Company remeasures certain assets, including intangible assets and its equity-method investment in a private company, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there are identifiable events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of these assets. No such events or changes occurred during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Concentration of Credit Risk—Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The Company invests only in high-credit-quality instruments and maintains its cash equivalents and marketable securities in fixed-income securities. The Company places its cash primarily with domestic financial institutions that are federally insured within statutory limits.
For purposes of assessing concentration of credit risk and significant customers, a group of customers under common control or customers that are affiliates of each other are regarded as a single customer. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company did not have any customers that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had one customer that accounted for 21% of its net accounts receivable balance, and as of December 31, 2021, no customer accounted for more than 10% of its net accounts receivable balance.

 Income Taxes—The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining its income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received, as provided for under currently enacted tax law. A valuation allowance is established if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations, and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021 was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.

The Company regularly reviews its tax positions and benefits to be realized. The Company recognizes tax liabilities based upon its estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.

Stock-Based Compensation—The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock units and awards granted to employees, directors, and service providers based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of the shares to be issued under the employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model at the commencement of an offering period.

Stock-based compensation is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company also grants certain awards that have performance-based vesting conditions. Stock-based compensation expense for such awards is recognized using an accelerated attribution method from the time it is deemed probable that the vesting condition will be met through the time the service-based vesting condition has been achieved. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.

Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders—Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities. The Company considers all series of its redeemable convertible preferred stock to be participating securities as the holders of such stock have the right to receive nonforfeitable dividends on a pari passu basis in the event that a dividend is paid on common stock. Under the two-class method, the net loss attributable to common stockholders is not allocated to the redeemable convertible preferred stock as the preferred stockholders do not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents to the extent they are dilutive. For purposes of this calculation, redeemable convertible preferred stock, common stock options, restricted stock units, ESPP, early exercised common stock options, and common stock warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as their effect is anti-dilutive for the period presented.

Comprehensive Loss—Comprehensive loss is composed of two components: net loss and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of stockholders’ equity (deficit) but are excluded from net loss.

Research and Development—Expenditures for research and development of the Company’s technology and non-refundable contributions to the development of partner content are expensed when incurred unless they qualify as internal-use software development costs. Research and development costs consist principally of personnel costs, consulting services, content development contributions, and allocated facilities costs.

Advertising Costs—Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in sales and marketing expense. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, these costs were $11,566, $21,005 and $28,740, respectively.

Foreign Currency—The majority of the Company’s sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, the functional currency of the Company’s international subsidiaries is U.S. dollars. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material for any periods presented.
 New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted
The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that it (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, the consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
The JOBS Act does not preclude an emerging growth company from early adopting new or revised accounting standards. The Company early adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842), effective January 1, 2020, ASU 2018-15, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, effective July 1, 2021. The Company expects to use the extended transition period for any other new or revised accounting standards during the period for which the Company remains an emerging growth company.
 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. This update requires capitalization of the implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. Further, the standard also requires the Company to amortize the capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement over the term of the hosting arrangement. This update is effective for the Company for the annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2021 and interim periods within the annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2018-15 on July 1, 2021 on a prospective basis for implementation costs incurred after January 1, 2021. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. This new guidance is effective for the Company in 2023 and interim periods within that year, and early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance upon issuance to all business combinations that occur on or after the date of adoption. The adoption had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as there were no acquisitions accounted for as business combinations during the year ended December 31, 2021.
New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the guidance in Topic 740 related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill and the allocation of consolidated income taxes to separate financial statements of entities not subject to income tax. ASU 2019-12 will be effective for the Company in 2022. Upon adoption, the Company must apply certain aspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented while other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company does not expect a material impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, which provides new authoritative guidance with respect to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. This update changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments by introducing a current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model. The CECL model is a more forward-looking approach based on expected losses rather than incurred losses, requiring entities to estimate and record losses expected over the remaining contractual life of an asset. The guidance will be effective for the Company in 2023 and early adoption beginning in 2019 is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact from the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets where the recoverability of the assets is uncertain. The determination to provide a valuation allowance is dependent upon the assessment of whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Based on the weight of the available evidence, which includes the Company’s historical operating losses, lack of taxable income, and the accumulated deficit, the Company has provided for a full valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. The Company increased the valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 by $22,553 and $67,703, respectively.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $518,200 and $158,449, respectively, and U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $15,436 and $9,894, respectively. If not utilized, certain of the federal and state net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in 2030, while the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in 2033. State research and development tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely.

The Company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryovers may be subject to annual limitations of usage, as promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service and similar state provisions, due to ownership changes that may have occurred in the past. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.

95
 The federal net operating loss carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite carryforward period and are subject to an 80% deduction limitation based upon taxable income prior to net operating loss deduction. Of the total federal net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2021, $367,261 are carried forward indefinitely, but are limited to 80% of taxable income. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was enacted and signed into U.S. law to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses facing economic hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in tax laws or rates are accounted for in the period of enactment. The CARES Act temporarily removes the 80% taxable income limitation for tax years beginning before 2021. Furthermore, it allows for a five-year carryback of federal net operating loss arising in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Due to the Company’s loss position, the CARES act did not have a material impact to the Company’s financial statements.
  The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as certain U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation. Due to loss carryovers, the statutes of limitations remain open for tax years from since inception in the major jurisdictions that the Company is subject to tax. The tax return for the fiscal year ending 2020 is currently under examination in India. The Company is not under examination in any other jurisdictions.
  The Company did not provide deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes since the Company intends to permanently reinvest such earnings in respective foreign jurisdictions. The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial.

Uncertain Tax Positions—As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $12,539 of which $556 would impact the Company’s effective tax rate, if recognized. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:


 | Year Ended December 31, |

Gross unrecognized tax benefits - ending balance | $ | 14,099 | | $ | 7,477 | | $ | 12,539 | 


Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are accrued as part of income tax provision and were immaterial as of December 31, 2021. The Company is currently unaware of uncertain tax positions that could result in significant additional payments, accruals, or other material deviation in the next 12 months. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
7. REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock— Upon the closing of the Company’s IPO, all outstanding shares of its redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 75,305,400 shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. As of December 31, 2021, there were no shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.
As of December 31, 2020, redeemable convertible preferred stock consisted of the following:


 | | December 31, 2020 | 
SharesSeries | Issue Date | Authorized | | Outstanding | | Issue Price | | CarryingValue | | LiquidationAmount | 
A | December 2011 and June 2012 | | 23,023,168 | | 23,023,168 | | $ | 0.9628 | | $ | 22,127 | | $ | 22,167

 | | | 76,420,805 | | 75,305,400 | | | | $ | 462,293 | | $ | 464,036 | 


 The Company recorded the redeemable convertible preferred stock at fair value on the dates of issuance, net of issuance costs. The Company classified the redeemable convertible preferred stock outside of stockholders’ deficit because in the event of certain “liquidation events” that were not solely within its control (including merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets), the shares would become redeemable at the option of the holders. The Company did not adjust the carrying values of the redeemable convertible preferred stock to the deemed liquidation values of such shares since a liquidation event was not probable at the consolidated balance sheet date.

The significant rights and preferences of the outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock were as follows:

Dividends—Dividend holders of Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F redeemable convertible preferred stocks (“Series A,” “Series B,” “Series C,” “Series D,” “Series E,” and “Series F” and collectively, the “Preferred Stock”) were entitled to receive noncumulative dividends at an annual rate of $0.077, $0.3922, $0.4075, $0.60, $0.96 and $1.36 per share, respectively. Such dividends would be payable when declared by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”). No dividends would be payable on any common stock until dividends on Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F have been paid or declared by the Board of Directors. No dividends were declared or paid.

Redemption—While the Preferred Stock was not mandatorily redeemable, it was contingently redeemable in the event of certain “liquidation events” that were not solely within its control (including merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets).

Liquidation Preference—In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, holders of Series A were entitled to a liquidation preference of $0.9628 per share, plus any declared but unpaid dividends prior to, and in preference to, any distributions to the holders of common stock. Holders of Series B were entitled to a liquidation preference of $4.9029 per share, plus any declared but unpaid dividends prior to, and in preference to, any distributions to the holders of Series A and common stock. Holders of Series C were entitled to a liquidation preference of $5.0935 per share, plus any declared but unpaid dividends prior to, and in preference to, any distributions to the holders of Series A, Series B, and common stock. Holders of Series D were entitled to a liquidation preference of $7.50 per share, plus any declared but unpaid dividends prior to, and in preference to, any distributions to the holders of Series A, Series B, Series C, and common stock. Holders of Series E were entitled to a liquidation preference of $12.00 per share, plus any declared but unpaid dividends prior to, and in preference to, any distributions to the holders of Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, and common stock. Holders of Series F were entitled to a liquidation preference of $17.00 per share, plus any declared but unpaid dividends prior to, and in preference to, any distributions to the holders of Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E, and common stock. Any assets remaining following the distribution to the holders of Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E, and Series F would be distributed ratably among the holders of common stock.

Voting Rights—The holders of Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F were entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such redeemable convertible preferred stock was convertible. The holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, would be entitled to elect two members of the Board of Directors at any election of directors. The holders of common stock, voting as a single class, would be entitled to elect one member of the Board of Directors at any election of directors. The holders of the Preferred Stock and common stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, would be entitled to elect any remaining members of the Board of Directors at any election of directors.

Conversion—Each share of Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E, and Series F was convertible, at the option of the holder, into such number of fully paid nonassessable shares of common stock as was determined by dividing by the original issue price by the conversion price. The conversion price and resulting ratio was the same as the original issue price and ratio for each share of Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F. The conversion formula would be adjusted for such events as dilutive issuances, stock splits, or business combinations. Each share of Preferred Stock would automatically be converted into shares of common stock at the then-effective conversion price applicable to such share upon the earlier of (i) the date specified by written consent or agreement of holders of a majority of the shares of each series of Preferred Stock then outstanding (each voting separately as a series), or (ii) immediately upon the closing of the sale of the Company’s common stock in a firm commitment, underwritten public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), other than a registration relating solely to a transaction under Rule 145 under the Securities Act (or any successor thereto) or to an employee benefit plan of the Company, the public offering price of which results in aggregate proceeds to the Company (before payment of any underwriters’ discounts and expenses relating to the issuance) of at least $50,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each share of any series of Preferred Stock would automatically be converted into shares of common stock at the then-effective conversion price applicable to such share upon the date specified by written consent or agreement of holders of a majority of the shares of such series of Preferred Stock.



8. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)
Preferred Stock— In connection with the IPO, the Company authorized the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $0.00001 per share, with rights and preferences, including voting rights, to be designated from time to time by the board of directors. As of December 31, 2021, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.
Common Stock Warrants— In June 2012, the Company issued a warrant in connection with an educator partner agreement to purchase up to 571,250 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.20 per share. These warrants expire on the earlier of (i) June 2020, (ii) the sale of substantially all of the Company’s securities, or (iii) 60 days after the termination of the educator partner agreement. The vesting schedule of the warrants was based on attainment of certain customer course completion metrics for the partner’s content through June 2017.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company believed that 190,930 of these warrants were vested and exercisable per the terms of the educator partner agreement. In June 2020, the educator partner cash exercised the 190,930 warrants and attempted to net exercise 379,070 of the warrants. The Company and the educator partner entered dispute resolution procedures to resolve the dispute regarding the vesting of the 379,070 net exercised warrants. In December 2020, the dispute was resolved by both parties. The Company issued 187,305 fully vested shares of common stock to the educator partner and the educator partner entered into a contract amendment that expanded the extent of its content hosted on the Company’s platform. The Company did not record a charge to the consolidated income statement as a result of the resolution of the dispute as the value assigned to the settlement element was zero. The Company concluded that there would be significant expected future benefit to be obtained from the expansion of the educator partner’s content on its platform, and recorded the fair value of common stock issued (which was less than the expected fair value of the educator partner’s content to be made available on the Company’s platform) in the amount of $3,956 as an intangible content asset as of December 31, 2020 to be amortized over the estimated useful life of 5 years. Amortization commenced on March 1, 2021 when the content was made available on the Company's platform.
Stock Incentive Plans—In 2013, the Company adopted the Coursera, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (“Stock Incentive Plan”) and in 2014, adopted the Coursera, Inc. 2014 Executive Stock Incentive Plan (together, the “Predecessor Plans”), pursuant to which the Company has granted a combination of incentive and nonstatutory stock options and restricted stock units (“RSU”s).
The Predecessor Plans were terminated in March 2021 in connection with the IPO but continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards granted pursuant to the Predecessor Plans. No further equity awards will be granted under the Predecessor Plans.
The Company adopted the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) and 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) in February 2021, which became effective on March 30, 2021 when the registration statement for the IPO was declared effective (collectively the 2021 Plan, the ESPP and the Predecessor Plans are referred to as the "Plans"). The 2021 Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, RSUs and other equity awards. Pursuant to the ESPP, participants may contribute up to 15 percent of their eligible compensation to purchase shares of common stock at 85 percent of the lower of the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of commencement of the applicable offering period or on the last day of each six-month purchase period. The offering periods start on the first trading day on or after May 11 and November 11 of each year, except for the first offering period, which commenced on the Company’s IPO effective date, or March 30, 2021, and ends on May 10, 2023.
As of December 31, 2021, 14,333,573 shares of the Company's common stock, plus certain automatic annual increases in the number of shares of the Company's common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2021 Plan, and any shares subject to outstanding awards under the Predecessor Plans after the effective date of the 2021 Plan that are subsequently (i) forfeited or terminated, (ii) not issued because such award is settled in cash, or (iii) withheld or reacquired to satisfy the applicable exercise, strike, or purchase price, or a tax withholding obligation, were reserved for future issuance under the 2021 Plan. As of January 1, 2022, an additional 7,095,302 shares of common stock became available for future grants under the 2021 Plan.
As of December 31, 2021, 2,571,952 shares of the Company's common stock, plus certain automatic annual increases in the number of shares of the Company's common stock, were reserved for issuance under the ESPP. As of January 1, 2022, an additional 1,419,060 shares of common stock became available for future issuance under the ESPP pursuant to the provisions thereof that automatically increase the share reserve under such plan each year.
Stock Options—The Company may grant options at prices not less than the fair market value at the date of grant. These options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. Incentive stock options and nonstatutory options generally vest ratably over a four-year service period.
 Stock option activity under the Plans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 was as follows:

Options vested—December 31, 2021 | | 13,931,506 | | | $ | 3.48 | | 5.91 | $ | 292,064


Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the options and the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock as determined by the Board of Directors. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was $15,788, $50,286, and $296,635 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 was $2.69, $5.66, and $16.23, respectively. 
RSUs—During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company began granting RSUs to its employees and directors. RSUs granted prior to the IPO had service-based and performance-based vesting conditions, both of which must be satisfied in order for RSUs to vest. The service-based vesting condition for these awards is typically satisfied over four years with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied on the earlier of (i) a change in control event or (ii) the first sale of the Company’s common stock pursuant to an initial public offering. Both events were not deemed probable until consummated. Upon the first sale of the Company’s common stock pursuant to its IPO on April 5, 2021, the performance-based vesting condition was satisfied, and therefore, the Company recognized cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $16,803 using the accelerated attribution method for the portion of the awards for which the service-based vesting condition had been satisfied. RSUs granted after the IPO do not contain the performance-based vesting condition described above, and the related stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
RSU activity during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 was as follows:
   
 | Number ofShares | | | Weighted-AverageGrantFairValue | | | AggregateIntrinsicValue

Unvested balance—December 31, 2021 | | 7,387,288 | | | $ | 29.68 | | $ | 180,545


The aggregate grant-date fair value of RSUs that vested was zero for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and $18,767 for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Stock-Based Compensation Expense—The Company records stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value as determined on the grant date. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options and shares of common stock to be issued under the ESPP utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Key assumptions of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected term and expected dividends. The Company recognizes such compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period for each award. The fair value of restricted stock awards equals the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. These amounts are estimates and, thus, may not be reflective of actual future results, nor amounts ultimately realized by recipients of these grants.

A summary of the weighted-average assumptions the Company utilized to record compensation expenses for stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 is as follows:


 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2019 | | | 2020 | | | 2021
Fair value of common stock | $ | 5.70 | | | $ | 10.30 | | $ | 29.99 | 
Risk-free interest rate | | 1.8 | % | | | 0.6 | % | | 1.3 | %
Expected term (in years) | | 6.1 | | | | 6.1 | | | 6.2 | 
Expected volatility | | 46.8 | % | | | 50.3 | % | | 57.1 | %
Dividend yield | | — | % | | | — | % | | — | %


The following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model:


 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 
Risk-free interest rate | 0.03%-0.51% 
Expected term (in years) | 0.49-2.03 
Expected volatility | 48.3%-61.9% 
Dividend yield | —% 


The Company determines valuation assumptions as follows:

Fair Value of Common Stock— Prior to the IPO, the fair value was determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors considers numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of the Company’s common stock at each meeting in which awards are approved. The factors considered include, but are not limited to: (i) the results of contemporaneous independent third-party valuations of the Company’s common stock; (ii) the prices, rights, preferences, and privileges of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of its common stock; (iii) the lack of marketability of the Company’s common stock; (iv) actual operating and financial results; (v) current business conditions and projections; (vi) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of the Company, given prevailing market conditions; and (vii) precedent transactions involving the Company’s shares. Subsequent to the IPO, the fair value of the Company's common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of its common stock, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Expected Term—The expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. For option grants considered to be “plain vanilla,” the Company determined the expected term using the simplified method. The simplified method deems the term to be the average of the time to vesting and the contractual life of the options. For ESPP, the expected term represents the term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date.

Risk-Free Interest Rate—The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the option or ESPP share.

Expected Volatility—Since the Company does not have a sufficient trading history of its common stock, the expected volatility was derived from the average historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies, within the Company’s industry, that it considers to be comparable to its business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants or ESPP shares.

Dividend Rate—The expected dividend was assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to do so.

Each of these inputs above is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine.
 
Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, is classified in the consolidated statements of operations as follows:
   
 | Year Ended December 31, |

As of December 31, 2021, there was a total of $50,414 unrecognized employee compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.19 years. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs was $158,875 which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.43 years. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to ESPP as of December 31, 2021 was $15,949, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.97 years.

Income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 were immaterial due to cumulative losses and valuation allowances. Income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $821.

Litigation—The Company continually evaluates uncertainties associated with litigation and records a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. If the Company determines that a loss is possible and a range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the range of the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in its legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, if any, and the matters and related ranges of possible losses disclosed, and makes adjustments and changes to its disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss, and such amounts could be material. For legal proceedings for which there is a reasonable possibility of loss (meaning those losses for which the likelihood is more than remote but less than probable), the Company has determined it does not have material exposure on an aggregate basis at this time.
Indemnifications—In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provides for the potential of general indemnification obligations. The Company’s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves future claims that may be made against the Company but have not yet been made. To date, the Company has not paid any material claims or has been required to defend any actions related to its indemnification obligations; however, the Company may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations. In addition, the Company has indemnification agreements with certain of its directors, executive officers, and other employees that require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service with the Company. The terms of such obligations may vary.
12. 401(k) PLAN
The Company has a 401(k) savings plan (the “401(k) Plan”) that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. The 401(k) Plan provides for a discretionary employer-matching contribution. The Company has made no matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

 13. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTION
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company entered into a content sourcing agreement with a related party in the normal course of business. Content fees earned by the related party during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 were $5,876, $6,171, and $6,558, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, outstanding educator partner payables related to this content sourcing agreement were $4,821 and $1,502, respectively.
14. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is its CODM. For the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance, the CODM examines three segments which are the Company’s three revenue sources: Consumer, Enterprise, and Degrees. This is also consistent with how the Company disaggregates revenue.

The Consumer segment targets individual learners seeking to obtain hands-on learning, gain valuable job skills, receive professional-level certifications, and otherwise increase their knowledge and advance their careers. The Enterprise segment is focused on helping businesses and government customers upskill and reskill their employees and citizens, respectively, and helping university customers deliver online courses to their students. The Degrees segment is engaged in partnering with universities to deliver fully online bachelor’s and master’s degrees. The CODM measures the performance of each segment primarily based on segment revenue and segment gross profit.

Segment gross profit, as presented below, is defined as segment revenue less certain costs of revenue which represent content costs paid to educator partners. Content costs only apply to the Consumer and Enterprise segments as there is no content cost attributable to the Degrees segment. Instead, in the Degrees segment, the Company earns a Degrees service fee based on a percentage of the total online student tuition collected by the university partner. Expenses other than content costs included in cost of revenue are not allocated to segments because they are managed at the consolidated corporate level. These unallocated costs include platform and support costs, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets and internal-use software. In addition, the Company does not allocate sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, and general and administrative expenses because the CODM does not include the information in his measurement of the performance of the operating segments. While the Company has expanded its customer segments from Consumer to Enterprise and to Degrees, the Company’s technical and operating platforms continue to support the entire Company.

The CODM does not use asset information by segments to assess performance and make decisions regarding allocation of resources, and the Company does not track its long-lived assets by segment. The geographic identification of these assets is set forth below.
