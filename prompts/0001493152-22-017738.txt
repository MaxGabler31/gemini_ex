ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
PetVivo Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “PetVivo,” “we” or “us) is an emerging biomedical device company focused on the manufacturing, commercialization and licensing of innovative medical devices and therapeutics for animals. The Company has a pipeline of seventeen products for the treatment of animals. A portfolio of nineteen patents protects the Company’s biomaterials, products, production processes and methods of use. The Company began commercialization of its lead product Spryng™ with OsteoCushion™ Technology, a veterinarian-administered, intraarticular injection for the management of lameness and other joint afflictions such as osteoarthritis in dogs and horses, in the second quarter of its fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
 
In August 2021, we received net proceeds of approximately $9.7 million in a registered public offering (“Public Offering”) of 2.5 million units at a public offering price of $4.50 per unit. Each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.625 per share. The shares of common stock and warrants were transferable separately immediately upon issuance. In connection with the Public Offering, the Company’s common stock and warrants were registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, LLC under the symbols “PETV” and “PETVW,” respectively
 
The Company was incorporated in March 2009 under Nevada law. The Company operates as one segment from its corporate headquarters in Edina, Minnesota. For further information, see Note 1, Description of the Business, in the note to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.
 
Business Description
 
The Company is primarily engaged in the business of commercializing and licensing products in the veterinary market to treat and/or manage afflictions of companion animals such as dogs and horses. Most of our technology was developed for human biomedical applications, and we intend to leverage the investments already expended in their development to commercialize treatments for pets in a capital and time-efficient way.

Many of the Company’s products are derived from proprietary biomaterials that simulate a body’s cellular tissue by virtue of their reliance upon natural protein and carbohydrate compositions which incorporate such “tissue building blocks” as collagen, elastin and heparin. Since these are naturally-occurring in the body, we believe they have an enhanced biocompatibility with living tissues compared to synthetic biomaterials such as those based upon alpha-hydroxy polymers (e.g PLA, PLGA and the like) and other “natural” biomaterials that may lack the multiple proteins incorporated into our biomaterials. These proprietary protein-based biomaterials appear to mimic the body’s tissue thus allowing integration and tissue repair in long-term implantation in certain applications.
 
Our initial product, Spryng™ is a veterinary medical device designed to help reinforce articular cartilage tissue for the management of lameness and other joint related afflictions, such as osteoarthritis, in companion animals. Spryng™ is an intra-articular injectible product of biocompatible and insoluble particles that are slippery, wet-permeable, durable and resilient to enhance the force cushioning function of the synovial fluid and cartilage. The particles mimic natural cartilage in composition, structure and hydration. Multiple joints can be treated simultaneously. Our particles are comprised of collagen, elastin and heparin, similar components found in natural cartilage. These particles show an effectiveness to reinforce and augment the cartilage, which enhances the functionality of the joint (e.g. provide cushion or shock-absorbing features to the joint and to provide joint lubricity).
 
Osteoarthritis, a common inflammatory joint disease in both dogs and horses, is a chronic, progressive, degenerative joint disease that is caused by a loss of synovial fluid and/or the deterioration of joint cartilage. Osteoarthritis affects approximately 14 million dogs and 1 million horses in the $11 billion companion animal veterinary care and product sales market.
 
Despite the market size, veterinary clinics and hospitals have very few treatments and/or drugs for use in treating osteoarthritis in dogs, horses and other pets. As there is no cure for osteoarthritis, current solutions treat symptoms, but do not manage the cause. The current treatment for osteoarthritis in dogs generally consists of the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (or “NSAIDs”) which are approved to alleviate pain and inflammation but present the potential for side effects relating to gastrointestinal, kidney and liver damage and do not halt or slow joint degeneration. The Company offers an alternative to traditional treatments that only address the symptoms of the affliction. Spryng™ with OsteoCushion™ technology addresses the affliction, loss of synovial fluid and/or the deterioration of joint cartilage, rather than treating just the symptoms and, to the best our knowledge, has elicited minimal adverse side effects in dogs and horses. Spryng™-treated dogs and horses have shown an increase in activity even after they no longer are receiving pain medication or other treatments. Other treatments for osteoarthritis include steroid and/or hyaluronic acid injections, which are used for treating pain, inflammation and/or joint lubrication, but can be slow acting and/or short lasting.
 
We believe Spryng™ is an optimal solution to safely improve joint function in animals for several reasons:
 

● | Spryng™ addresses the underlying problems which relate to deterioration of cartilage causing bones to contact each other and a lack of synovial fluid. Spryng™ provides a biocompatible lubricious cushion to the joint, which establishes a barrier between the bones, thereby protecting the remaining cartilage and bone. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Spryng™ is easily administered with the standard intra-articular injection technique. Multiple joints can be treated simultaneously. 
● | Case studies indicate many dogs and horses have long-lasting multi-month improvement in lameness after having been treated with Spryng™. 
● | After receiving a Spryng™ injection, many canines are able to discontinue the use of NSAID’s, eliminating the risk of negative side effects. 
● | Spryng™ is an effective and economical solution for treating osteoarthritis. A single injection of Spryng™ is approximately $600 to $900 per joint and typically lasts for at least 12 months. 

 
Historically, drug sales represent up to 30% of revenues at a typical veterinary practice (Veterinary Practice News). Revenues and margins at veterinary practices are being eroded because online, big-box and traditional pharmacies have recently started filling veterinary prescriptions. Veterinary practices are looking for ways to replace lost prescription revenues with safe and effective products. Spryng™ is a veterinarian-administered medical device that should expand practice revenues and margins. We believe that the increased revenues and margins provided by Spryng™ will accelerate its adoption rate and propel it forward as the standard of care for canine and equine lameness related to or due to synovial joint issues.

Spryng™ is classified as a veterinary medical device under the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) rules and pre-market approval is not required by the FDA. Spryng™ completed a safety and efficacy study in rabbits in 2007. Since that time, more than 800 horses and dogs have been treated with Spryng™. We entered into a clinical trial services agreement with Colorado State University on November 5, 2020. We expect this university clinical study to be completed in November 2023. Additionally, the Company successfully completed an equine tolerance study in March 2022 and began a canine clinical study with Ethos Veterinary Health in May of 2022 with anticipated completion in fiscal 2023. We anticipate these and other studies that we plan to initiate will be primarily used to expand our distribution outlets since the large international and national distributors generally require a third-party university study and other third-party studies prior to including a product in their catalog of products.
 
We commenced sales of Spryng™ in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and plan to increase our commercialization efforts of Spryng™ in the United States through the use of sales reps, clinical studies and market awareness to educate and inform key opinion leaders on the benefits of Spryng™. We plan to support our commercialization efforts with the use of social media and other methods to educate and inform key opinion leaders and decision makers at the top distributors and high prescriber veterinarians for companion animals of the availability and benefits of Spryng™.
 
We have established an ISO 7 certified clean room manufacturing facility located in our Minneapolis facility using a patented and scalable self-assembly production process, which reduces the infrastructure requirements and manufacturing risks to deliver a consistent, high-quality product while being responsive to volume requirements. We recently began manufacturing commercial quantities and anticipate our ISO 7 certified facility will be able to handle projected production in units for at least the next five years.
 
We also have a pipeline which includes 17 therapeutic devices for both veterinary and human clinical applications. Some such devices may be regulated by the FDA or other equivalent regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”). We anticipate growing our product pipeline through the acquisition or in-licensing of additional proprietary products from human medical device companies specifically for use in pets. In addition to commercializing our own products in strategic market sectors and in view of the Company’s vast proprietary product pipeline, the Company may establish strategic out-licensing partnerships to provide secondary revenues.
 
Product Pipeline

Below is a listing of applications of our technology that we plan to commercialize or out-license to strategic partners:
 
Dermal Filler
 
Our biomaterials are constructed from purified water, protein, and carbohydrate, tailored to simulate different body tissues that biologically integrate (bio-integration). Our biomaterials can be manufactured and used as a dermal filler for wrinkle treatment by injection. These formed, gel particles fill, integrate and rejuvenate dermal skin tissue to remove the wrinkle. This product was taken through an FDA clinical trial under the name CosmetaLife®, see the results here: www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00414544).
Cardiovascular Devices
 
Our blood-compatible biomaterial, which allows blood contact and bio-integrative processes to occur without clotting, platelet attachment, or thrombogenesis, is used to repair cardiovascular tissue. VasoGraft®, a blood vessel graft made from VasoCover™ material, is designed to mimic natural blood vessel tissue in almost every respect, including the components used.
Drug Delivery
 
Unique fabrication techniques allow us to homogeneously distribute drug in milligram to nanogram amounts, resulting in optimum performance and manufacturing capabilities for a variety of delivery methods, such as coatings, injectables, implantables or transmucosal delivery. The first planned transmucosal product has been optimized and tested with peptide drugs with better efficacy than oral dosing via swallowing.
Orthopedic Devices
 
Another of our materials can be used in a variety of shapes for orthopedic and dental applications. The first products, OrthoGelic™ and OrthoMetic™, will be aimed at difficult-to-heal, non-union broken bones, by using particles to fill the empty space. The orthopedic biomaterial, made to mimic the structural components of bone, can allow integration and healing to fill in the break and exclude non-bone tissue infiltration.
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property portfolio is comprised of patents, patent applications, trademarks and trade secrets. We have ten issued United States Patents. In addition to the United States patent portfolio we also have eight patents granted in key markets around the world including Canada, Australia and countries within the European Union.
 
We believe we have developed a broad and deep patent portfolio around our biomaterials and manufacturing processes in addition to the application of these biomaterials for use as medical devices, medical device coatings and pharmaceutical delivery devices. The Company secures other technological know-how by trade secret law and also possesses several trademarks that are either registered or protected pursuant to trademark common law.

8 Foreign Patents Granted & Allowed
 
7 Patent Apps Pending (US & Foreign)
 
To maximize the strength and value of our patent portfolio, many of the claims use the transitional term “comprising”, which is synonymous with “including,” This use of transitional language is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps. Our patents also include method claims covering many of the applications and uses of the biomaterials as medical devices and drug delivery systems. We believe our intellectual property portfolio strongly protects our proprietary technology, including the composition of raw elements used to produce our formulations, the fabricated biomaterials and their application in end products, thereby making our material and devices much more attractive to industry partners.
 
We will seek to protect our products and technologies through a combination of patents, regulatory exclusivity, and proprietary know-how. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current compounds and any future compounds developed. We also strenuously protect our proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements, trade secrets and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.
 
We depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, including those of our company, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which may not be patentable, and inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment of ownership to us the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
 
Companion Animal Market
 
Over the last several decades, we believe the animal health market and industry has a strong component in the overall U.S. economy and is more resistant to economic cycles. The veterinary sector is as an attractive area to participate in the growth of the broader healthcare industry without reimbursement risk. The American Pet Products Association (APPA) 2021-2022 National Pet Owners Survey indicates that $123.6 billion was spent on pets in the U. S. in 2021. Vet Care and product sales constitutes about $34.3 billion of the market. The growth in the U.S. companion animal market has been continuing to increase due to the increase in the number of pet-owning households.
 
The APPA 2021-2022 National Pet Owners Survey indicates U.S. pet ownership reached record levels in 2022. Specifically, 70% of all U.S. households owned a pet in 2022. That’s 90.5 million pet-owning households, up from 84.6 million in 2018. In 2022, dogs and cats were the most popular pet species, owned by 69% and 45% of U.S. households, respectively. APPA also reported that there were 69.0 million dogs and 45.3 million cats in the U.S. APPA reported that 3.5% of U.S. households owned horses in 2022. According to the American Horse Council, the total number of horses owned by U.S. households was 7.2 million.

Osteoarthritis Market
 
Osteoarthritis, the most common inflammatory joint disease in both dogs and horses, is a progressive condition that is caused by a deterioration of joint cartilage. Over time, the joint cartilage deterioration creates joint stiffness from mechanical stress resulting in inflammation, pain and loss of range of motion, which may be referred to as lameness. Osteoarthritis joint stiffness and lameness worsens with time from gradual cartilage degeneration and an ongoing loss of protective cushion and lubricity (i.e., loss of slippery padding). As there is no cure for osteoarthritis, the various treatment methods are focused on managing the related symptoms of pain and inflammation. Veterinarians recommend several treatments depending on the severity of the disease, including a combination of rest, weight loss, physical rehabilitation, and a regimen of pain and anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to alleviate the pain and inflammation caused by OA, but long-term NSAIDs cause gastric problems. Moreover, NSAIDs do not treat the cartilage degeneration issue to halt or slow progression of the OA condition.
 
The Morris Animal Foundation estimates that OA effects approximately 14 million adult dogs in the U.S. and owners consistently report it as a top concern.
 
Horse Osteoarthritis (Lameness)
 
Equine osteoarthritis is the most common cause of lameness in horses. Equine OA is expensive to manage, with estimated annual costs as high as $10,000-15,000 per horse to diagnose, treat, and medicate, researchers found in one study as referenced in the Horse – Equine Monthly.
 
As noted previously, the American Horse Council reported the total number of horses owned by U.S. households was 7.2 million. According to an annual National Equine Health Survey conducted in collaboration with the British Equine Veterinary Association in 2016, 26% of horses suffered from lameness. As referenced in the Horse – Equine Monthly (June 2020), studies show 60% of all lameness issues are related to OA. Based on the above assumptions we calculate that there are approximately 1.1 million horses suffering from OA.
 
Distribution
 
Most U.S. veterinarians buy a majority of their equipment and supplies from a preferred distributor. More than 75% of veterinarians name Covetrus North America/Butler Schein Animal Health, Inc., Patterson Veterinary, MWI, Midwest Veterinary Supply, Inc. or Victor Medical Company as their preferred distributor. Combined, these top-tier distributors sell more than 85%, by revenue, of the products sold to companion animal veterinarians in the U.S. Covetrus, Patterson and MWI are recognized by manufacturers, distributors and veterinarians as the pre-eminent national companion animal veterinary supply distributors in the US. There are no other distributors that provide equivalent levels of service to manufacturers and regularly visit veterinarians in as wide a geographic area as Covetrus, Patterson or MWI. Midwest and Victor are large, regional distributors. The above data in this paragraph was sourced from File No. 101 0023 at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
 
We plan to have our product distribution leverage the existing supply chain and veterinary clinic and clinician relationships already established by these large distributors. We intend to support and supplement this distribution channel with regional business development & training representatives. We plan to have our business development representatives provide product training to distribution representatives, veterinarians and other veterinary staff. In addition, we intend to have our representatives and veterinarian partners exhibit at key veterinary conferences as well as support ongoing case studies. All of these sales, distribution, marketing and education efforts will also be supported by both veterinarian and pet owner product education and treatment awareness campaigns that will be conducted utilizing a variety of digital media tools. The unique nature and the anticipated benefits provided by our Spryng™ product are expected to generate significant consumer response.
 
Particle Devices
 
Orthopedic Joint Treatments
 
Our lead product, Spryng™, is a treatment for joint pain, which is made of injected, protein-based, biocompatible particles. In vivo studies indicate that the biocompatible particle device can easily be combined with synovial fluid in a rabbit knee to form a joint cushion, buffering the adjacent bones/cartilage where no damage was caused to the cartilage from replacing the synovial fluid. The particles show an effectiveness to augment and reinforce the tissue, cartilage, ligaments and/or bone and/or enhance the functionality of the joint (e.g. reinforce deteriorated components present in the joint to provide cushion or shock-absorbing features to the joint and to provide joint lubricity).

We retained AppTec Laboratories, an independent research organization, to conduct a gel-particle rabbit study in New Zealand in 2007. In this study, six white rabbits (6) were injected in both stifle joints (knees) to fill but not extend the synovial space (~0.5 cc GDP/site). Rabbits were tested every other day for abnormal clinical signs including range of motion and joint observations until sacrifice. Behavioral testing revealed no abnormal scores for range of motion, withdrawal response, or joint observations (all animals were 100% normal). At one week and at four weeks the animals were sacrificed. AppTec pathologists evaluated knee joint histology. The reported cartilage surfaces of the femoral and tibia condyles and the menisci were grossly and histologically 100% normal for all animals and test sites. The test particles were found in all of the injection sites.
 
The test particle did not cause changes in the articular cartilage of the femur or tibia when injected into the stifle joint of rabbits. The test article and control rabbit knees were not different for either 1 or 4-week time points for all histological measurements. In conclusion, the particles do not cause inflammation or damage to knee joint and will stick to exposed tissues and biologically integrate with those tissues. The particles were not found to stick to articular cartilage in any sample.
 
Regenerative Characteristics
 
The particle devices for joint injections have been extensively studied for a broad range of applications including the treatment of wrinkles as dermal filler. Here is an overview of the pre-clinical and clinical studies completed for CosmetaLife, which is the name used for the particle device when it was used as a dermal filler.
 
CosmetaLife is an easy-to-inject, water-protein-based dermal filler that not only fills nasolabial wrinkle depressions but also helps rejuvenate the dermal tissues, counteracting damage that causes wrinkles. The dermal cells are attracted to the CosmetaLife gel-particles, attach to them, and then slowly replace them with natural dermal material (extracellular matrix). The natural biological replacement process of CosmetaLife to collagen is estimated to take 6-12 months. CosmetaLife clinical trial on nasolabial folds supports this estimate.
 
CosmetaLife injections allow the body to create more natural dermal structure in and around every particle. Enhancing the natural process of dermal tissue construction with CosmetaLife allows for long-term dermal contouring, corrections, and rejuvenation with little to no adverse side effects noted in clinical trials.
 
Particle Device Clinical Studies
 
The Company has conducted several biocompatibility animal studies. In the implantation study, no abnormal clinical signs were noted for any of the rabbits. The results of the sensitization study in guinea pigs showed a sensitization response equivalent to the negative controls.
 
A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) IDE approved pivotal human clinical trial began with CosmetaLife late in 2006. The clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, parallel assignment, multi-center comparison of the safety and efficacy of CosmetaLife versus Restylane® (Control) for the correction of nasolabial folds. One hundred seventy-one patients were skin tested and 145 were treated at six trial sites. The number of study exits after treatment totaled four subjects. This clinical trial was reported and published at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00414544).
 
The feedback from physician investigators was positive with respect to CosmetaLife injection qualities, cosmetic appearance, and its feel to the touch. During the first three to four months of the study, CosmetaLife showed no decrease in efficacy, as compared to Restylane that showed an 11 percent decrease in efficacy. The FDA/IDE approved human clinical trial for the CosmetaLife product through twelve months was found to be the same as compared to control hyaluronic acid product, Restylane (for each interval the consensus of the blinded subjects tested preferred CosmetaLife or showed no preference at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months).
 
We use existing, scalable processes to reduce the infrastructure requirements and manufacturing risks to deliver a consistent, high-quality product while being responsive to volume requirements. We are able to scale the manufacturing process having made batches in up to 2.0-kilogram quantities to near GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) standards.

Particles Safety Study
 
Patients injected with CosmetaLife were found to have no or mild inflammatory, irritation, or immunogenic responses. These results suggest the particles are biocompatible because it closely matches the skin structure, composition, and moisture content. The no-to-low immunogenic responses are attributed to the tight cross-linking of the CosmetaLife matrix, which prevents immunogenic progenitor cells from producing antibodies to the matrix.
 
In the clinical trial, the incidence of possible reaction to a skin test was 2.55 percent, with only one subject showing a reaction to a second test or 0.6%, (1 out of 171). We also have a study report by AppTec, Inc., our Contract Research Organization, that [CosmetaLife] did not produce an antibody response during the clinical trial further supporting our belief that it is safe to use.
 
CosmetaLife is composed of materials that approximately meet the Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) requirements of the FDA. CosmetaLife contains materials from certified bovine and porcine tissue sources that do not harbor prion disease or BSE. Additionally, steps in the manufacturing process have been validated for deactivating all viruses.
 
Extrusion force testing and the Clinical Trial usage both demonstrate the consistent and easy injection of CosmetaLife. Twenty-five month stability testing shows that CosmetaLife is stable at room temperature conditions. Moreover, CosmetaLife has been shown to be stable at 40 °C (104 °F) conditions for at least 3 months.
 
Competition
 
The development and commercialization of new animal health medicines is highly competitive, and we expect considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty animal health medicines companies. As a result, there are, and likely will continue to be, extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new animal health medicines. Our potential competitors include large animal health companies, such as Zoetis, Inc.; Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc.; Merial, the animal health division of Sanofi S.A.; Elanco, the animal health division of Eli Lilly and Company; Bayer Animal Health, the animal health division of Bayer AG; NAH, the animal health division of Novartis AG; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Virbac Group; Ceva Animal Health; Vetoquinol and Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC. We are also aware of several smaller early stage animal health companies, such as Kindred Bio, Aratana Therapeutics Inc. (recently acquired by Elanco), NextVet and VetDC that are developing products for use in the pet therapeutics market.
Regulation – Human and Veterinary Use
 
Our lead product, Spryng™ and a number of the medical devices that we may manufacture for veterinary applications and human applications, are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Medical devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device receives approval for commercial distribution.
 
In the EU, medical devices are required to comply with the Medical Devices Directive and obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark certification, granted following approval from an independent Notified Body, is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable European Medical Devices Directives. Distributors of medical devices may also be required to comply with other foreign regulations such as Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare approval in Japan. The time required to obtain these foreign approvals to market our products may be longer or shorter than that required in the U.S., and requirements for those approvals may differ from those required by the FDA. In Europe, our devices are classified as Class IIa or IIb, and will need to conform to the Medical Devices Directive.

In the U.S., specific permission from the FDA to distribute a new device is usually required (that is, other than in the case of very low risk devices), and we expect that some form of marketing authorization will be necessary for our devices. Marketing authorization is generally sought and obtained in one of two ways. The first process requires that a pre-market notification (510(k) Submission) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or “substantially equivalent” to, a legally-marketed device that is not subject to pre-market approval (“PMA”). A legally-marketed device is a device that (i) was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, (ii) has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or (iii) has been found to be substantially equivalent to another legally-marketed device following a 510(k) Submission. The legally-marketed device to which equivalence is drawn is known as the “predicate” device. Applicants must submit descriptive data and, when necessary, performance data to establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. In some instances, data from human clinical studies must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) Submission. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms with specific requirements in accordance with federal regulations including the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) and human subjects protections or “Good Clinical Practice” regulations. After the 510(k) application is submitted, the applicant cannot market the device unless FDA issues “510(k) clearance” deeming the device substantially equivalent. After an applicant has obtained clearance, the changes to existing devices covered by a 510(k) Submission which do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness can generally be made without additional 510(k) Submissions, but evaluation of whether a new 510(k) is needed is a complex regulatory issue, and changes must be evaluated on an ongoing basis to determine whether a proposed change triggers the need for a new 510(k), or even PMA. The 510(k) clearance pathway is not available for all devices: whether it is a suitable path to market depends on several factors, including regulatory classifications, the intended use of the device, and technical and risk-related issues for the device.
 
The second, more rigorous, process requires that an application for PMA be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use as manufactured. This approval process applies to most Class III devices. A PMA submission includes data regarding design, materials, bench and animal testing, and human clinical data for the medical device. Again, clinical trials are subject to extensive FDA regulation. Following completion of clinical trials and submission of a PMA, the FDA will authorize commercial distribution if it determines there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe and effective for its intended purpose. This determination is based on the benefit outweighing the risk for the population intended to be treated with the device. This process is much more detailed, time-consuming, and expensive than the 510(k) process. Also, FDA may impose a variety of conditions on the approval of a PMA.
 
Both before and after a device for the U.S. market is commercially released, we would have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We would also be subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the FDA and other U.S. regulatory bodies (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and various state Attorneys General) monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our products. Although physicians are permitted to use their medical judgment to employ medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we are prohibited from promoting products for such “off-label” uses and can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, including a hold on approving new devices until issues are resolved to its satisfaction, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the DOJ. Conduct giving rise to civil or criminal penalties may also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by our conduct.
 
The delivery of our devices in the U.S. market would be subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and comparable state agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care.

The process of obtaining clearance to market products is costly and time-consuming in virtually all of the major markets in which we expect to sell products and may delay the marketing and sale of our products. Countries around the world have recently adopted more stringent regulatory requirements, which are expected to add to the delays and uncertainties associated with new product releases, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those releases. No assurance can be given that any of our other medical devices will be approved on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Pertaining to our Spryng™ product (offered for veterinary use only), in the U.S., the FDA does not require submission of a 510(k), PMA, or any pre-market approval for devices used in veterinary medicine. Device manufacturers who exclusively manufacture or distribute veterinary devices are not required to register their establishments and list veterinary devices and are exempt from post-marketing reporting. The FDA does have regulatory oversight over veterinary devices and can take appropriate regulatory action if a veterinary device is misbranded or adulterated. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer and/or distributor of these articles to assure that these animal devices are safe, effective, and properly labeled.
 
Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated. Frequently, medical device companies may choose to seek and obtain regulatory approval of a device in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. given the differing regulatory requirements. However, this does not ensure approval of a device in the U.S.
 
Research and Development
 
The Company is currently pursuing advancements in the composition, methods of manufacture and use for its proprietary biomaterials. It is anticipated that within the next twelve months the Company will pursue additional third-party studies related to the use of Spryng™ for the treatment of osteoarthritis in canine and equine patients. The Company also anticipates that resources will be expended to advance and improve the manufacturing systems for Spryng™ that will increase product volume and overall efficiency. Finally, the Company anticipates that research and testing will be conducted in the next eighteen months involving the existing Spryng™ formulation and other variations to identify and determine the next commercial product(s) that may be administered to the digital cushion of horses for the treatment of navicular disease.
Employees and Human Capital
 
As of June 28, 2022, we had 15 employees. We also engage outside consultants to assist with research and development, clinical development and regulatory matters, investor relations, operations, and other functions from time to time.
 
The Company believes that its success depends on the ability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel. It also believes that the skills, experience, and industry knowledge of its employees significantly benefits its operations and performance. The Company believes that it offers competitive compensation and other means of attracting and retaining key personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
 
Insurance
 
We currently maintain a “life science” commercial insurance policy with coverage in the amount of $5 million for our products and operations. The policy has been designed for those engaged in the life science business. We may face claims in excess of the limits of such insurance. As well, claims made against us may fall outside of our coverage. The policy is a “claims made” policy. Thus, our coverage must be maintained at the time a claim is made for us to be entitled to seek coverage from the issuer of the policy for such claims.
