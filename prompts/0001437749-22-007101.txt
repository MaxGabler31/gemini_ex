Overview
 
Panbela is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing disruptive therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer. Our product candidate, SBP-101, is a proprietary polyamine analogue designed to induce polyamine metabolic inhibition (“PMI”), a metabolic pathway of critical importance in multiple tumor types. Many tumors require greatly elevated levels of polyamines to support their growth and survival. For example, of all the human tissues, the exocrine pancreas has the highest level of native spermidine making pancreatic cancer the logical focus for initial development. Panbela initially licensed SBP-101 from the University of Florida Research Foundation (“UFRF”) in 2011. University research laboratory studies at select dose levels have demonstrated that SBP-101 induces programmed cell death, or “apoptosis,” in the acinar and ductal cells of the pancreas by activation of caspase 3 and poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (“PARP”) cleavage. SBP-101 has been shown to be an effective tumor growth inhibitor in preclinical studies of human pancreatic cancer models, demonstrating potential superior and complementary activity to existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved chemotherapy agents. SBP-101 has demonstrated encouraging activity against primary and metastatic disease in clinical trials of patients with pancreatic cancer. The safety results and PMI profile demonstrated in our completed first-in-human safety study provide support for the current study of SBP-101 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients previously untreated for metastatic pancreatic cancer.
 
To facilitate and accelerate the development of this compound in the pancreatic cancer indication, we have also acquired data and materials related to this technology from other researchers. We believe that SBP-101, if successfully developed, may represent a novel approach that effectively treats patients with pancreatic cancer and could become a dominant product in that market. Only three first-line treatment combinations, a single maintenance treatment for a subset (3-7%) of patients, and one second-line drug have been approved by the FDA for pancreatic cancer in the last 25 years.

In August 2015, the FDA accepted our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for our SBP-101 product candidate.
 
We have completed an initial clinical trial of SBP-101 in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. This was a Phase I, first-in-human, dose-escalation, safety study. From January 2016 through September 2017, we enrolled twenty-nine patients into six cohorts, or groups, in the dose-escalation phase of the Phase I trial. No drug-related bone marrow toxicity or peripheral neuropathy was observed at any dose level. In addition to being evaluated for safety, 23 of the 29 patients were evaluable for preliminary signals of efficacy prior to or at the eight-week conclusion of their first cycle of treatment using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (“RECIST”), the currently accepted standard for evaluating change in the size of tumors. A summary of both the safety and preliminary signals of efficacy for this completed clinical trial is contained later in this document under Clinical Development – Pancreatic Cancer, Phase I Clinical Trial Design and Completion (SBP-101 Monotherapy).
 
In 2018 we began enrolling patients in our second clinical trial, a Phase Ia/Ib study of the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of SBP-101 administered in combination with two standard-of-care chemotherapy agents, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in 4 cohorts to evaluate the dosage level and schedule. An additional 25 subjects were enrolled in the expansion phase of the trial. After completion of enrollment in the expansion phase, some serious adverse events related to vision were reported. We withheld administration of our drug and continued all other trial activities, which constituted a partial clinical hold. As noted below, the Company agreed with the FDA to include in the design of all future studies the exclusion of patients with a history of retinopathy or risk of retinal detachment and scheduled ophthalmologic monitoring for all patients. After working with the FDA, the hold was lifted. Interim results from the completed trial were presented in a poster at the American Cancer Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference in June of 2021. Updated, but still not final results, were presented in a poster at the American Society of Clinical Oncology - GI conference (“ASCO-GI”) in January 2022. The final study report is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2022. Further details regarding the study design, safety and interim signals of efficacy are contained later in this document under Clinical Development – Pancreatic Cancer, Phase Ia/Ib Clinical Trial Design and Interim Results (First Line Combination Therapy).
 
The safety results and tumor growth inhibition demonstrated in our Phase Ia/b study provides support for the randomized study of SBP-101 initiated in January of 2022. The trial, referred to as the ASPIRE trial, is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients previously untreated for metastatic pancreatic cancer. The trial will be conducted globally at approximately 60 sites in the United States, Europe and Australia. Further details regarding the study design and anticipated timing are contained later in this document under Clinical Development – Pancreatic Cancer, Phase II/III Clinical Trial design and anticipated timing (ASPIRE trial).
 
Recently the Company announced that SBP-101 has demonstrated positive preclinical data supporting the activity of SBP-101 in ovarian cancer cell lines. The Company is currently evaluating a full development plan for SBP-101 in ovarian cancer.

Pancreatic Cancer
 
Pancreatic cancer afflicts approximately 140,000 people in Europe (GLOBOCAN 2021, Global Cancer Observatory/World Health Organization), approximately 60,000 people in the United States annually (https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html), and 293,000 people worldwide – excluding Europe and United States (GLOBOCAN 2021). It has been identified as the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in Europe (GLOBOCAN 2021) and the third leading cause of death from cancer in the United States (SEER Cancer Statistics Factsheets 2021). On average Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (“PDA”) represents approximately 95% of all pancreatic cancers diagnosed in given calendar year. Considering that the median overall survival for previously untreated patients with good performance status is between 8.5 months (Von Hoff 2013) and 11.1 months (Conroy 2011) with the two most commonly available treatment regimens, effective treatment for PDA has remained a major unmet medical need.
 
Pancreatic cancer is generally not diagnosed early because the initial clinical signs and symptoms are vague and non-specific. The most common presenting symptoms include weight loss, epigastric (upper central region of the abdomen) and/or back pain, and jaundice. The back pain is typically dull, constant, and of visceral origin radiating to the back, in contrast to the epigastric pain which is vague and intermittent. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and new onset diabetes (which can be an early signal) or glucose intolerance (Hidalgo 2010).
 
Surgery remains the only treatment option with curative intent, although only about 20% of patients are candidates for surgical resection at the time of the diagnosis. Patients who undergo radical surgery still have a limited survival rate, averaging 23 months (Macarulla T, et al Clin Transl Oncol 2017).
 
For the minority of patients who present with resectable disease, surgery is the treatment of choice. Depending on the location of the tumor the operative procedures may involve cephalic pancreatoduodenectomy, referred to as a “Whipple procedure” distal pancreatectomy or total pancreatectomy. Pancreatic enzyme deficiency and diabetes are frequent complications of both the disease and these surgical procedures. Up to 70% of patients with pancreatic cancer present with biliary obstruction that can be relieved by percutaneous or endoscopic stent placement. However, even if the tumor is fully resected, the outcome in patients with pancreatic cancer has been disappointing (Hidalgo 2010, Seufferlein 2012). Post-operative administration of chemotherapy improved progression-free and overall survival in three large randomized clinical trials (Hidalgo 2010), but median post-surgical survival in patients treated in all three trials was similar, only 20-22 months. Pre-operative (neo-adjuvant) chemotherapy is of increasing interest, with the goal of improved successful resections and long-term outcomes.
 
For patients who present with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease, which represent a majority of PDA patients, management options range from chemotherapy alone to combined forms of treatment with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. However, due to the increased toxicity of combined treatment, randomized trials of such combined regimens have had low enrollment, precluding a firm conclusion as to any advantage of adding radiation to chemotherapy (Hidalgo 2010).

Gemcitabine was the first chemotherapeutic agent approved for the treatment of patients with PDA in the modern regulatory era, providing a median survival duration of 5.65 months (Burris 1997). Gemcitabine monotherapy was the standard of care for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer until combination therapy with gemcitabine plus erlotinib (Tarceva®) was shown to increase median survival by two weeks. This modest benefit was tempered by a significant side effect profile and high cost, limiting its adoption as a standard treatment regimen. Subsequently, the multidrug chemotherapy combination FOLFIRINOX, was shown to provide a median survival benefit of 4.3 months (OS = 11.1 months) over gemcitabine alone (6.8 months), but its significant side effect profile limits the regimen to select patients with a good performance status and often requires supplementation with WBC growth factor therapy. Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) received marketing authorization for use in combination with gemcitabine (FDA approved 2013) after showing an increase in overall survival of seven weeks compared to gemcitabine alone (Von Hoff 2013). Thus, combination therapies have demonstrated a modest survival benefit compared to gemcitabine alone as summarized in the table below (Thota 2014).

Other drugs are currently under investigation, but none have received marketing authorization as a first-line treatment of PDA since the approval of Abraxane. Lynparza®, (olaparib) was approved in December 2019 for maintenance therapy of patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma whose disease has not progressed on at least 16 weeks of a first-line platinum-and chemotherapy regimen.
Ovarian Cancer
 
Worldwide Ovarian Cancer has annual incidence of approximately 314,000 and annual deaths of approximately 207,000 (Globocan 2020). In the United States Ovarian represents approximately 1% of all new cancer cases at approximately 21,000 and the five year survival rate for metastatic disease is approximately 29% (SEER fact sheet Ovarian 2022). According to the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.
 
Nearly 70 % of the patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage due to the failure of screening methods for detecting early-stage disease (Giornelli. 2016; Partridge et al. 2009; Bast et al. 2007; Gohagan et al. 2000; Chudecka-Głaz 2015). Thus, most patients will relapse within the first 2 years after diagnosis, even after an optimal primary cytoreductive surgery and six cycles of the standard adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel.
 
    4 

  

The second line chemotherapy depends mainly on the disease-free interval (“DFI”) (time between completion of first line chemotherapy and clinical relapse); or progression-free interval (“PFI”) (time between the last chemotherapy given for relapsed disease and progression). There are three classifications: Platinum-refractory/resistant with relapse during platinum treatment (refractory) or with a DFI/PFI <6 months (resistant), Platinum-sensitive relapse occurring >12 m of last platinum-based chemotherapy, or partially sensitive to platinum with disease-free survival (“DFS”)/ progression free survival (“PFS”) between 6 and 12 months from the last platinum-based chemotherapy.
 
According to Pignata et al. 2017, in platinum-sensitive patients, treatment with platinum-based combinations is associated with a PFS advantage compared with single agents or non-platinum combinations. For patients with partially sensitive relapse (PFI between 6 and 12 months), two options are available: platinum doublets or non-platinum therapy (single agent or combination). Last, patients with resistant or refractory relapse (PFI < 6 months) disease there are few options. For these patients, monotherapy with a non-platinum drug or participation in clinical trials is indicated.
 
Proprietary Technology
 
Function and Characteristics of Polyamines
 
Polyamines are metabolically distinct entities within human cells that bind to and facilitate DNA replication, RNA transcription and processing, and protein (such as pancreatic enzymes) synthesis. Human cells contain three essential and naturally occurring polyamines – putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Polyamines perform many functions necessary for cellular proliferation, apoptosis and protein synthesis. The critical balance of polyamines within cells is maintained by several enzymes such as ornithine decarboxylase (“ODC”) and spermidine/spermine N1 acetyl transferase (“SSAT”). All of these homeostatic enzymes are short-lived, rapidly inducible intracellular proteins that serve to regulate native polyamine pools tightly and continuously. These enzymes constantly maintain polyamines within a very narrow range of concentration inside the cell.
 
Polyamine metabolism and cancer
 
Polyamines are required for cell proliferation. It is believed that many cancers, especially oncogene-driven cancers, might be sensitive to interference with polyamine metabolism. Consequently, with the loss of growth control in cancer cells, the transformed cells may be more sensitive to polyamine depletion than normal cells. Thus, the polyamine metabolic pathway is a rational target for therapeutic intervention (Casero 2018).
 
Polyamines are important modulators of the immune response, particularly in the tumor microenvironment where they are found in high concentrations. The inhibitory activity, most notably with spermine, of T-cells, monocytes, and macrophages, is an effective immune suppressant. This activity suggests that excess polyamines, especially spermine, may insulate the tumor microenvironment from immune cells. SBP-101 is a synthetic analogue of spermine, which is believed to reduce endogenous polyamine production. Therefore, there is a potential for SBP-101 to recondition the tumor microenvironment and act as a sensitizing agent for immune-oncology drugs such as checkpoint inhibitors.
 
Polyamine Analogue
 
Many tumors, including pancreatic cancer, display an increased uptake rate of polyamines. Polyamine analogues such as SBP-101 are structurally similar to naturally occurring polyamines and are recognized by the cell’s polyamine uptake system, allowing these compounds to gain ready entrance to the cell. We believe that pancreatic acinar cells, because of their extraordinary protein synthesis capacity, exhibit enhanced uptake of polyamines and polyamine analogues such as SBP-101. Because of this preferential uptake by pancreatic acinar cells, polyamine analogues such as SBP-101 disrupt the cell’s polyamine balance and biosynthetic network, and induce programmed cell death, or apoptosis, via processes including caspase 3 activation and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Proof of concept has been demonstrated in multiple human pancreatic cancer models, both in vivo and in vitro, that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma exhibits sensitivity to SBP-101.

SBP-101
 
SBP-101 is a proprietary polyamine analogue, which we believe accumulates in the exocrine pancreas acinar cells due to its unique chemical structure. SBP-101 was discovered and extensively studied by Professor Raymond J. Bergeron at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy.
 
As laboratory studies suggest, the primary mechanism of action for SBP-101 has been demonstrated to include the enhanced uptake of the compound in the exocrine pancreas, therefore, pancreatic cancer was logical for the initial development of this compound. Sufficiently high dosing in animal models leads to correspondingly depressed levels of native polyamines, with caspase 3 activation, PARP cleavage and apoptotic destruction (programmed cell death) of the exocrine pancreatic acinar and ductal cells without an inflammatory response. Importantly, pancreatic islet cells, which secrete insulin, are structurally and functionally dissimilar to acinar cells and are not impacted by SBP-101. In animal models at two independent laboratories, SBP-101 has demonstrated significant suppression of transplanted human pancreatic cancer cells, including metastatic pancreatic cancer growth. See “Proof of Principle” below.
 
We believe that SBP-101 exploits the natural affinity of the exocrine pancreas, the liver and kidney, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells while leaving the insulin-producing islet cells unharmed. Most current cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery are associated with significant side effects that further reduce the patient’s quality of life. However, based on data evaluated from clinical studies to date, we believe that the adverse effects of SBP-101 in causing bone marrow suppression or peripheral neuropathy do not overlap with or exacerbate those seen with typical chemotherapy options. The dose-limiting toxicities observed in cohort five of our first Phase I study, as noted below, were not observed at lower doses and are not expected to overlap with the adverse events of bone marrow suppression and peripheral neuropathy commonly associated with standard chemotherapy. The dose and dosing schedule evaluated in the expansion phase of the recently completed Phase Ia/Ib is below the maximum tolerable dose (‘MTD”) and at this dose level, neither the exocrine nor the endocrine human pancreas is expected to be affected by SBP-101, resulting in no treatment impact on pancreatic enzyme or insulin levels. This dose level and dosing schedule in the new ASPIRE trial will be the same as evaluated in the expansion phase of the 1a/Ib study.
 
Proof of Principle
 
SBP-101 has been tested and found effective in reducing pancreatic tumor growth in multiple separate in vivo models of human pancreatic cancer. SBP-101 was used to treat mice subcutaneously implanted with human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 tumor fragments. A dose-response for efficacy was demonstrated with a 26 mg/kg daily injection resulting in near complete suppression of the transplanted tumor.
 
A separate orthotopic xenograft study (direct implant of human tumor cells into the pancreas of the mouse) employed a particularly aggressive human pancreatic cancer cell line, L3.6pl, that is known to metastasize from the pancreas to the liver and the peritoneum in mice. Mice implanted with L3.6pl were treated with SBP-101 and the results were compared with saline-treated control mice, with mice treated with gemcitabine alone (Gemzar®, the then current “gold standard” treatment), and the combination of both drugs. SBP-101 significantly reduced tumor volume compared to gemcitabine alone and the control group, but the combination of SBP-101 and gemcitabine was significantly better than gemcitabine alone as shown in Figure 1.

The potential for SBP-101 as an effective therapy for pancreatic cancer has been demonstrated in vivo by separate investigators, in different human pancreatic cancer cell lines and in three different animal models, using SBP-101 synthesized by two different routes, confirming nearly equal, and effective, murine doses of 25 and 26 mg/kg, respectively.
 
Additionally, when compared in vitro to existing therapies, SBP-101 produced superior results in suppressing growth of pancreatic cancer cells.

Development Plan for SBP-101 
 
Development of SBP-101 for the pancreatic cancer indication has included a pre-clinical and a clinical phase. The pre-clinical phase, which was substantially completed during 2015, consisted of four primary components: chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”), preclinical (laboratory and animal) pharmacology studies, preclinical toxicology studies, and regulatory submissions in Australia and the United States. In Australia, a Human Research Ethics Committee (“HREC”) application was submitted with subsequent Clinical Trial Notification (“CTN”) to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”). Preceding the Australian initiative, a similar, but considerably more extensive, preclinical package has been submitted to and accepted by the FDA in support of an IND application. Our initial clinical trial in previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer was a Phase I, first-in-human, dose-escalation, safety study conducted at clinical sites in both Australia and the United States. We engaged expert clinicians who treat pancreatic cancer at major cancer treatment centers in Melbourne and Adelaide, Australia as well as the Mayo Clinic Scottsdale and HonorHealth in Scottsdale, Arizona. These Key Opinion Leaders, with proven performance in pancreatic cancer studies, enthusiastically agreed to participate as investigators for our Phase I First-in-Human study.
 
Enrollment in our initial Phase I safety trial of SBP-101 in previously treated pancreatic cancer patients commenced in January 2016 and was completed in September 2017. This study was a dose-escalation study with 8-week treatment/observation cycles at each dose level. Results from this trial are discussed in Clinical Development – Pancreatic Cancer, Phase I Clinical Trial Design and Completion (SBP-101 Monotherapy) below.
 
We completed enrollment of patients in our second clinical trial in December 2020. This second clinical trial was a Phase Ia/Ib study of the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of SBP-101 administered in combination with two standard-of-care chemotherapy agents, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in four cohorts of Phase Ia. Demonstration of adequate safety in Phase Ia allowed us to immediately begin enrollment in February 2020 in the Phase Ib exploration of efficacy. We completed enrollment of an additional 25 subjects in Phase Ib using the recommended dosage level and schedule determined in cohort 4 of Phase Ia. Safety and interim efficacy results from this trial are discussed in Clinical Development – Pancreatic Cancer, Phase Ia/Ib Clinical Trial Design and Interim Results (First Line Combination Therapy) below.
 
In January of 2022 we initiated our third clinical trial. This new trial is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study of safety and efficacy of SBP-101 administered in combination with two standard-of-care chemotherapy agents, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Trial design and expected timing are discussed in Clinical Development – Pancreatic Cancer, Phase II/III Clinical Trial design and anticipated timing (ASPIRE trial).
 
In addition, we are exploring SBP-101 for neoadjuvant treatment in appropriate pancreatic cancer patients. There is also preclinical data to suggest that SBP-101 may have potential therapeutic uses for cancers other than pancreatic. In February 2021, we entered into a research agreement with the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The collaboration has focused on the further development of Panbela’s investigative agent SBP-101, including activity in cell lines outside of pancreatic cancer, biomarkers informing diagnostics and potential combination with checkpoint inhibitors. In December of 2021, the Company announced positive preclinical data supporting the activity of SBP-101 in ovarian cancer cell lines. Further data resulting from the ongoing relationship with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is expected throughout 2022.
 
Preclinical Development
 
To enable IND and HREC/CTN submission and as part of our pharmacology work, we conducted plasma and urine assay development and validation in animals, in vitro metabolism studies in liver microsomes and hepatocytes, in vitro interaction studies with hepatic and renal transporters, a protein binding study, animal pharmacokinetic and metabolism/mass balance studies, and human plasma and urine assay development and validation. As a part of the pharmacology evaluation, we conducted an in vitro pharmacology screen profiling assay, a study in six human pancreatic cell lines, and studies in tumor xenograft models in mice using flank transplants of human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 tumor fragments and human pancreatic cancer BxPC-3 tumor fragments as well as human pancreatic cancer cells (L3.6pl) injected orthotopically into the pancreas of nude mice.
 
To meet regulatory requirements and to establish the safety profile of SBP-101, we conducted, in rodents and non-rodents, toxicology dose-ranging studies, IND-enabling GLP (good laboratory practice) toxicology studies, and genetic toxicology studies, including an Ames test. Exploratory studies in mice and rats and a GLP-compliant dog toxicology study have also been completed. The relationship between dose and exposure (pharmacokinetics) has been described for three animal species. We have also completed a preclinical Human Ether-a-go-go-related Gene (hERG) assay to detect any electrocardiographic QTc interval effects (IKr potassium ion channel testing).
 
In anticipation of the human potential for using SBP-101 in combination therapy with gemcitabine and/or nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®), we also conducted appropriate nonclinical studies which confirmed the potential value of such combinations, including assessing the comparative efficacy of SBP-101, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in various combinations as shown in Figure 2.

Note that maximum percent growth inhibition (mean ± SE) at 96 hours was observed with 10 µM SBP-101 alone and in combination with gemcitabine and/or nab-paclitaxel in six human pancreatic cancer cell lines.
 
We have met FDA-mandated CMC requirements with a combination of in-house expertise and contractual arrangements. Preparation of anticipated metabolites, impurities and an internal standard, as a prerequisite for analytical studies, were completed through Sponsored Research Agreements with the University of Florida and with Syngene International Ltd. (“Syngene”), a contract manufacturer. We have additional Service Agreements with Syngene for the manufacture and supply of Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”)-compliant SBP-101 active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and for the development of synthetic process improvements. As the result of efforts at Syngene to refine the synthetic process, a new shorter synthetic process has been developed on which a patent (US 11,098,005 B2) “METHODS FOR PRODUCING (65,155)-3,8,13,18-TETRAAZAICOSANE-6, 15-DIOL” issued on Aug. 24, 2021. Multiple lots of GMP-compliant API have been prepared by Syngene and released for conversion into supply dosage form. Multiple lots of investigational product (IP or clinical trial supply), together with matching placebo has been made and tested at CURIA formerly known as Albany Molecular Research Inc. (“AMRI”) in Burlington, MA.

Preparation of the SBP-101 IND for pancreatic cancer required collaboration by our manufacturing, preclinical toxicology, pharmacokinetic, and metabolism experts, our regulatory affairs project management, and our in-house clinical expertise. In August 2015, the FDA accepted our application and in January 2016 we commenced patient enrollment in our first Phase I clinical trial, which was a safety and tolerability study in patients with previously treated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Phase I Clinical Trial Design and Completion (SBP-101 Monotherapy)
 
Our initial Phase I study in patients with pancreatic cancer commenced the enrollment of patients in January 2016 and enrollment was completed in September 2017. This study was a dose-escalation study with 8-week cycles of treatment/observation at each dose level.
 
A favorable characteristic of the pancreatic action of SBP-101 is the lack of an effect on the normal insulin-producing islet cells, and no apparent effect on human exocrine pancreatic function at current or anticipated dose levels. Preservation of islet cell function predicted the absence of diabetes as a complication of SBP-101 therapy. It is important to note that diabetes is a common co-morbidity in patients with pancreatic cancer, but it has not appeared to be an adverse effect of treatment with SBP-101. No adverse effect on exocrine pancreatic enzyme production has been observed and would be mitigated by the observation that many patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma require pancreatic enzyme replacement as a feature of their underlying disease, a complication so common that pancreatic enzyme replacement with one of several commercially available products is typically covered by United States and Australian health care plans. Patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer are the populations most often treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement.
 
Patients in our Phase I first-in-human trial underwent regular pancreatic and hepatic enzyme evaluation and obtained periodic chest and abdominal CT follow-up. Patients were also carefully monitored for clinical signs of GI adverse events, but no new onset of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was attributed to SBP-101 therapy.
 
In August 2015, the FDA accepted our IND application for our SBP-101 product candidate. We have completed an initial clinical trial of SBP-101 in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. This was a Phase I, first-in-human, dose-escalation, safety study. Between January 2016 and September 2017, we enrolled twenty-nine patients into six cohorts, or groups, in the dose-escalation phase of our Phase I trial. Twenty-four of the patients received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens. No drug-related serious adverse events occurred during the first four cohorts. In cohort five, serious adverse events (klebsiella sepsis with metabolic acidosis in one patient, renal and hepatic toxicity in one patient, and mesenteric vein thrombosis with metabolic acidosis in one patient) were observed in three of the ten patients, two of whom exhibited progressive disease at the end of their first cycle of treatment and were determined by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) to be DLTs. Consistent with the study protocol, the DSMB recommended continuation of the study by expansion of cohort 4, one level below that at which DLTs were observed. Four patients were enrolled in this expansion cohort. One patient developed focal pancreatitis at the site of the primary tumor after 2.3 months, but SBP-101 was considered well tolerated below dose level five. The most common drug related adverse events were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, injection site pain and abdominal pain, which were mostly mild, grades 1 or 2, and are symptoms common in patients with pancreatic cancer. No drug-related bone marrow toxicity or peripheral neuropathy was observed at any dose level.

In addition to being evaluated for safety, 23 of the 29 patients were evaluable for preliminary signals of efficacy prior to or at the eight-week conclusion of their first cycle of treatment using the RECIST, the current standard for evaluating changes in the size of tumors. Eight of the 23 patients (35%) had SD and 15 of 24 (65%) had PD. It should be noted that of the 15 patients with PD, six came from cohorts one and two and are considered to have received less than potentially therapeutic doses of SBP-101. We also noted that 28 of the 29 patients had follow-up blood tests measuring the Tumor Marker CA 19-9 associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Eleven of these patients (39%) had reductions in the CA 19-9 levels, as measured at least once after the baseline assessment. Seven of the remaining 17 patients who showed no reduction in CA 19-9 came from cohorts one and two.
 
By cohort, stable disease occurred in two patients in cohort 3, two patients in cohort 4 and four patients in cohort 5. The best response outcomes and best median survival were observed in the group of patients who received total cumulative doses of approximately 6 mg/kg (cohort three). Two of four patients (50%) showed stable Disease (“SD”) at week eight. Median survival in this group was 5.9 months, with two patients surviving 8 and 10 months, respectively. By total cumulative dose received, five of twelve patients (42%) who received total cumulative doses between 2.5 mg/kg and 8.0 mg/kg had reductions in the CA19-9 levels, as measured at least once after the baseline assessment. Nine of these patients (67%) exceeded three months of OS, three patients (25%) exceeded nine months of OS and two patients (17%) exceeded one year of OS and were still alive at the end of the study.

The absence of adverse events which could potentially overlap with adverse events typically observed in the use of conventional chemotherapeutic agents, supports the case for combination of SBP-101 with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, or even FOLFIRINOX.
Phase Ia/Ib Clinical Trial Design and Interim Results (First Line Combination Therapy)
 
Given the life-threatening nature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the limited efficacy of current treatment options, and the long history of failures in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma developmental therapeutics, we have evaluated SBP-101 expeditiously as noted below.

We completed enrollment of patients in our second clinical trial in December 2020. This second clinical trial was a Phase Ia/Ib study of the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of SBP-101 administered in combination with two standard-of-care chemotherapy agents, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The trial included six study sites; four in Australia and two in the United States. In the Phase Ia portion of this trial, we completed enrollment during the first quarter of 2020 of four cohorts with increased dosage levels of SBP-101 administered in the second and third cohorts; the fourth cohort evaluated an alternate dosing schedule. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in four cohorts of Phase Ia. The demonstration of adequate safety in Phase Ia allowed us to immediately begin enrollment in February 2020 in the Phase Ib exploration of efficacy. By December 2020, an additional 25 subjects in Phase Ib using the recommended dosage level and schedule determined in Phase Ia were enrolled.
 
After Phase Ib enrollment was completed, some patients in the trial were noted to have complaints of serious visual adverse effects. Visual changes were not seen in the SBP-101 monotherapy study. We consulted with our DSMB and halted the administration of SBP-101 while all other trial activities continued. In February of 2021, we also conferred with the FDA regarding our plan to hold dosing of SBP-101. This withholding constituted a “partial clinical hold.” In April of 2021, the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold. The Company agreed with the FDA to include in the design of all future studies the exclusion of patients with a history of retinopathy or risk of retinal detachment and scheduled ophthalmologic monitoring for all patients.
 

Interim results from the full study were presented in a poster in at American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal conference (“ASCO-GI”) in January of 2022.

PFS and OS includes 7 subjects from Cohort 2 as these subjects received the same dose albeit on a different schedule than the 30 subject in Cohorts 4 and Ib. PFS may have been negatively impacted by drug dosing interruptions to evaluate potential toxicity. Median overall survival in Cohort 4 + Phase IB is 12.0 months and is not yet final as of the January 2022 poster date. Two subjects in Cohort 2 are still alive at 29.3+ and 30.7+ months, respectively.
 
Phase II/III Clinical Trial design and anticipated timing (ASPIRE trial)
 
The Company announced that the ASPIRE trial, a randomized study of SBP-101 with Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel versus Gemcitabine, Nab-Paclitaxel and placebo, was initiated in January of 2022. The trial is in patients with first-line metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The trial is designed as a Phase II/III randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, with a primary endpoint of overall survival. The design includes a phase 2 portion for which a futility analysis after 104 progression free survival events will occur. If the futility analysis is favorable, the trial will be expanded to the phase 3 portion with a primary endpoint of overall survival. We are intending to conduct the ASPIRE trial at leading cancer centers in the United States, Europe and the Asia-Pacific Region. It is expected that there will be approximately 60 sites and we anticipate enrollment for the phase 2 portion to be completed in approximately 12 months.
 
If we can successfully complete all FDA recommended clinical studies, we intend to seek marketing authorization from the FDA, the EMA (European Union), Ministry of Health and Welfare (Japan) and TGA (Australia). The submission fees may be waived when SBP-101 has been designated an orphan drug in each geographic region, as described under “Orphan Drug Status.”
 
Total Development Costs
 
The development of SBP-101 involves a preclinical and a clinical development phase. We have completed our initial preclinical development work for pancreatic cancer as well as two Phase I clinical trials. The Phase II/III trial has just been initiated. Additional clinical trials will likely be required for FDA or other approvals in foreign jurisdictions if the results of the first-line clinical trial of our SBP-101 product candidate justify continued development. The cost and timing of additional clinical trials is highly dependent on the nature and size of the trials.
Orphan Drug Status
 
The Orphan Drug Act provides special status to drugs which are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, or that affect more than 200,000 persons but for which a manufacturer is not expected to recover the costs of developing and marketing such a drug. Orphan drug designation has the advantage of reducing drug development costs by: (i) streamlining the FDA’s approval process, (ii) providing tax breaks for expenses related to the drug development, (iii) allowing the orphan drug manufacturer to receive assistance from the FDA in funding the clinical testing necessary for approval of an orphan drug, and (iv) facilitating drug development efforts. More significantly, the orphan drug manufacturer’s ability to recover its investment in developing the drug is also greatly enhanced by the FDA granting the manufacturer seven years of exclusive US marketing rights upon approval. Designation of a product candidate as an orphan drug therefore may provide its sponsor with the opportunity to adopt a faster and less expensive pathway to commercializing its product. We obtained US Orphan Drug Status in 2014 and we intend to apply for Orphan Drug Status in Europe, Japan and Australia when we have additional clinical data.

Fast Track
 
In June 2020, we received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for development of SBP-101 for the treatment of first-line patients with metastatic PDA when administered in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. With the designation of Fast Track Designation, we may engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may review sections of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the Company provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Intellectual Property
 
As the result of efforts at our contract manufacturer Syngene International Ltd to refine the synthetic process, a new shorter synthetic process has been developed on which a patent (US 11,098,005 B2) “METHODS FOR PRODUCING (65,155)-3,8,13,18-TETRAAZAICOSANE-6, 15-DIOL” issued on Aug. 24, 2021 and was assigned to Panbela. The patent claims cover a novel process for the production of SBP-101 and reduces the number of synthetic steps from nineteen to six.
 
We are evaluating other opportunities to provide additional intellectual property.
 
Human Capital Management
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had six employees, four of which were full time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors, and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to motivate such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives and lead to the success of the Company and increase value to our stockholders.
 
We value diversity of backgrounds and perspectives in our workforce and our policy is that we do not discriminate based on race, religion, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, military and veteran status, sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic as established by federal, state or local laws.
 
We believe that operational responsibilities can be handled by our current employees, independent consultants and our global CRO. We have historically used the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services. We believe that this use of third-party service providers enhances our ability to minimize general and administrative expenses. We intend to periodically evaluate our staffing and talent requirements and expect to add employees if that becomes a more appropriate resourcing alternative.

Competition
 
The development and commercialization of new products to treat cancer is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
 
We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue approaches to targeting molecular alterations and signaling pathways associated with cancer. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, less costly, or possessing better safety profiles than our products, and these competitors may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
 
In addition, we may need to develop our product candidates in collaboration with diagnostic companies, and we will face competition from other companies in establishing these collaborations. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may be approved as companion treatments and not be competitive with current therapies. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidate progresses through clinical development.
 
SBP-101
 
Commercialization
 
We have not established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure nor have we devoted significant management resources to planning such an infrastructure because our lead product candidate is still in early clinical development. We currently anticipate that we will partner with a larger pharmaceutical organization having the expertise and capacity to perform these functions.
 
    14 

  

Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize. If needed, we intend to engage, by entering into a supply agreement or through another arrangement, third party manufacturers to provide us with additional SBP-101 clinical supply. We identified and qualified manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services for our initial product candidate prior to our submission of an NDA to the FDA and expect to continue utilizing this approach for any future product candidates.
Material Agreements
 
The Standard Exclusive License Agreement (“License Agreement”) dated December 22, 2011, between us and UFRF grants us an exclusive license to the proprietary technology covered by issued United States Patents Nos. US 5,962,533, which expired in February 2016, and US 6,160,022 which expired in July 2020 and Know-How as defined by the License Agreement, with reservations by UFRF for academic or government uses. Under this agreement, we had agreed to pay various royalties, expenses and milestone payments to UFRF.
 
The License Agreement was amended in December 2016 (“First Amendment”) and again in October 2019 (“Second Amendment”).
 
Under the Second Amendment all minimum royalty payments and milestone payments defined in the License Agreement were eliminated. In addition, the period of payment royalties was changed to be the shorter of (i) ten (10) years from first commercial sale or (ii) the period of market exclusivity on a country-by-country basis. UFRF may also terminate this license for standard and similar causes such as material breach of the agreement, bankruptcy, failure to pay royalties and other customary conditions. The agreement allows for UFRF to terminate if the first commercial sale is not made by December 31, 2025.
 
The foregoing description of the material terms of the License Agreement, as amended, is qualified by the full text of the License Agreement , and the Second Amendment, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Government Regulation 
 
FDA Approval Process 
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable US requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including the Investigator’s Brochure, information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, potential perceived side effects and risks, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
    15 

  

A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on US patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”) for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects/patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase II evaluations, pivotal, or Phase III trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In many cases the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase III trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. After an NDA is approved, a Phase IV trial may be undertaken to evaluate safety over a long period of time, quality of life or cost effectiveness.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, toxicology, manufacture, controls and any proposed labeling. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial, and the fees are typically increased annually.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs to encourage timeliness. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within twelve months from submission; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed within eight months from submission. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. If priority review is achieved, the FDA’s goal is to act on the application within six months. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 
    16 

  

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”), a quality system regulating manufacturing, is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 
 
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are (1) intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or (2) condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 
Under the Fast Track program and FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase IV or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to priority review by FDA.
 
    17 

  

If a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may review sections of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation 
 
The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication, assuming that the same drug has not already been approved for the indication for which the sponsor is seeking orphan designation. If the same drug has already been approved for the indication for which the sponsor is seeking orphan designation, the sponsor must present a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority in order to obtain orphan designation. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the FDA discloses the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use.
 
Orphan designation may provide manufacturers with benefits such as research grants, tax credits, Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) application fee waivers and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity.
 
In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to 6 years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with FDA subjects’ entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 
Additional Regulations and Environmental Matters 
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, and our activities may implicate the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and similar state laws, each as amended.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. While we reasonably believe our practices to be in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, our practices may not in all cases meet all the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (as further discussed below).
 
    19 

  

The Civil Monetary Penalties statute authorizes the imposition of severe financial penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 
HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH) and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, other specified health care professionals and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians, other specified health care professionals and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other specified health care professionals and their immediate family members. Some states have analogous laws requiring manufacturers to report certain transfers of value to covered individuals and entities. To distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, privately managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. This is also true of Medicare reimbursement, where different vendors process payments, so that coverage by one vendor does not assure that all other vendors will provide coverage. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, the United States federal government position on matters related to drug pricing is evolving and uncertain, and any changes could have a material impact on drug pricing generally in the United States, including for our product candidates if approved.
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom also requires consideration of cost-benefit analysis. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
