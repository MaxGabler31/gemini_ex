ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
 
Real Brands Inc. (“RLBD”, “Real Brands”, or the “Company”) is a publicly traded, vertically integrated, early entrant (2017) in the hemp-derived cannabinol (“CBD”) market that specializes in hemp CBD oil/isolate extraction, wholesaling of CBD oils and isolate, manufacturing, production and sales of hemp-derived CBD consumer, celebrity brands, and white label products. Real Brands is listed in the Over the Counter Pink Sheets (“OTCQB”) under the symbol “RLBD”. 
 Real Brands completed a reverse merger to acquire Canadian American Standard Hemp Inc. (“CASH”) on October 26, 2020 (the “Merger”). Real Brands’ name and trading symbol were maintained, with CASH shareholders acquiring majority control of Real Brands. CASH continues to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Real Brands under the name CASH Inc. Following the Merger, Thomas Kidrin, CEO of CASH, was named Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Real Brands, replacing former Real Brands CEO Jerry Pearring.
Real Brands’ initial primary business has been pharmaceutical grade cannabinoid extraction of CBD isolate and distillate as well as terpenes and minor cannabinoids, wholesaling of CBD oils and isolate, proprietary formulation, production, and sales of hemp-derived consumer brands. The Company is extracting and refining essential oils and compounds of interest from certified hemp cultivars through the use of its proprietary processing technology and methodology. The unique methodology allows for full purification to >99% without the implementation of hazardous or environmentally impactful chemical compounds. 
 The Company has also made a strategic commitment to becoming a brand owner and has committed resources to developing proprietary branded product lines with novel formulations in order to distribute high-quality, low-cost hemp derived products such as topical creams and gels, cosmetics, tinctures, oils, capsules, vape cartridges, oral sprays and other products that contain hemp derivative distillate or isolate as well as other minor cannabinoids. 
 Recent developments

The Company purchased and renovated its own building and hemp processing facility at 12 Humbert St., in North Providence, RI. 
 Our new, state-of-the-art hemp processing facility is equipped with our proprietary Halo 5; Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) chromatography processing technology system (encompassing chemistry, mechanical engineering, and computer software) that produces a consistent 99.9% pure CBD distillate and isolate. The Halo 5’s SMB process is advantageous because it provides large quantities of highly purified material and precise pharmaceutical grade molecular separation at dramatically reduced costs. There is also in-house capacity for bottle filling and packaging and there is a 5,000 SQ space on the 2nd floor of the Plant where we could install a grow facility.  
 Our Technology
 
Our HALO.5 Simulated Moving Bed Chromatography System (SMB) is an integrated 6-column SMB system designed for isolation and purification of chemical compounds at a high rate of productivity as compared to single column batch chromatography. It has powerful simulation software (Optional Ypso-Facto Chromworks®) as well as an integrated DAD UV/VIS photometric detectors that allow for rapid and

accurate method development. All of this is combined with application support for specific applications such as cannabinoid isolation and mitigation. The HALO.5 is a powerful tool for rapid production of purified chemical compounds. We believe that through this device our products can be made more quickly, more purified, and less expensively than our competitors. 
 
The Company is extracting and refining essential oils and compounds of interest from certified hemp cultivars through the use of its proprietary processing technology and methodology as described below. Initial concrete oleo resin extracts are carried out within a closed loop multi-vessel, sanitary stainless-steel system. This system extracts the compounds of interest through a continuous flow of cryonic chilled food grade ethyl alcohol. All elements of the extraction process take place at or below ambient temperatures and pressures, mitigating any risk of vapor pressure buildup and allowing for selective efficient separation of all phytocompounds. All solvent movement is carried out with pneumatic fluid pumps, whose mechanical functions and electrical components are isolated in an adjacent control room. Solvent recovery is performed under deep vacuum at or below ambient temperature thus negating the use of any external heat source within the extraction process. Isolation and purification is then achieved through the use of a proprietary continuous flow, multicolumn, counter current chromatography system. As the entire process of extraction to isolation is carried out at or below ambient temperature and pressure, all phytochemicals are preserved in their natural state. Any risk of molecular isomerization or degradation is de minimis. The solvent system consists of food grade ethyl alcohol and distilled water. The unique methodology allows for full purification to >99% without the implementation of hazardous or environmentally impactful chemical compounds. 
 The Company believes its SMB Continues Flow Chromatography process is a highly engineered process for chromatographic separation. It is used to separate one chemical compound or one class of chemical compounds from one or more other chemical compounds to provide significant quantities of the purified or enriched material at a lower cost than could be obtained using simple (batch) chromatography. Standard batch processing is costly and requires constant monitoring. However, the Company utilizes high efficiency solvent recovery systems and continuous flow moving bed chromatography, keeping energy and overall operational costs very low. Running the Company’s entire self-contained process requires only two semi-skilled employees per shift. 
 Due in large part to the Company’s proprietary manufacturing process, the Company believes it is a very low-cost manufacturer that gives it a distinct advantage in the industry. This advantage is expected to translate over time into multiple strategic business opportunities and highlight the Company’s ability to become a large wholesaler of high-quality refined CBD. Also, this could allow the Company to become a critically important low-cost supply chain to distributors, while providing a strategic price protection to its branded product lines.

 Our Strategy
 We intend to grow our business by trying to engage in some or all of the following:
 
· | Launching multiple web-based platforms to educate and sell direct to consumers the Company’s owned brands that focus on CBD derived from hemp products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continuing to develop and expand our own proprietary branded retail line of products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Investing in other entities with hemp-based products we can supply our CBD distillate and isolate ingredients to that are deemed strategic, and/or add economies of scale.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursue acquisitions within our current core product offerings to extend our geographic reach and expand our product offerings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Licensing our products to create additional revenue streams.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | Joint venture, develop and market celebrity brand lines.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 The brand development strategy is to try to leverage existing Company resources into creating online sales, licensing opportunities and a distribution network for proprietary legal hemp and (eventually) cannabis brands, and other consumer brands. The Company hopes to acquire and/or develop brands that CBD and minor cannabinoids are complementary ingredients, and which are conducive to hemp derived infusion or micro encapsulation i.e., chocolates, cosmetics, edibles, drinks, sprays, tinctures, sub-lingual strips, cooking condiments, powders, Vapes, etc. 
 The Hemp Industry
 
Mainstream acceptance of CBD is expected to continue its general upward trend despite the market challenges and adjustments created by the Covid-19 Pandemic. Based upon the Brightfield Group’s publicly available market reports between 2018 and 2020, the Brightfield Group  had estimated the US CBD market in 2020 was projected to reach $4.7 billion in sales, with 14% growth from 2019 sales of $4.1 billion. (Lower than pre-Covid levels of $7 billion for 2020.) Actual 2020 Sales were $4.6 billion. According to the researchers, the U.S. hemp-derived CBD market will reach $5.3 billion in retail sales in 2021. This would imply 15% growth over 2020 sales of $4.6 billion.
In addition, based upon the publicly available market reports from the Brightfield Group , they expect sales to reach $16 billion by 2026, driven by accelerated growth of ingestibles (tinctures, capsules, drinks). New consumers will enter the market as prices continue to drop and access expands. Further online sales are expected to have surpassed $2 billion in 2021, accounting for 38% of the total American CBD market. This is down slightly from 42% in 2020, and management believes that this is a positive indication that consumers are starting to return to in-person retail shopping as COVID concerns abate. 
 The CBD market still exists in a regulatory gray area nearly 2.5 years after the 2018 Farm Bill went into effect. The delay has been particularly impactful for ingestible CBD products like edibles and tinctures. The US Food and Drug Administration has yet to provide the framework needed to govern how CBD ingestibles can be sold legally. The lack of regulation has kept large consumer packaged goods companies from entering the market. Federal guidance is needed for these players to get involved without risking the rest of their business.
 Key growth drivers for CBD will be natural health and wellness trends, product variety, expanded distribution channels, and a growing awareness of the benefits of CBD as a natural alternative to pharmaceuticals for cancer patients to athletes.
 Americans have utilized hemp in their diets for health and other practical reasons throughout history, and hemp is a strong and highly versatile crop that has many good attributes including a host of scientifically confirmed medicinal properties. There is strong evidence that hemp, now legally grown in the US, will see a nearly unprecedented investment as hemp is believed to have an ability to grow the US economy via new jobs and commerce, while providing any number of valuable products including in the healthcare sector.
 Hemp has long been known for its use in textiles, but has nutrients, proteins and essential fatty acids as well. The company is developing and focused on a wide variety of CBD products derived from hemp, as the market is experiencing growth from different categories including healthy drinks and medicine.

The beverage industry and the biotechnology industry have and continue to make huge investments including new companies and established companies alike. These sectors are just two of many examples, and the Company’s management believes that CBD derived from hemp will ultimately become a staple in American life, and alleviate any number of health and wellness issues, and generally elevate the quality of life.
 Hemp as a crop has some interesting redeeming qualities that farmers enjoy. Hemp is an extremely hardy crop, and requires less water than many other crops, and also rejuvenates the soil by adding back many critical nutrients that other crops do not. This can have a stabilizing effect, as sustainable plants often assist in developing sustainable businesses. The legal distinction from marijuana in the US is that hemp contains less than 0.3% of the cannabinoid chemical THC, which is the psychoactive component in the cannabis plant family.
 Due to hemp’s nutritional and medicinal qualities, the Company has decided to focus its effort on building a near vertically integrated business model. That is, it will seek to strategically partner with farmers. A main driver of the Company’s business model is to exploit in the most positive way its proprietary processing technology and knowhow. Today the Company purchases hemp biomass on the open market, and then reduces it into a variety of unique cannabinoids, including CBD, CBG, CBN etc. Hemp is fast becoming a highly sought-after ingredient in food and drink, cosmetics and skincare, and healthcare and general nutrition centric products. Furthermore, as the 2018 Farm Bill will boost hemp genetics research, the Company expects that many plant geneticists with an interest in hemp will begin to focus their efforts due to the new and greatly improved legal framework in the U.S., and at least for the short-term it is very likely the large agriculture companies will take a wait and see attitude, at least until the majority, if not all of the states publish their regulations, and large consumer markets, and packaged goods companies’ appetites begin to fit their large size. However, for growth companies, the Company believes there is ample opportunity as an early-mover to create CBD derived from hemp branded product lines in multiple categories. 
 On December 20, 2018 President Trump signed into law the 2018 Farm Bill (included in the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018). Hemp is defined in the legislation as the cannabis plant with one key difference: hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), the compound in the plant most commonly associated with getting a person high. In other words, hemp cannot get you high. For decades, federal law did not differentiate hemp from other cannabis plants, all of which were effectively made illegal in 1937 under the Marijuana Tax Act and formally made illegal in 1970 under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) which banned cannabis of any kind.
 Pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp products and their derivatives were removed as a prohibited substance under the CSA, subject to certain conditions, such as the percent amount of THC in the product, as well as an USDA-approved state regulatory program. On October 31, 2019 the USDA issued an interim final rule regarding the Establishment of a Domestic Hemp Production Program which authorized hemp to be grown and processed legally in the United States and made it legal to transport in interstate commerce. Although this interim final rule became effective on the date of publication, there is a possibility it will be modified from its current application. 
 Specifically, the Farm Bill defined hemp as cannabis and cannabis derivatives (e.g., CBD) with extremely low (no more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis) concentrations of the psychoactive compound THC, and removed those “hemp” products from the CSA. Subsequent to the enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill, many companies entered the market, and prominent national retailers began carrying CBD products in different formats, such as edibles, topicals, vapor products, tinctures, and pet foods.

The Farm Bill did not eliminate federal oversight of CBD products and in fact explicitly recognized certain federal agencies’ continued jurisdiction. In certain circumstances, hemp products remain subject to other regulatory bodies, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), state and local regulation, et al. For example, certain marketers of CBD products have received warning letters from FDA regarding particular health claims made in the promotion of those marketers’ products. Similarly, some states have banned or proposed to ban smokable hemp “cigarettes.” 
 FDA, moreover, has approved as a drug EPIDIOLEX for treatment of various seizures. EPIDIOLEX’s active ingredient is a particular CBD isolate. That approval, while showing that the safe and effective therapeutic benefits of CBD can be proven, may also prevent the over-the-counter sale of CBD products for the same purpose in the same formulation. 
 FDA, on April 2, 2019, announced that it was beginning to study if and how to regulate CBD products. It is unclear what, if anything, FDA will recommend, including whether to recommend a new regulatory group, or whether to regulate it as dietary supplement. Under dietary supplement regulation, manufacturers are required to register with FDA and comply with certain defined Good Manufacturing Practices, and refrain from medical claims. FDA has stated that is does not believe that CBD products would properly be regulated as a dietary supplement without further action; however, in its April 2 announcement FDA included a statement that products containing CBD might be regulated as dietary supplements. (Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new steps to advance agency’s continued evaluation of potential regulatory pathways for cannabis-containing and cannabis-derived products FDA.
 https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-new-steps-
 advance-agencys-continued-evaluation.)
 
The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law. 
 While the Farm Bill legalizes hemp, it does not create a system in which people can grow it as freely as they can grow carrots or parsley and this is still a highly regulated crop in the United States for both personal and industrial production. 
 Many experts predicted that the Biden/Harris administration would remove hemp and marijuana from the list of schedule 1 drugs after taking office. While Biden supports marijuana decriminalization, efforts to legalize cannabis consumption are likely to continue at the state level for now even though both the House and the Senate are actively working on a Bill aimed at legalization. In 2022, employers will need to review their policies and ensure that they comply with evolving laws, particularly those covering medical marijuana patients Once the regulatory uncertainty clears, the Company expects that major CPG brands waiting on the sidelines will begin to jump and mainstream retailers such as grocery stores, big box outlets, and warehouse clubs will carry a full slate of CBD products.
 The pandemic has been a significant extinction event for hundreds of small brands in the US CBD market and we believe that Real Brands is a well-positioned survivor and ready to benefit from an expanding market. 
 In summary, the regulatory landscape remains in flux and uncertain, but management believes that responsibly manufactured and marketed products are viable under current regulations and will continue to be so as the regulatory structure evolves.

Competition
Our competition is primarily companies that manufacture and produce CBD derived from hemp consumer products. This is a broad market and encompasses startup companies and well-established companies with international brands. Despite the significant competition in this industry from larger, well-established and well-capitalized companies, we believe that the emerging nature of this industry, our consumer products experience and our ability to leverage the flexibility of a start-up may give us some advantages. Specifically, without a large organizational structure we expect to establish a broader product offering more quickly and in a cost-effective manner. There are no assurances, however, that we will ever be successful in effectively competing in this market segment.  
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had four full time employees. 
 Corporate History
 
Real Brands, Inc. (“Real Brands” or the “Company”), was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on November 6, 1992. The Company was formed under the name Mercury Software. From 1997 to 2005 the Company changed its name several times. On October 10, 2005, the Company changed its name to Global Beverage Solutions, Inc. and began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol GBVS.OB. 
 On October 22, 2013, the Company changed its name to Real Brands, Inc. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) approved Real Brands’ corporate actions regarding its name change and its new stock symbol request and approved Real Brands’ 150:1 Reverse Stock Split. The new symbol was designated as GBVSD. On November 19, 2013, the ticker symbol changed to RLBD. 
 On October 22, 2020, the majority of the shareholders of the Company, by written consent, agreed to a “reverse triangular” merger with CASH Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed for the purpose of the merger, and Canadian American Standard Hemp Inc., a Delaware corporation (“CASH”), whereby the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of CASH and merged it with and into CASH Acquisition Corp. Real Brands’ name and trading symbol were maintained, with CASH shareholders acquiring majority control of Real Brands. 
 The merger was accounted for as a reverse merger, whereby CASH was considered the accounting acquirer and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. In accordance with the accounting treatment for a “reverse merger”, the Company’s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger has been replaced with the historical financial statements of CASH prior to the reverse merger.
