People management has evolved significantly over the last 30 years from an administrative, payroll-centric cost center to a highly strategic function focused on talent management and employee engagement. To be competitive in today’s environment, organizations are increasingly reliant on this function as they seek to leverage people analytics to identify trends and track performance across their workforce. However, most existing HCM solutions lack the comprehensive functionality, ease-of-use, and integration capabilities needed to facilitate effective people management. These limitations are particularly problematic for SMBs which often lack the technical, financial, and people resources of larger organizations.
Our unified, cloud-native platform is purpose-built for leaders and configured by industry with the tools they need to optimize all aspects of people management. See “Our Solution and Key Strengths” section below, within Item 1. Business, for what we believe are the key strengths of our platform.
Our easy-to-use platform incorporates intuitive analytics functionality, enabling SMBs to automate and simplify mission-critical people management processes and enhance visibility into their business operations. Our platform is architected for extensibility and features an open application programming interface (“API”) led interoperability engine that allows customers to easily connect their people data with third-party applications to create a seamlessly integrated digital ecosystem. Our products are supported by a differentiated implementation process and vibrant community of users, which together ensure customers can take full advantage of our platform.
We market and sell our solutions through direct sales teams, leveraging our strong demand generation engine and broker partnerships. We primarily target companies with 10 to 1,000 employees. We intend to grow our customer base by accelerating the expansion of our sales coverage and broker networks in both new and existing markets, with a focus on the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States (“Tier 1 markets”), which encompasses 33% of the U.S. population and where we see substantial opportunity. We also intend to grow our customer base through our industry focused product and go-to-market strategy. We market our products via a bundled pricing strategy where we charge customers on a per-employee-per-month (“PEPM”) basis and have demonstrated success at driving growth through the expansion of our Cor HCM and Payroll product bundle. We intend to continue to expand our product suite and further cross-sell products into our existing customer base.
Industry Background
Human capital management is an evolving necessity for organizations, with several key trends that have shaped today’s environment.
The Evolution of People Management
Over the last 30 years, the demands of people leaders and people management strategies have significantly evolved in response to shifting demographics, employee expectations, and technological capabilities. As a result, the importance of people management has been elevated from a payroll-centric cost center to a highly strategic function focused on talent management as a critical component of business competitiveness.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, HCM systems focused on moving paper-based Human Resources (“HR”) processes to software-based processes. The initial benefit was around the elimination of paper trails, but there was limited focus on modernizing the work. In the mid-to-late 2000s, the emergence of SaaS brought a focus on improving the old paper processes that had been converted to software. Numerous point solutions evolved to tackle each of the key HCM functions. This led to greater system fragmentation, an overcomplicated user experience, and increased costs. At the same time, the separation between work and life began to blur, driving an increased need for employee engagement tools. HCM became a strategic business function and the tools to support it are now mission critical for companies. 
The COVID-19 pandemic further reinforced this strategic shift as the HR function proved vital to companies striving to maintain morale and productivity for both remote workforces and essential employees. Following on the heels of the pandemic, the “Great Resignation” forced companies to evolve their people management practice yet again, creating a need for employee engagement in every industry, including blue-collar fields. These evolving demands have accelerated the trend of modern HCM technology replacing manual processes and outdated systems with strategic platforms that surface business insights, enabling leaders to make data-driven decisions.
To address this lack of engagement, many HCM solution providers targeted their product development efforts at enhancing the employee experience. But the solutions were surface-level employee portals, similar to social media platforms, to drive engagement. Companies quickly found that their employees were not looking for another social platform, especially one provided by their employer. Other unsuccessful attempts to drive engagement included adding gamification attributes to influence behavior, such as encouraging employees to complete compliance training. These product features failed to address the top factor that impacts employee engagement, an employee’s leader. 
One of the top drivers of employment engagement is driven by an employee’s direct manager. Employers have long known employee engagement leads to higher productivity and decreased risk of attrition. Even so, a 2022 study conducted by Gallup revealed that only 32% of employees in the U.S. are engaged by their work. Given this, it is not surprising that a 2019 Gartner study showed employee engagement to be the need least met by existing HCM solutions. We believe the next evolution of HCM software will be empowering leaders with the tools to effectively strengthen engagement, manage career development, and enhance the employee experience in order to drive business results.
Complex Regulatory Environment
The ever-evolving regulatory landscape continues to place a burden on small businesses. For example, the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) has required small businesses to quickly adapt to complex requirements. In addition, businesses are forced to navigate thousands of state and local tax codes and industry-specific labor laws. As a result, demand has increased for HCM platforms that enable them to maintain a robust compliance framework and abstract the complexity of regulatory changes, such as responding to special employee leave provisions.
Growing Importance of People Analytics
In recent years, businesses have begun to appreciate the value they could derive from stronger data analytics capabilities. SMB leaders are increasingly willing to invest in data-driven decision-making tools to improve their business performance. An IDC survey found that analyzing data and employee engagement had the highest level of third-party investment. In addition, a survey by Gartner showed that 64% of participants ranked improvement of reporting quality and people analytics as their main HR objective when evaluating HCM solutions. SMBs have a particular need for all-in-one solutions considering their unique capacity constraints, such as single person HR departments and limited in-house legal and information technology (“IT”) support.
Unique Needs of SMBs
SMBs prefer solutions that have the following key characteristics:
•    Ease of Implementation. The ability to get mission critical solutions up and running seamlessly and successfully without overburdening company resources.
•    Ease of Use. Intuitive design and simple workflows for leaders and their teams.
•    Full Suite of Solutions. Fully integrated platform to serve as a single system of record for all HCM functions with built-in critical capabilities such as compliance, mobility, analytics, and security.
•    Highly Scalable Cloud-based Platform. Flexible solutions built to meet the needs of organizations as they grow in size and complexity.
•    Industry-specific Focus. Product, customer experience, and community tailored to unique industry needs.
•    Interoperability. The ability to connect the power of people data across entire business through public APIs, events, and notifications.
Limitations of Existing Solutions
The vast majority of SMBs still rely on legacy solutions to fulfill their HCM technology requirements. These product offerings are typically provided by national and regional payroll service bureaus or in-house solutions built on top of generic enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems. In addition to these legacy solutions, advancements in cloud technology have led to the emergence of other competing SaaS-based HCM offerings. Both legacy and other competing SaaS offerings possess significant limitations in addressing the full HCM needs of SMBs. These limitations include:
•Incomplete HCM Solutions Lacking in Product Breadth and Depth. Many existing HCM platforms offer incomplete product suites that deliver only a portion of the capabilities required by SMBs or offer ‘full suites’ comprised of products with limited functionality, capable of addressing only the most basic use cases. Often these solutions rely on archaic technologies such as batch payroll processing engines and lack robust compliance and security features. Users of these incomplete platforms are often forced to use multiple products from multiple vendors or continue to manage processes manually outside of their HCM solution.
•Lack a Unified Approach. Many existing HCM ‘suites’ are comprised of a patchwork of stand-alone applications with limited integration. This lack of unification inhibits the real-time synchronization of data across multiple HCM applications and makes it difficult for SMBs to maintain a single, uniform system of record for employee data. As a result, SMBs are forced to rely on manual, redundant, and error-prone processes to manage and track employee data, which can often lead to untimely payroll, poor employee engagement, and significant compliance issues such as incomplete reporting, and inadequate data security.
•Difficult to Integrate with Third-Party Systems. Most existing HCM solutions are built on inflexible, closed technology architectures, and are not designed to communicate with external applications. These rigid systems make it difficult for SMBs to integrate HCM tools with other key systems of record such as ERP and POS applications and often require significant manual work to extract and port data to execute routine functions. This inhibits organizations’ ability to establish flexible digital ecosystems capable of addressing the evolving needs of a growing business.
•Lack Robust Analytics Capabilities. Many existing SMB solutions lack tools which are both sophisticated and easy-to-use to access, aggregate, analyze, and act on employee data in real-time. As a result, SMBs are unable to efficiently derive actionable workforce insights and make critical, informed decisions to improve the way they hire, manage, and develop people, such as uncovering turnover trends based on demographics, location, and tenure.
•‘One Size Fits All’ Approach. Certain industry verticals have unique people management requirements, such as job costing for manufacturing companies and blended overtime calculations for healthcare employees who work shifts at different pay rates. However, most existing HCM solutions provide generic out-of-the-box functionality and limited configurability, with professional service teams that often lack vertical expertise. As a result, SMBs struggle to address evolving industry-specific people management needs and reporting requirements with existing HCM solutions.
•Difficult to Use. Many existing solutions have arcane, inflexible user interfaces that lack the intuitive, consumer-like feel of modern SaaS applications. These solutions are often difficult for both employees and leaders to use effectively without significant training. Additionally, many existing HCM suites typically lack consistent functionality and user experience across different devices, and typically require multiple logins to traverse between applications. As a result, people leaders are often forced to revert to time-consuming manual processes to execute simple HR tasks and assist with tedious employee troubleshooting.
•Not Designed for People Leaders. Many existing HCM solutions were built with engagement functionality specifically designed for employees, not people leaders who have the most influence over employee engagement. These solutions often lack the end-to-end functionality and powerful analytics required by people leaders for effective people management. As a result, people leaders are incapable of fully leveraging their HCM solution to hire and retain the right talent, optimize routine functions, and transform people management into a strategic driver of business performance.

Our Market Opportunity
We estimate our current annual recurring market opportunity is $29 billion in the U.S. and we expect the opportunity to grow as the number of SMBs increase and we continue to expand our product portfolio. To estimate our market opportunity, we identified the number of companies in the U.S. with an employee count between 10 and 1,000. Based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released in December 2021, there were approximately 1.3 million businesses with between 10 to 1,000 employees, totaling 57.6 million employees within our target demographic. We then applied our $42 total list PEPM rate as of June 30, 2022 for our full suite of products including Cor HCM, Workforce Management, Benefits Administration, and Talent Management to derive our current total addressable market opportunity of $29 billion.
Growth Strategy
We intend to capitalize on our market opportunity with the following key growth strategies:
•Expand Sales Coverage. We believe there is substantial opportunity to continue to broaden our customer base. As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 29,800 customers, which represented a small percentage of the U.S. market for HCM and payroll solutions. As a result of our historical footprint, a significant majority of our revenue is derived from the Great Lakes and Southeast regions of the United States. We focus our sales resources in the top 50 most densely populated United States cities. We intend to drive new customer additions by expanding our sales coverage, primarily in Tier 1 markets, where there is a substantial opportunity to grow our sales coverage and customer base. Sales coverage in Tier 1 markets increased from 20% to 28% in the last fiscal year. This is compared to 32% coverage in Tier 2 markets, or the subsequent 15 most populous U.S. metropolitan markets and 59% coverage in Tier 3 markets, or the 20 subsequent most populous U.S. metropolitan markets. We believe that our go-to-market strategy positions us well to scale our business efficiently and effectively into these markets.
•Accelerate Broker Channel Partnerships. Benefits brokers are trusted advisors to SMBs and are influential in the HCM selection process. We will continue to work with our existing broker partners and intend to expand our broker network through regional and national partnerships to drive customer acquisition.
•Expand Industry-specific Functionality and Leadership. SMBs in certain industries require unique functionality for their people management needs. We designed our platform to be easily configurable for industry-specific applications in key verticals such as manufacturing, healthcare, restaurants, and professional services. We will continue to expand our solutions and expertise in both existing and new key industries.
•Expand Product Penetration within Existing Customer Base. Our PEPM is increasing as we continue to grow our HCM suite. Our customers typically start with our Cor HR and Payroll solution, eventually expanding their usage of our platform over time. Because our product offerings have expanded significantly over the last few years, we have a significant opportunity to further penetrate our existing customer base.
•Continue to Innovate and Add New Solutions. Given our customer centric approach, we collaborate with our clients in the future development of our product offerings. We have a robust product roadmap that is specifically focused on enhancing our ability to address the unmet needs of our customers and prospective customers. We intend to continue to invest significantly in research and development, particularly regarding the functionality of our platform, to sustain and advance our product leadership.
•Pursue Strategic M&A. We have successfully acquired and integrated several businesses that complement and enhance our software and technology capabilities. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions, ensuring we pursue strategies that expand the depth of our product portfolio and drive revenue synergies through cross sale opportunities. Our focused M&A strategy will help us to continue to drive growth and expand our market footprint and product leadership.

Our target customers are companies with 10 to 1,000 employees and we specialize in manufacturing, healthcare, restaurants, and professional service industries. We currently have more than 2.3 million active employees on our platform.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions through a direct sales team, comprised of field sales, insides sales and client sales, each organized by customer size, geography, and industry. Our field sales team focuses on generating new sales to prospects with more than 50 employees, while our inside sales team drives new sales to organizations with less than 50 employees. Our client sales team cross-sells additional bundles to existing customers. Our sales professionals are trained to take a consultative approach to uncover the specific challenges and industry-specific nuances faced by customers and ensure the right solutions are provided. Our sales footprint has historically been concentrated in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. We believe there is an attractive opportunity to grow our sales teams in Tier 1 markets.
A core component of our sales and marketing strategy is our partnerships with key centers of influence (“COIs”), which include benefits brokers, financial advisors, financial institutions, and HR consultants. These partnerships enhance our sales motion by generating high quality referrals and providing credibility to our product offerings.
We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities, and build brand awareness through our direct marketing programs and robust network of COIs. We believe that our sales success is attributable to our differentiated unified platform, our ability to generate high customer return on investment, and our reputation for superior customer service. Our principal marketing efforts consist of paid, owned, and earned marketing strategies, including robust organic search engine optimization, paid digital media, account based marketing, channel partner marketing, and live and virtual events. Additionally, our HR Center of Excellence is an award-winning resource hub that provides existing and prospective customers with white papers, webinars, and industry research to help organizations optimize human capital management.

We expensed research and development costs through our consolidated statements of operations of $43.1 million and $36.0 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, we capitalized research and development costs on our consolidated balance sheets of $29.8 million and $21.2 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our research and development personnel are principally located in Ohio and Texas, although many of our associates operate virtually. We seek to hire highly experienced personnel wherever they are located.
Our Service Model
GUIDE Implementation Model
•    GUIDE is our differentiated implementation methodology, where we work to Gather, Understand, Import, Deliver, and Evaluate (“GUIDE”), ensuring a successful and seamless transition to our products.
•    GUIDE Elite is a service that offers our larger prospective customers and all broker-referred clients a project manager who serves as the single point of contact and go-to implementation expert throughout the process.

Our larger customers are assigned a dedicated Customer Success Manager who is focused on driving the value of existing solutions, conducting Executive Business Reviews for strategic planning, and serving as a trusted advisor.
Seasonality
Our revenues are seasonal in nature. Recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms, such as Form W-2, Form 1099, and Form 1095 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs (such as bonuses) for our clients. Because payroll forms are typically processed in the third quarter of our fiscal year, third quarter revenue and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters. These seasonal fluctuations in revenues can also have an impact on gross profits. Historical results impacted by these seasonal trends should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future results of operations.
Intellectual Property

Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of laws and intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We require our associates and other employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. In addition, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our applications are also essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position in our industry.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate our rights or to copy or obtain and use our proprietary technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult and costly, and we may not be successful in detecting or preventing unauthorized activities.
We expect that providers of HCM and payroll solutions such as ours may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the market and the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of our competitors or other third parties might make a claim of infringement against us, which would require us to defend ourselves regardless of the merits of such claim, and could divert the attention of management and cause us to incur costs.
Segment Information
We operate in a single operating segment and a single reporting segment. Since we operate as one segment, all required financial information is presented at the consolidated financial statement level.
Competition
The market for HCM and payroll solutions is fragmented, highly competitive, and rapidly changing. Our competitors vary for each of our solutions and include both enterprise and micro-focused software providers, such as legacy payroll service bureaus (ADP, Paychex, UKG), cloud HCM software providers (Paylocity, Paycom), and other regional service bureaus and in-house ERP software providers that offer limited functionality.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•    Benefits of a cloud-based technology platform.
•    Breadth and depth of product functionality.
•    Configurability and ease of use of our solutions.
•    Modern, intuitive user experience. 
•    Ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly.
•    Domain expertise in HCM and payroll.
•    Ease of implementation.
•    Quality of implementation and customer service.
•    Real-time web-based payroll processing.
•    Integration with a wide variety of third-party applications and systems.
•    Interoperability and data access.
We believe that we compete favorably on these factors within the SMB market. We believe our ability to remain competitive will depend on the success of our continued investment in sales and marketing, research and development, and implementation and customer services.
Regulation
As a provider of payroll and HCM solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients, employees of our clients, vendors and our employees. Data privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and in other countries. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal and state government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations affecting or regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. These include, for example, rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Family Medical Leave Act, the Affordable Care Act, state breach notification laws and state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. Further, because some of our clients have international operations, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other foreign data privacy laws may impact our processing of certain client and employee information.
In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that apply to them. As such, our products and services may become subject to increasing and/or changing regulatory requirements, including changes in tax, benefit and other laws, and as these requirements proliferate, we may be required to change or adapt our products and services to comply. Changing regulatory requirements might reduce or eliminate the need for some of our products and services, block us from developing new products and services or have an adverse effect on the functionality and acceptance of our solution. This might in turn impose additional costs upon us to comply, modify or further develop our products and services. It might also make introduction of new products and services more costly or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate or prevent introduction of such new products and services. For example, the adoption of new money transmitter or money services business statutes in jurisdictions or changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations, could subject us to registration or licensing or limit business activities until we are appropriately licensed.
Our ability to comply with and address the continuously evolving requirements and regulations applicable to our business depends on a variety of factors, including the functionality and design of our solutions and the manner in which our clients and their employees utilize them. We have implemented operating policies and procedures to protect the accuracy, privacy and security of our clients’ and their employees’ information and voluntarily undergo certain periodic audits and examinations and maintain certain certifications to demonstrate our commitment to regulatory compliance.
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. See the discussion contained in Item 1.A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding changes in laws and regulations that could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
Human Capital 
As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 2,300 associates, primarily located in the United States, with the majority working virtually. We add temporary workers for business peaks and engage consultants for specialized functions. Our associates are not represented by labor unions, nor have we experienced a work stoppage.
We were recognized as a Top Workplace USA in 2022 and 2021 by Energage, LLC. In 2021, we were also recognized as a Top Workplace for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) Practices by Energage, LLC, the results of which have not yet been released for 2022. 
Our Guiding Principles
Our culture is guided by principles that encourage our associates to thrive and bring their whole selves to work. Our guiding principles are designed to act as a North Star for our associates in how they work with a colleague, for a client, and in the community:

•    Take Care of Customers First. Our customers are our heroes. When they win, we win. 
•    Take Care of Each Other. There’s nothing better than working with friends who look out for you. 
•    Do the Right Thing. It’s not always the easy way—but it’s what really matters. 
•    Think Big, Dream Big. Never say never! Solve problems, invent a better way, disrupt the status quo. 
•    Compete to Win. We embody the spirit of success in everything we do, in our habits and routines, our relationships, and in the energy and accountability we bring to the game. 
•    Have Fun Along the Way. Buckle up, it’s a fast-paced business! That’s why we celebrate the wins, laugh in the face of adversity, and enjoy the ride. 
Talent Acquisition and Development
We strive to provide best-in-class benefits, performance rewards, and career development opportunities to attract and retain top talent. We recently expanded benefit options to include domestic partner coverage. In an effort to further invest in our associates, bolster associate engagement and align our associates’ interests with shareholders’ objectives, we provide a one-time, new hire equity grant to all eligible full-time associates that vests over time. We support professional development through tuition reimbursement, industry credential support, career coaching, 100+ classes covering technical, leadership, and professional skills, and tailored development plans.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are actively committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DE&I”). We embrace the diverse mosaic of our associates and build high-performing teams dedicated to success and belonging. The table below summarizes our workforce demographics as of June 30, 2022: 
 | Total 
Gender: | 
Female | 50.3% 
Male | 49.7% 
 | 100.0%
Ethnicity: | 
Native American or Alaska Native | 0.3% 
Asian | 6.7% 
Black or African American | 10.0% 
Hispanic or Latinx | 4.8% 
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander | 0.1% 
Two or More Races | 3.3% 
White | 70.4% 
Undisclosed* | 4.4% 
 | 100.0%

* Individuals preferred not to disclose ethnicity
Our DE&I strategy is guided by four pillars: 
1.Strategic Education and Awareness
2.Transparency in our Data
3.Equity of Pay, Hiring and Treatment of Targeted Populations
4.Purpose and Perspective
These pillars outline the foundation of our action steps as they relate to the goals of the entire organization. We established corporate goals to increase the inclusion and belonging of, and the number of associates and leaders from underrepresented groups and plan to continue to evolve these goals over time to improve representation. In developing these goals, we conducted an internal needs assessment and concluded that our opportunities are to focus on educating our associates, clients and partners, providing transparency to our stakeholders, and recruiting, retaining and promoting diverse leadership and perspectives across the Company. 
We have incorporated our DE&I strategy and learning into associate onboarding and leader trainings as our associates play a key role in fostering a culture of inclusion. Additionally, our commitment to DE&I is reflected through our seven employee resource groups (“ERGs”). We believe our ERGs create a community of inclusion and belonging, and create a safe space for learning and dialogue around the celebrations and challenges that diverse communities face. Each ERG has an executive sponsor and is supported by senior leaders across the Company. 
Community Giving
Giving back is in our DNA. We empower our associates to make a difference in a way that we believe is meaningful to them. We dedicate several days each year for Paycor It Forward, where our associates give back to the communities where we live and work. Our Community Partners program is a grassroots organization funded by associates who choose to give their own time and resources to serve. The Paycor Community Impact Fund provides project grants to local philanthropic organizations.
