Summary

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901. The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, automobiles and aircraft. As discussed below, our operations are organized into 14 business units, which are divided into ten groups under our four segments: Residential Products; Industrial Products; Furniture Products; and Specialized Products.
Overview of Our Segments

Our Residential Products segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coil bedsprings. Today, we supply a variety of components and machinery used by bedding manufacturers in the production and assembly of their finished products. Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs. We also produce or distribute carpet cushion, fabric, and geo components.
Innovative proprietary products and low cost have made us the largest U.S. manufacturer in many of these businesses. We strive to understand what drives consumer purchases in our markets and focus our product development activities on meeting end-consumer needs. We attain a cost advantage from efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, purchasing leverage, and large-scale production. Sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.

Segment Financial Information

For information about sales to trade customers, sales by product line, EBIT, and total assets of each of our segments, refer to Note E on page 82 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure. In conjunction with the change in executive officers, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed effective January 1, 2017. As a result, the composition of our four segments also changed to reflect the new structure. The new segment structure is largely the same as prior years except the Home Furniture Group moved from Residential Products to Furniture Products (formerly Commercial Products) and the Machinery Group moved from Specialized Products to Residential Products. 
In addition, the changes in LIFO reserve are now recognized within the segments to which they relate (primarily Industrial Products). Previously segment EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) reflected the FIFO basis of accounting for certain inventories and an adjustment to the LIFO basis for these inventories was made at the consolidated financial statement level. These changes were retrospectively applied to all periods presented. The methods and assumptions that we use in estimating our LIFO reserve did not change. 
Strategic Direction

Key Financial Metric

Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price. Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 companies over rolling three-year periods through an approach that employs four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases. 
Our incentive programs reward return generation and profitable growth. Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 320 peers). 
For information about our TSR targets and performance see the discussion under "Total Shareholder Return" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 28. 
Returning Cash to Shareholders

During the past three years, we generated $1.36 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth (capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions. After funding those priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock. 
For information about dividends and share repurchases see the discussion under "Pay Dividends" and "Repurchase Stock" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 44.

PART I

Portfolio Management

We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow. We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest). This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as business unit return, growth of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), EBIT margin, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and operating cash flows. Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets. Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, improve market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital. To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital. Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.
Disciplined Growth

We revised our TSR framework in 2016 to moderately increase the expected long-term contribution from revenue growth to 6-9% (from 4-5% previously). Over the last three years, the Company has generated combined unit volume and acquisition growth of 5% per year on average, but this growth was partially offset by divestitures, commodity deflation and currency impact. 
Our long-term 6-9% annual revenue growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We primarily seek acquisitions within our Grow businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage). We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, and be in an attractive and growing market; (b) create value by enhancing TSR; (c) for stand-alone businesses: generally possess annual revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for bolt-on businesses: generally possess annual revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.
Acquisitions

2018
On January 31, 2018, we acquired Precision Hydraulic Cylinders (PHC), a leading global manufacturer of
engineered hydraulic cylinders primarily for the materials handling market. The purchase price was $85 million. This business has current annual revenues of $81 million and represents a new growth platform for the Company. PHC serves a market of mainly large OEM customers utilizing highly engineered, co-designed components with long product life-cycles, yet representing a small percentage of the end product’s cost. PHC will form a new business group titled Hydraulic Cylinders and report in the Specialized Products segment.
2017
We acquired three businesses and the remaining interest in a joint venture for total consideration (including cash and stock) of $56 million. The first was a Canadian geosynthetic products distributor and installer for civil engineering and construction applications. The second was a Michigan-based surface-critical bent tube manufacturer supporting our private-label seating strategy in Work Furniture. We also acquired a North Carolina manufacturer of rebond carpet cushion. Finally, we acquired the remaining 20% ownership in an Asian joint venture in our Work Furniture business. 
7

PART I

2016
We acquired three businesses and the remaining interest in a joint venture for total consideration of $65 million. The first was a U.S. manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies. This business further expands our tube forming and fabrication capabilities, and also adds precision machining to our aerospace platform. We also acquired a distributor of geosynthetic products and a South African producer of mattress innersprings. Finally, we purchased the remaining interest in an Automotive joint venture in China. This business manufactures seat comfort products and lumbar support systems.
2015
We acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture. This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. The initial cash outlay for the 70% interest was $12 million and, per the terms of the agreement, we will acquire the remaining 30% in two equal parts, in the second quarters of 2018 and 2020. We have recorded a liability of approximately $14 million for these future payments. The recorded liability is based upon estimates and may fluctuate significantly until the payment dates. 
For more information regarding our acquisitions, please refer to Note Q on page 110 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Divestitures

2017
 We divested our final Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) business for total consideration of $9 million. This business unit was engaged in the manufacture of van interiors, including the racks, shelving and cabinets installed in service vans.
2016
We divested four businesses for net consideration of $72 million. We sold two wire operations, one that manufactured wire partitions, perimeter guarding and storage lockers, and another that manufactured automatic wire strapping equipment and related consumable wire products. We also sold a CVP operation that designed and assembled docking stations for mobile computing equipment in vehicles. Finally, we sold a Machinery business that assembled industrial sewing machines. 
2015
We sold four operations for total consideration of $36 million. We sold our final two Store Fixtures operations and a small operation within our CVP business. We also sold our Steel Tubing business unit. This business manufactured welded steel tubing and fabricated tube components.
For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 77 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

• | Adjustable beds 

Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where demand for our components is growing. We have also expanded internationally in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas to supply them more efficiently.

Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country. These risks include:

• | Foreign currency fluctuation 
• | Foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights 
• | Credit risks 
• | Increased costs due to tariffs, customs and shipping rates 
• | Potential problems obtaining raw materials, and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war
• | Inconsistent interpretation and enforcement, at times, of foreign tax laws 
• | Political instability in certain countries 

Our Specialized Products segment, which derives roughly 85% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks. These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.

2The two remaining Commercial Vehicle Products operations were sold in 2017 and 2016.
3The Steel Tubing Group was sold in 2015.
Distribution of Products

In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel. However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors. We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company.
Raw Materials

The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials. We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use. Among the most important are:

• | Various types of steel, including scrap, rod, wire, sheet, stainless and angle iron
• | Foam scrap 
• | Woven and non-woven fabrics 
• | Titanium and nickel-based alloys and other high strength metals 

We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:

• | Innersprings and foundations for mattresses 
• | Springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas
• | Automotive seating suspension systems 

We supply a substantial majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire. 
12

PART I

Customer Concentration

We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships. In 2017, our largest customer accounted for approximately 5% of our consolidated revenues. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 33% of these consolidated revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer’s sales are reported, including our Residential Products, Specialized Products and Furniture Products segments. 
Patents and Trademarks

The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our continuing operations as of December 31, 2017. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations as a whole. Substantially all of our patents relate to products manufactured by the Residential Products, Furniture Products, and Specialized Products segments, while nearly half of our trademarks relate to products manufactured by the Residential Products segment. We had 1,382 patents issued and 584 in process, and 1,021 trademarks registered and 223 in process. 
Some of our most significant trademarks include:

• | ComfortCore®, Mira-Coil®, VertiCoil®, Quantum®, Nanocoil®, Softech®, Lura-Flex®, Superlastic® and Active Support Technology® (mattress innersprings) 
• | Semi-Flex® (box spring components and foundations) 
• | Spuhl® (mattress innerspring manufacturing machines)

• | Schukra®, Pullmaflex® and Flex-O-Lator® (automotive seating products) 
• | Gribetz® and Porter® (quilting and sewing machines) 

13

PART I

Product Development
One of our strongest performing product categories across the company is ComfortCore®, our fabric-encased innerspring coils used in hybrid and other mattresses.  Our ComfortCore® volume continues to grow, and represented 40% of our total innerspring units by the end of 2017.  A growing number of our ComfortCore® innersprings contain a feature we call Quantum® Edge. These are narrow-diameter, fabric-encased coils that form a perimeter around a ComfortCore® innerspring set, replacing foam in a finished mattress.  Over 30% of our ComfortCore® innersprings have the Quantum® Edge feature, and the volume of ComfortCore® with Quantum® Edge continues to grow.  We are investing in capacity and adding machinery, supplied by our Spuhl® operation, to support the growth in ComfortCore® and Quantum® Edge.
Most of our other businesses are engaged in product development activities to protect our market position and support ongoing growth. 
Research and Development

We maintain research, development and testing centers in many locations around the world. We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas. However, we estimate our annual cost of research and development to be $25 million each year over the last three years.
Employees

At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 22,200 employees, of which 16,300 were engaged in production. Of the 22,200, approximately 12,700 were international employees (6,400 in China). Approximately 15% of our employees are represented by labor unions that collectively bargain for work conditions, wages or other issues. We did not experience any work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2017. Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2018. We had approximately 7,900 employees in Specialized Products; 6,400 in Residential Products; 5,700 in Furniture Products; and 1,400 in Industrial Products.
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 21,300 employees.

PART I

Competition

Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell. The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through innovation, product quality, competitive pricing and customer service. Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance as well. In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies. 
We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:

• | Bedding components 
• | Automotive seat support and lumbar systems 
• | Components for home furniture and work furniture
• | Carpet cushion 
• | Adjustable beds 
• | High-carbon drawn steel wire 
• | Bedding industry machinery 

We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.

For information about antidumping duty orders regarding innerspring and steel wire rod imports, please see "Competition" in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 29.
Seasonality

As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality. However, unusual economic factors in any given year, along with acquisitions and divestitures, can create sales variability and obscure the underlying seasonality of our businesses. Historically, our operating cash flows are stronger in the fourth quarter primarily related to the timing of cash collections from customers and payments to vendors.
Backlog

Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.
15

PART I

Working Capital Items

For information regarding working capital items, please see the discussion of "Cash from Operations" in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 40.
Government Contracts

The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any government.
Environmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws. While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
Internet Access to Information

We routinely post information for investors under the Investor Relations section of our website (www.leggett.com). Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition to these reports, the Company’s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Corporate Governance section. Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
