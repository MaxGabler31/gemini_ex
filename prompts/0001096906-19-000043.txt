Item 1.  Business
 
PASSUR® Aerospace, Inc. (“PASSUR” or the “Company”), a New York corporation founded in 1967, is a leading business intelligence company, providing predictive analytics and decision support technology for the aviation industry primarily to improve the operational performance and cash flow of airlines and the airports where they operate. The Company is recognized as a leader in airline and airport operational efficiency and business aviation marketing and operational solutions. PASSUR is a pioneer in the successful use of big data, with an aviation intelligence platform and suite of web-based solutions that address the aviation industry’s most intractable and costly challenges, including, but not limited to, the underutilization of airspace and airport capacity, delays, cancellations, and diversions. Several independent studies have estimated the annual direct costs of such inefficiencies in the United States at over $8 billion annually, and worldwide direct costs at over $30 billion annually. The Company’s technology platform is supported by its Aviation Intelligence Center of Excellence (“CoE”), a team of subject matter experts with extensive experience in airline, airport, and business aviation operations, finance, air traffic management, systems automation, and data visualization, with specific expertise in the operational and business needs, requirements, objectives, and constraints of the aviation industry.
 
PASSUR's mission is to grow global airspace capacity to meet current and future demand for air travel without adding to costly infrastructure.
 
We do this by creating a digital, collaborative platform where airlines, airports, and Air Navigation Service Providers (“ANSPs”) improve their operations often solving problems that can only be achieved by sharing common data and information on a common platform. These analytics extract meaningful information from data to predict, manage, and remove constraints on the surface and in the air.
  1
 
PASSUR’s information solutions are used by the largest North American airlines, more than 60 airport customers, including at the top 30 North American airports, hundreds of corporate aviation customers, and the U.S. government.
 
We are assembling a growing global operational database, driving an international operational platform PASSUR is providing to global customers. These capabilities can deliver our Platform faster than otherwise deploying company-sponsored systems.  The recent contracts entered into with Air France and other international customers are a demonstration of this new capability.
 
PASSUR provides data aggregation and consolidation, information, decision support, predictive analytics, collaborative solutions, and professional services. PASSUR sources and integrates a multitude of industry data to ensure complete and accurate information, processed in a way that supports specific operational and business requirements, including: proprietary surveillance technology installed at hundreds of locations; government surveillance and flight planning data feeds; a variety of commercial surveillance data feeds; and direct feeds from airlines and airports.
 
PASSUR solutions are focused on key objectives and outcomes of our primary market segments:

PASSUR Core Capabilities
 
PASSUR Integrated Traffic Management Platform
 
PASSUR Integrated Traffic Management (“PITM”) is, in the Company’s opinion, the industry’s first fully integrated air traffic optimization suite. PITM is a metrics-focused, Key Performance Indicator driven solution platform allowing the customer to first view the most critical information for its operation, and then, as necessary, enabling the user to drill down for better visualization and analysis.
 
PITM helps airlines complete their mission, on time, by focusing on the major operational constraints such as diversions, arrival and departure flow congestion, and airport surface congestion – as well as major irregular operations like disruptive weather, construction closures, large public events, and emergency incidents. The platform connects multiple aviation stakeholders and missions onto one platform, providing a collaborative environment within and between organizations, to address decisions that can only be solved through the real-time exchange of information on a common operating platform. PITM is also a platform enabling PASSUR’s partner companies to provide solutions which augment PASSUR capabilities to PASSUR’s customers. 

Aviation Intelligence Center of Excellence to Support Big Data
 
The Company’s Aviation Intelligence Center of Excellence (“CoE”) is a team of subject matter experts with extensive experience in airline, airport and business aviation operations, finance, air traffic management, systems automation, and data visualization, with specific expertise in the operational and business needs, requirements, objectives, and constraints of the aviation industry.
  3
 
These subject matter experts from the CoE understand the National Airspace System (“NAS”) and are able to translate these internal requirements and external conditions into information solutions that target specific, measurable problems with defined operational and financial performance metrics. These experts are complemented by a technical team of software engineers, human-computer interface designers, data scientists, radar engineers, database architects, physicists, and statisticians who have years of expertise in managing complex surveillance networks (hardware and software), as well as interpreting and converting complex, live aviation data feeds into robust decision support software solutions.
 
Integrated Surveillance Network and Integrated Aviation Database
 
The Company operates what it believes to be the largest and most extensive private commercial aircraft, airport, and airspace passive surveillance networks in the world. The PASSUR Network integrates additional key surveillance sources, to include Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (“ADS-B”), ASDE-X, Mode S, En Route Radar, Airline OOOI data, ACARS, fleet databases, as well as other sources. PASSUR also integrates extensive amounts of data from its customer’s systems, such as airline internal flight operations data, and Airport Operational Databases.
 
The PASSUR Network and database creates a direct data feed of critical flight and airspace behavior and conditions, an essential precursor resource for predictive analytics, real-time decision support, and performance analysis tools.
 
All the surveillance data acquired by the PASSUR Network is integrated and correlated into specialized databases to support predictive, real-time, and post operational requirements. PASSUR databases consolidate multiple overlapping data sets to ensure completeness, accuracy, fulfillment of specific operational requirements, and the normalization of data for a single-source authoritative record of operational performance. The data processed in these master data repositories supports the key capabilities and attributes of the PASSUR software.
 
Predictive Analytics
 
PASSUR decision support solutions are supported by predictive analytics algorithms, which use extensive historical data mining and pattern recognition, along with real-time surveillance data, to predict specific and detailed operating conditions. PASSUR predictive analytics are built on several core capabilities:

• | Real-time surveillance from the PASSUR Network gives the necessary breadth and granularity of data to support detailed scenario building and pattern recognition. This includes “fast-time simulation” of the airport surface and terminal area operation, applying the necessary decisions and constraints that controllers will have to apply in managing the traffic, as well as addressing the highly nonlinear and non-stationary nature of the airport operating environment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Detailed, granular data acquired by the PASSUR Network, supplemented by many other data sources collected within the integrated aviation database, is stored and correlated, providing the large sample sizes required to accurately model future performance based on past performance under similar or identical conditions. 
• | PASSUR is recognized by airlines as having the best flight predicted arrival time Estimated Time of Arrival (“ETA”) in the industry. More than ten independent airline studies have demonstrated the PASSUR predicted arrival time to be more accurate than any other source, including the airlines’ own internally-generated ETAs. The Company believes that this greater accuracy translates directly into significant operational and financial benefits in areas such as completing connections (passengers and bags), reduced fuel consumption, more efficient staffing plans, and greater on-time schedule completion. 

Decision Support Dashboards, Key Performance Indicators, and Management by Exception
 
Many PASSUR solutions are delivered in metrics-driven, dashboard format, simplifying and condensing extensive amounts of information into the most relevant operational and business metrics, thereby presenting those metrics in a manner that supports immediate performance assessment and actionable decisions. PASSUR solutions are designed so that users are alerted in real-time to specific conditions and recommended actions, especially during irregular operations, only when operations reach certain user-defined thresholds, thereby preventing information overload.

Collaborative Capabilities and Industrial Networks
 
Many PASSUR solutions include a collaborative layer which allows for instant information sharing and coordination of effort to a wide range of users in the aviation community. These include industrial networking capabilities, which leverage new technologies for business uses in the aviation sector, such as PASSUR’s Airport Information Network, a single North American-wide site for real time airport conditions, diversion management, and delay mitigation used by hundreds of aviation professionals. Other PASSUR collaborative capabilities include pre-departure sequencing and/or metering, arrival sequencing, and tarmac delay management.
 
PASSUR Business Intelligence (BI)
 
PASSUR continues to invest in the data aggregation, mining, and visualization tools to support the industry’s growing need for data-driven performance measurement and efficiency gains. PASSUR’s BI platform, supported by our Center of Excellence subject matter experts, helps aviation organizations and professionals identify the most important problems to target, where to invest resources for the greatest gains, and create “before” and “after” profiles to measure their return on investment.

The Company believes its business opportunities come from the following industry conditions and demand drivers: 
Airline Industry Dynamics
 

· | Increasing airline profitability, driving investment in technology. We expect airlines will take advantage of their increased profitability to invest in technology that can lower costs, increase revenue, and improve customer satisfaction. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Consolidation in the airline industry creating demand for a common operating system. Airlines are consolidating into much larger networks of greater complexity. There is increasing demand for a common operating platform that can service their entire system. This demand is growing worldwide, not just in the US. 
· | Current rate of projected traffic growth outpacing aviation infrastructure capacity. There is a dynamic and fast-growing market environment where the projected increase in airline flights over the next 10 years is expected to outpace the current infrastructure’s ability to meet the needs of the airline operators. Over time, airlines cannot rely on low-priced fuel and ancillary fees to grow their top line – they will need growth in capacity of the NAS to accommodate the expected growth in demand for air travel. PASSUR’s solutions help the aviation industry maximize the capacity of the existing infrastructure. PASSUR has a business model and platform that can be easily scaled to handle new opportunities and is continually identifying new ways to capitalize on and scale these existing capabilities. 
· | Increased susceptibility to systemic disruption. The NAS has become much more sensitive to disruptions, and less capable of quickly rebounding, because of tightly-packed airline schedules, growth in passenger volumes, reduction in fleet sizes, and congestion at several key airport metroplexes. The NAS is highly susceptible to disruptions at several key airport metroplexes, which have a chronic and disproportionate delay impact that ripples across the system. 
· | Growth in International Hub “MegaAirports.” A number of airports worldwide are positioning themselves to become global transfer hubs (examples include Toronto, Dubai, Istanbul, Mexico City, Panama, Bogota, Amsterdam Schiphol, and Frankfurt), and as a result are much more sensitive to traffic management constraints and disruptions and in search of solutions. This adds a new level of demand for PASSUR’s traffic management solutions, including our newest regional disruption management tools. 

Government Policy
 

· | Emphasis on infrastructure spending. The most recent U.S. election has resulted in an administration committed to large-scale infrastructure projects, which could include technologies, like PASSUR’s, designed to increase efficiencies to ensure that public investments in existing and new infrastructure are efficient and cost-effective. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Large government contracts combining both safety and efficiency capabilities. Today, there is a demand for a combination of safety-based Air Traffic Management (“ATM”) and efficiency-based ATM. Many of the requested efficiency capabilities are derived from airline and airport customers’ needs. 
· | Government contracts require proven commercial viability for public programs. Increasingly, government request for proposals for large-scale aviation systems and technologies require a proven track record of precursor models from the commercial sector, in order to shorten development time and ensure the broadest level of adoption by all stakeholders. Many companies regard PASSUR’s substantial commercial market share as a means to increase the probability of winning NextGen and government contracts through the combination of PASSUR’s commercial ATM (efficiency) with a partner’s government ATM (safety) capabilities. PASSUR has been recognized as the commercial leader in aviation efficiency solutions. 
· | Lower tolerance for severe disruptions. Public policy in the form of expensive fines levied on airlines reflects this change of attitude. Consumers want better information relating to aviation, and fewer delays. 
· | Limiting carbon emissions becoming a greater focus. Airlines are increasingly sensitive to the industry’s carbon footprint. Several of the PASSUR solutions impact both fuel savings as well as reductions in carbon emissions. 

 
 8
 
The Connected Airplane and Internet of Things (“IoT”)
 

· | The Connected Airplane and the IoT are expected to grow in the coming years. PASSUR’s existing aviation intelligence platform and solutions can integrate the vast array of data being generated from satellites, and sensors on airplanes. This platform can extract the most important data and integrate that data into a user-friendly solutions package for the user's critical real-time decisions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collaborative Decision Making
 

· | Airlines, airports, government, and other aviation stakeholders are requesting a collaborative decision-making platform. Large airlines need collaborative decision tools including common operating platforms, enabling instant coordination between system operations departments, hubs, and regional operators, and between airlines, airports, and ANSPs to solve complex operational procedures. Common use systems will incorporate airport-centric as well as airline-centric solutions. Airports are increasingly being tasked with providing more multi-airline operational services, previously provided by each airline. When airports provide collective services, redundancy and costs can be reduced. PASSUR has been asked by airlines, airports and ANSPs to help fulfill this need. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Automation and Data Standards
 

· | Shift from manual processes to automation creating large opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies. Many complex and expensive operational processes at airlines and airports are still manual, opening a large opportunity for automation enabling the realization of cost savings and efficiencies. These opportunities are especially prevalent in the areas of irregular operations, airspace and surface management, and operations where there is a heavy requirement for collaboration among airlines and airports. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | PASSUR’s entire network has used ADS-B for some time and PASSUR is looking forward to capitalizing on the increasing availability of ADS-B data. ADS-B will eventually become a ubiquitous form of aircraft surveillance.
