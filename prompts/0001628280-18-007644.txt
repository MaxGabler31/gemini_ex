Item 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
American Superconductor Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “AMSC®” or the “Company”) was founded on April 9, 1987. We are a leading provider of megawatt-scale solutions that lower the cost of wind power and enhance the performance of the power grid. In the wind power market, we enable manufacturers to field highly competitive wind turbines through our advanced power electronics products, engineering, and support services. In the power grid market, we enable electric utilities, industrial facilities, and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and distribute power through our transmission planning services and power electronics, and superconductor-based products. Our wind and power grid products and services provide exceptional reliability, security, efficiency, and affordability to our customers.
Our wind and power grid solutions help to improve energy efficiency, alleviate power grid capacity constraints and increase the adoption of renewable energy generation. Demand for our solutions is driven by the growing needs for renewable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar energy, and for modernized smart grids that improve power reliability, security, and quality. Concerns about these factors have led to increased spending by corporations as well as supportive government regulations and initiatives on local, state and national levels, including renewable portfolio standards, tax incentives, and international treaties. We estimate that today’s total annual addressable global market for our wind and grid solutions exceeds $6.0 billion.
We segment our operations into two market-facing business units: Wind and Grid. We believe this market-centric structure enables us to more effectively anticipate and meet the needs of wind turbine manufacturers, power generation project developers and electric utilities.

• | Wind. Through our Windtec Solutions™, our Wind business segment enables manufacturers to field wind turbines with exceptional power output, reliability, and affordability. We supply advanced power electronics and control systems, license our highly engineered wind turbine designs, and provide extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. Our design portfolio includes a broad range of drive trains and power ratings of 2 megawatts (“MW”) and higher. We provide a broad range of power electronics and software-based control systems that are highly integrated and designed for optimized performance, efficiency, and grid compatibility.


• | Grid. Through our Gridtec Solutions™, our Grid business segment enables electric utilities and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and distribute power with exceptional efficiency, reliability, security and affordability. We provide planning services that allow us to identify power grid congestion, poor power quality, and other risks, which help us determine how our solutions can improve network performance. These services often lead to sales of our grid interconnection solutions for wind farms and solar power plants, power quality systems and transmission and distribution cable systems. We also sell ship protection products to the U.S. Navy. 

Financial information about our segments can be found in Note 18, “Business Segments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein. 
Our fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. When we refer to a particular fiscal year, we are referring to the fiscal year beginning on April 1 of that same year. For example, fiscal 2017 refers to the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2017. Other fiscal years follow similarly.

Market opportunities
We provide solutions that address three key drivers of our business:

• | the evolving electric grid;


• | the electrification of the Naval fleet; and


• | the global demand for renewable energy.

Wind market overview
According to GlobalData, a research firm, approximately 52 Gigawatts ("GW") of wind generation capacity were added worldwide in 2017, as compared to 55 GW in 2016.  GlobalData anticipates that more than 53 GW of additional capacity will be added in 2018.
According to GlobalData, annual wind installations in India for calendar 2017 were 1.8 GW and for calendar 2018 are estimated to be 2.9 GW.
Several factors are expected to drive the future growth in the wind power market, including substantial government incentives and mandates that have been established globally, technological improvements, turbine cost reductions, the development of the offshore wind market, and increasing cost competitiveness with existing power generation technologies. Technological advances, declining turbine production cost and fluctuating prices for some fossil fuels continue to increase the competitiveness of wind versus traditional power generation technologies.
Our solutions for the wind market
5

We address the challenges of the wind power market by designing and engineering wind turbines, providing extensive support services to wind turbine manufacturers, and manufacturing and selling critical components for wind turbines.

• | Electrical Control Systems. We provide full electrical control systems (“ECS”) or a subset of those systems (“core electrical components”) to manufacturers of wind turbines designed by us. Our ECS regulate voltage, control power flows and maximize wind turbine efficiency, among other functions. To date, we have shipped enough core electrical components and complete ECS to power over 16,000 Megawatts (“MW”) of wind power. We believe our ECS represent approximately 5-10% of a wind turbine’s bill of materials. We believe that the annual total addressable market for ECS is approximately $3.5 billion of which the annual addressable market in India is expected to approach $400 million.


• | Wind Turbine Designs. We design and develop entire state-of-the-art onshore and offshore wind turbines with power ratings of 2 MWs and higher for manufacturers who are in the business of producing wind turbines or who plan to enter the business of manufacturing wind turbines. These customers typically pay us licensing fees, and in some cases royalties for wind turbine designs, and purchase from us the core electrical components or complete electrical control systems needed to operate the wind turbines.


• | Customer Support Services. We provide extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. These services range from providing designs for customers’ wind turbine manufacturing plants to establishing and localizing their supply chains and training their employees on proper wind turbine installation and maintenance. We believe these services enable customers to accelerate their entry into the wind turbine manufacturing market and lower the cost of their wind turbine platforms.

Our approach to the wind energy markets allows our customers to use our world-class turbine engineering capabilities while minimizing their research and development costs. These services and our advanced electrical control systems provide our customers with the ability to produce standardized or next-generation wind turbines at scale for their local market or the global market quickly and cost-effectively. Our team of highly experienced engineers works with clients to customize turbine designs specifically tailored to local markets while providing ongoing access to field services support and future technological advances.
Grid market overview
It is widely believed that the electricity grid in the U.S. is in need of modernization through a technology upgrade if it is to maintain reliability and adapt to the changing market needs.  In fact, a report written by The White House in 2013 and titled, “Economic Benefits of Increasing Electric Grid Resilience to Weather Outages” found that economic damage from weather-related power outages averaged between $18 and $33 billion per year between 2003 and 2012 – and went as high as $75 billion in 2008 and $52 billion in 2012, as a result of damage caused by Hurricanes Ike and Sandy, respectively.  Furthermore, the electric grid is also vulnerable to equipment failure, acts of terror, and threats to cyber security.  Recent events and the dependence on the safety, security, and economy of the electricity grid have prompted broad recognition worldwide of the need to modernize and enhance the reliability and security of power grids.
Power grid operators worldwide face various challenges, including:

• | Stability. Power grid operators are confronting power quality and stability issues arising from intermittent renewable energy sources and from the capacity limitations of transmission and overhead distribution lines and underground cables.


• | Reliability. Traditional transmission lines and cables often reach their reliable voltage stability limit well below their thermal threshold. Driving more power through a power grid when some lines and cables are operating above their voltage stability limit during times of peak demand can cause either unacceptably low voltage in the power grid (a brownout) or risk of a sudden, uncontrollable voltage collapse (a blackout).


• | Capacity. The traditional way to enable increases in power grid capacity without losing voltage stability is to install more overhead power lines and underground cables. However, permitting new transmission and distribution lines can take 10 years or more due to various public policy issues, such as environmental, aesthetic, and health concerns. In urban and metropolitan areas, installing additional conventional underground copper cables is similarly challenging, since many existing underground corridors carrying power distribution cables are already filled to their physical capacity and cannot accommodate any additional conventional cables. In addition, adding new conduits requires excavation to expand existing corridors or create new corridors, which are costly and disruptive undertakings.


• | Efficiency. Most overhead lines and underground cables use traditional conductors such as copper and aluminum, which lose power due to electrical resistance. At transmission voltage, electrical losses average about 7% in the United States and other developed nations, but can exceed 20% in some locations due to the distance of the line, quality of conductor, and the power grid’s architecture and characteristics, among other factors.


• | Security. Catastrophic equipment failures caused by aging equipment, physical and cyber threats, and weather related disasters can leave entire sections of an urban environment without power for hours or days. It can be difficult to recover 

6

from extended power outages in urban load centers, worsening situations where the personal safety of residents and the economic health of business are threatened.
Our solutions for the grid market
We address these challenges in the grid market by providing services and solutions designed to increase the power grid’s capacity, reliability, security and efficiency.  We also provide advanced ship protection equipment for the U.S Navy in this segment as each Navy ship can be thought of as having its own power grid.  Our solutions include:

• | Superconductor Wire and Applications. Conventional conductors of electricity, such as aluminum and copper wire, lose energy due to resistance. Using a compound of yttrium barium copper oxide (“YBCO”), we manufacture and provide high-temperature superconductor (“HTS”) wire that can conduct many times more electricity than conventional conductors with minimal power loss. We have developed full system solutions that we sell and expect to continue to sell directly to customers. This business model leverages our applications expertise, drives value beyond the wire and enables us to recognize revenue and take ownership over the marketing and sales of the full systems. These systems include: 


o | Resilient Electric Grid ("REG") Systems. Our REG system has two primary applications that increase the reliability and the capacity of the urban infrastructure. For applications focused on reliability improvement, the REG cable is best used in a “ring” or “loop” configuration to interconnect nearby urban substations. This enables urban utilities to share transmission connections and excess station capacity, while controlling the high fault currents that naturally result from such interconnections, providing protection against the adverse effects that follow the loss of critical substation facilities in urban areas. We believe a utility installing our REG system could double its reliability (e.g. N-1 to N-2, or greater) by networking substations, which is a solution utilities would generally not consider when using conventional technology due to the disruptive nature and economic disadvantages of conventional technology in urban settings. For applications focused on capacity improvement, the REG cable can be used in a “branch” configuration. In this application, the REG cable connects an existing large urban substation with a new, much smaller, and more simplified substation within the city at a lower cost. The smaller urban substation does not need large power transformers and takes up much less space, thereby significantly reducing real estate, construction, and other related costs in the urban area. The key component to the REG system is a breakthrough cable system that combines very high power handling capacity with fault current limiting characteristics, features that are attributable to our proprietary HTS wire, which we believe allows leaking, aged oil-cooled cables to be replaced with environmentally benign, nitrogen cooled cables. Assuming all urban substations in major cities in the U.S. could be connected with our REG system, we believe the total annual addressable market is approximately $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion. 


o | Ship Protection Systems. The primary focus of our ship protection systems (“SPS”) has been degaussing systems. These systems reduce a naval ship’s magnetic signature, making it much more difficult for a mine to detect and damage a ship. Traditionally made of heavy copper wire, degaussing is required on all U.S. Navy combat ships. Our HTS advanced degaussing system is lightweight, compact, and often outperforms its conventional counterpart. This HTS system is estimated to enable a 50 to 80 percent reduction in total degaussing system weight, offering significant potential for fuel savings or options to add different payloads. The core components of a degaussing system are transferable to other applications being targeted for ship implementation. We are also continuing to work on expanding HTS technology into the fleet through a variety of applications for power, propulsion, and protection equipment. Our SPS has been designed into the San Antonio class of amphibious assault vessels. We are also seeking opportunities to propagate SPS throughout the surface fleet, creating a relatively long-term revenue steam. We estimate that the total addressable market for HTS-based, ship protection systems for the marine market to be between $70.0 million and $120.0 million per year between the years 2020 and 2025. 


• | FACTS Systems. Flexible alternating current transmission system – or FACTS – is a system that consists of power electronics and other static components used for controlling power flow and voltage in the AC transmission system. FACTS products aim to increase controllability and power transferability of a network, which allows more effective utilization of existing assets, and reduces the need for new transmission lines and facilities to increase electricity availability. Our FACTS sales process begins with our group of experienced transmission planners working with power grid operators, renewable energy developers, and industrial system operators to identify power 

7

grid constraints and determine how our solutions might improve network performance.  These services often lead to sales of grid interconnection solutions for wind farms and solar power plants, power quality systems for utilities and heavy industrial operations and transmission and distribution cable systems.  Our transmission planners work with our customers on the following solutions:

o | D-VAR® Systems. The power that flows through AC networks comprises both real power, measured in watts, and reactive power, measured in Volt Amp Reactive (“VARs”). In simple terms, reactive power is required to support voltage in the power network. D-VAR systems can provide the reactive power needed to stabilize voltage on the grid. These systems also can be used to connect wind farms and solar power plants to the power grid seamlessly as well as to protect certain industrial facilities against voltage swells and sags. We estimate the annual addressable market for FACTS systems such as D-VAR (excluding D-VAR VVO "VVO") to be approximately $600 million. 


o | D-VAR® VVO. We believe D-VAR VVO will allow us to enter the market for products to serve the distribution power grid. VVO is designed to be a direct-connect 15 kilovolt class power quality system for a utility's distribution network to optimally control voltage as distribution networks are increasingly impacted by distributed generation, such as roof top and community solar. We believe VVO has the potential to save utilities time and money by avoiding costly options to increase the reliability and resiliency of the distribution grid and to allow utilities to build a "plug 'n play" network to serve the demands of modern energy consumers. The intended target markets of VVO are electric distribution grids incorporating distributed generation, including where utility grid modernization attributes such as the following are applicable: mandated efficiency upgrades, mass adoption of rooftop solar, community solar, utility-owned micro-girds, variable load conditions on the distribution grid and voltage regulations alternatives. AMSC estimates the annual addressable market for VVO to be approximately $600 million.


• | We are also offering full system solutions through a collaboration with industry leader Nexans:


o | Stand-alone Fault Current Limiters. Used in substations, superconductor fault current limiters (“SFCLs”) act as surge protectors for the power grid. SFCLs can help protect the grid by reducing the destructive nature of faults, extending the life of existing substation equipment and allowing utilities to defer or eliminate equipment replacements or upgrades. Together with Nexans, we offer SFCLs for medium voltage alternating current (“AC”) networks. 

Core Technologies
Superconductors
Our second generation (“2G”) HTS wire technology helps us address the smart grid infrastructure market opportunity by providing components and solutions designed to increase the power grid’s capacity, reliability, security and efficiency. Our wire, known as Amperium wire, conducts electricity with zero resistance below about -297 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, our 2G wire has the ability to switch to a resistive state whenever a fault current exceeds a predetermined value.  This characteristic is a key enabler to our REG system. The technology can be used in many applications including electricity transmission cables, superconducting generators and degaussing systems for naval vessels. Superconductor power cables, which are a class of high-capacity, environmentally-benign, and easy-to-install transmission and distribution cables, address power grid capacity issues by increasing the thermal limit of existing or new corridors.  Superconductor power cables are cylindrically shaped systems consisting of HTS wires (which conduct electricity) surrounded by electrical insulation encased in a metal or polymeric jacket.
Currently, power cables are made primarily using copper wires. Power cables incorporating our Amperium wire are able to carry up to 10 times the electrical current of copper cables of the same diameter. These cable systems also bring efficiency advantages. Traditional cable systems heat up due to the electrical resistance of copper, causing electrical losses. Electrical losses at transmission voltage average about 7% in the United States and other developed nations, but can exceed 20% in some locations due to the distance of the line and the power grid’s architecture and characteristics, among other factors. Conversely, HTS materials can carry direct current (“DC”) with 100% efficiency and AC with nearly 100% efficiency when they are cooled below a critical temperature. As a result, AC HTS power cables lose significantly less power to resistive heating than copper cables, and DC HTS power cables have no energy losses due to resistive heating.
PowerModule Power Converters
8

Our family of PowerModule power electronic converters incorporates power semiconductor devices that switch, control and move large amounts of power faster and with far less disruption than the electromechanical switches historically used. While today our PowerModule systems are used primarily in our ECS and D-VAR systems, they also have been incorporated into electric motor drives, distributed and dispersed generation devices (micro-turbines, fuel cells, and photovoltaics), power quality solutions, batteries, and flywheel-based uninterruptible power supplies.
Research and Development
Our research and development expenses were $11.6 million, $12.5 million and $12.3 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively.
Customers
We have designed wind turbines for, or licensed wind turbine designs to, more than 10 wind turbine manufacturing customers including Inox Wind Limited ("Inox") in India. We have also served over 100 customers in the grid market since our inception, including American Electric Power, Long Island Power Authority, Bonneville Power Administration, M.A. Mortensen Company, Florida Power & Light, and Renewable Energy Systems, LLC in the United States, EDF Group in France, Korean Electric Power Corporation in Korea, SSE plc in the United Kingdom, Consolidated Power Projects (Pty) Ltd in South Africa, and Ergon Energy in Australia. We serve customers globally through a localized sales and field service presence in our core target markets. Additionally, our sales personnel in the United States are supported by manufacturers' sales representatives.
Facilities and Manufacturing
Our primary facilities and their primary functions are as follows:

• | Ayer, Massachusetts — Corporate headquarters, superconductors research, development and manufacturing, FACTS product engineering and manufacturing


• | Pewaukee, Wisconsin — Power electronics and controls research and development


• | Klagenfurt, Austria — Wind turbine engineering


• | Timisoara, Romania — Electrical Control System and PowerModule power converter manufacturing

Our global footprint also includes sales and/or field service offices in Australia, China, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom.
The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company’s products are nickel, silver, yttruim, copper, brass, and stainless steel. Major components are insulated gate bi-polar transistors (IGBTs), heatsinks, inductors, enclosures, transformers, and printed circuit boards. Most of these raw materials are available from multiple sources in the United States and world markets. Generally, the Company believes that adequate alternative sources are available for the majority of its key raw material and purchased component needs, however, the Company is dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers for certain materials or components.
Sales and Marketing
Our strategy is to serve customers locally in our core target markets through a direct sales force operating out of sales offices worldwide. In addition, we utilize manufacturers’ sales representatives in the United States to market our products to utilities in North America.  The sales force also leverages business development staff for our various offerings as well as our team of wind turbine engineers and power grid transmission planners, all of whom help to ensure that we have an in-depth understanding of customer needs and provide cost-effective solutions for those needs.
In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, Inox accounted for 27%, 59% and 62% of our total revenues, respectively, and no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in each of those fiscal years.  
The portion of total revenue recognized from customers located outside the United States was 64%, 78% and 85% for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of the revenue recognized from customers outside the United States, we recognized 42%, 75% and 73% from customers in India for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For additional financial information, see the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein, including Note 18, “Business Segments”.

Our foreign operations, particularly our operations in India and other emerging markets, expose us to a variety of risks.  For a discussion of additional risks associated with our foreign operations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – We have operations in, and that depend on sales in, emerging markets, including India, and global conditions could negatively affect our operating results or limit our ability to expand our operations outside of these markets.  Changes in India’s political, social, regulatory and economic environment may affect our financial performance.”
Backlog
We had backlog at March 31, 2018 of approximately $43.6 million considering the most updated information known as of the date of this filing, from government and commercial customers, compared to $65.6 million at March 31, 2017. Current backlog represents the value of contracts and purchase orders received for which delivery is expected during the next twelve months based on contractually agreed-upon terms.  The year-over-year decrease in backlog is driven by lower backlog in the Wind business unit.  See Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation”, for further discussion of the strategic agreements entered into with Inox.
Competition
We face competition in various aspects of our technology and product development. We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace depends upon several factors, including technical innovation, range of products and services, product quality and reliability, customer service and technical support.
Wind
We face competition from companies offering power electronic converters for use in applications for which we expect to sell our PowerModule products. These companies include ABB, Hopewind, Semikron, Vacon, and Xantrex (a subsidiary of Schneider Electric).
We face competition from companies offering various types of wind turbine electrical system components, which include ABB, Ingeteam, Mita-Teknik, and Woodward. We also face indirect competition in the wind energy market from global manufacturers of wind turbines, such as Gamesa, General Electric, Suzlon, and Vestas.
We face competition for the supply of wind turbine engineering design services from design engineering firms such as Aerodyn.
Grid
We face competition from other companies offering FACTS systems similar to our D-VAR products. These include static var compensators (“SVCs”) from ABB, General Electric, AREVA, Mitsubishi Electric, and Siemens; adaptive VAR compensators and STATCOMs produced by ABB and Siemens; Dynamic voltage restorers (“DVRs”) produced by companies such as ABB; and flywheels and battery-based uninterruptable power supply (“UPS”) systems offered by various companies around the world.
We face competition both from suppliers of traditional utility solutions and from companies who are developing HTS wires. We also face competition for our Amperium wire from a number of companies in the United States and abroad. These include Superconductor Technologies and Superpower (a subsidiary of Furukawa) in the United States; Fujikura and Sumitomo in Japan; SuNAM in South Korea; BASF Corporation in Europe (“BASF”), Innova and Shanghai Creative Superconductor in China; and SuperOx in Russia. With our HTS-based REG product, we are offering a new approach that provides alternatives to utilities for power system design. Therefore, we believe that we compete with traditional approaches such as new full-sized substations, overhead and underground transmission, and urban power transformers.
We believe we are currently the only company that can offer HTS-based SPS products that have been fully qualified for use aboard U.S. Navy surface combatants.  Therefore, the primary competition for our SPS products is currently coming from defense contractors that provide the copper-based systems that our lighter, more efficient HTS versions have been developed to replace.  Companies such as L3, Excelis, Raytheon, and Textron have the bulk of the copper-based business today.  However, over time, as the HTS-based SPS proliferate to the fleet, companies that have the capability to manufacture and/or package HTS wire into robust, turn-key systems will likely attempt to duplicate our products, and thus additional competition is expected from more traditional HTS competitors such as those listed above.
10

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, research and development, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. In addition, as our target markets develop, other large industrial companies may enter these fields and compete with us.
Patents, licenses and trade secrets
Patent Background
An important part of our business strategy is to develop a strong worldwide patent position in all of our technology areas. Our intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio includes both patents we own and patents we license from others. We devote substantial resources to building a strong patent position. As of March 31, 2018, we owned (either solely or jointly) 90 U.S. patents and had 9 U.S. patent applications on file. We also hold licenses from third parties covering more than 40 issued U.S. patents and patent applications. Together with the international counterparts of each of these patents and patent applications, we own over 380 patents and patent applications worldwide, and have rights through exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to approximately 115 additional patents and patent applications. We believe that our current patent position, together with our ability to obtain licenses from other parties to the extent necessary, will provide us with sufficient proprietary rights to develop and sell our products. However, for the reasons described below, we cannot assure you that this will be the case.
Despite the strength of our patent position, a number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications of third parties relate to our current products, to products we are developing, or to technology we are now using in the development or production of our products. We may need to acquire licenses to those patents, contest the scope or validity of those patents, or design around patented processes or applications as necessary. If companies holding patents or patent applications that we need to license are competitors, we believe the strength of our patent portfolio will significantly improve our ability to enter into license or cross-license arrangements with these companies. We have already successfully negotiated cross-licenses with several competitors. We may be required to obtain licenses to some patents and patent applications held by companies or other institutions, such as national laboratories or universities, not directly competing with us. Those organizations may not be interested in cross-licensing or, if willing to grant licenses, may charge unreasonable royalties. We have successfully obtained licenses related to HTS wire from a number of such organizations with royalties we consider reasonable. Based on historical experience, we expect that we will be able to obtain other necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses from competitors on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
Failure to obtain all necessary patents, licenses and other IP rights upon reasonable terms could significantly reduce the scope of our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We do not now know the likelihood of successfully contesting the scope or validity of patents held by others. In any event, we could incur substantial costs in challenging the patents of other companies. Moreover, third parties could challenge some of our patents or patent applications, and we could incur substantial costs in defending the scope and validity of our own patents or patent applications whether or not a challenge is ultimately successful.
Wind and Grid Patents
We have received patents and filed a significant number of additional patent applications on power quality and reliability systems, including our D-VAR products. Our products are covered by almost 60 patents and patents pending worldwide on both our systems and power converter products. The patents and applications focus on inventions that significantly improve product performance and reduce product costs, thereby providing a competitive advantage. One invention of note allows for a reduction in the number of power inverters required in the system by optimally running the inverters in overload mode, thereby significantly reducing overall system costs. Another important invention uses inverters to offset transients due to capacitor bank switching, which provides improved system performance.
Under our Windtec Solutions™ brand, we design a variety of wind turbine systems and license these designs, including expertise and patent rights, to third parties for an upfront fee, plus in some cases, future royalties. Our wind turbine designs are covered by more than 30 patents and patents pending worldwide on wind turbine technology. We have patent coverage on the unique design features of our blade pitch control system, which ensures optimal aerodynamic flow conditions on the turbine blades and improves system efficiency and performance. The pitch system includes a patented SafetyLOCK™ feature that causes the blades to rotate to a feathered position to prevent the rotor blades from spinning during a fault.
We recognize the importance of IP protection in China and believe that China is steadily moving toward recognizing and acting in accordance with international norms for IP. As such, we have incorporated China in our patent strategy for all of our various products. Nevertheless, we recognize that the risk of IP piracy is still higher in China than in most other industrialized countries, and so we are careful to limit the technology we provide through our product sales in China. While we take the steps 
11

necessary to ensure the safety of our IP, we cannot provide any assurance that these measures will be fully successful. For example, see Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” for more information regarding legal proceedings that we have undertaken against Sinovel Wind Group Co., Ltd (“Sinovel”) alleging the illegal use of our intellectual property.
HTS Patents
Since the discovery of high temperature superconductors in 1986, rapid technical advances have characterized the HTS industry, which in turn have resulted in a large number of patents, including overlapping patents, relating to superconductivity. As a result, the patent situation in the field of HTS technology and products is unusually complex. We have obtained licenses to patents and patent applications covering some HTS materials. We currently have non-exclusive rights to a fundamental U.S. patent (U.S. 8,060,169 B1) covering 2G and similar HTS wire and applications and may elect in the future to allow our rights under this license to lapse. However, we may have to obtain additional licenses to HTS materials and, upon expiration of U.S. 8,060,169, to the materials covered by such patent.
We are focusing on the production of our Amperium wire, and we intend to continue to maintain a leadership position in 2G HTS wire through a combination of patents, licenses and proprietary expertise. In addition to our owned patents and patent applications in 2G HTS wire, we have obtained licenses from (i) MIT for the MOD process we use to deposit the YBCO layer, and (ii) Alcatel-Lucent on the YBCO material. During fiscal 2015, we entered into a Joint Development Agreement (“JDA”) and licensed certain of our HTS manufacturing process technology to BASF.  Under the JDA, we agreed with BASF to develop a new solutions-based deposition technology for the interface layers of our Amperium wire.  Should this development effort be successful, any newly developed intellectual property as a result of the JDA will be owned by BASF, but we will have the right to incorporate this new technology into our manufacturing process on a royalty-free basis.  Alternatively, we could purchase HTS wire directly from BASF should they decide to manufacture and sell HTS wire.  If alternative processes become more promising in the future, we also expect to seek to develop a proprietary position in these alternative processes.
We have more than 243 patents and patents pending covering applications of HTS wire, such as HTS fault current limiting technology including our fault current limiting cable, HTS rotating machines and ship protection systems. Since the superconductor rotating machine and the fault current limiting cable applications are relatively new, we are building a particularly strong patent position in these areas. At present, we believe we have the world’s broadest and most fundamental patent position in superconductor rotating machines technology. We have also filed a series of patents on our concept for our proprietary fault current limiting technology. However, there can be no assurance that that these patents will be sufficient to assure our freedom of action in these fields without further licensing from others. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information regarding the status of the commercialization of our Amperium wire products.
Trade Secrets
Some of the important technology used in our operations and products is not covered by any patent or patent application owned by or licensed to us. However, we take steps to maintain the confidentiality of this technology by requiring all employees and all consultants to sign confidentiality agreements and by limiting access to confidential information. We cannot provide any assurance that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of that information. For example, see Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” for more information regarding legal proceedings that we have filed against Sinovel alleging the illegal use of our intellectual property. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that others, including our competitors, will not independently develop the same or comparable technology that is one of our trade secrets.
Employees
As of March 31, 2018, we employed 247 persons. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. 
In April 2017, we announced that our board of directors had approved a plan to reduce our global workforce by approximately 8%, effective April 4, 2017. The majority of the affected employees were located at our Massachusetts office location. The purpose of the workforce reduction was to reduce operating expenses to better align with our current revenues.

1. Nature of the Business and Operations and Liquidity
Nature of the Business and Operations
American Superconductor Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “AMSC” or the “Company”) was founded on April 9, 1987. The Company is a leading provider of megawatt-scale solutions that lower the cost of wind power and enhance the performance of the power grid. In the wind power market, the Company enables manufacturers to field wind turbines through its advanced engineering, support services and power electronics products. In the power grid market, the Company enables electric utilities and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and distribute power through its transmission planning services and power electronics and superconductor-based products. The Company’s wind and power grid products and services provide exceptional reliability, security, efficiency and affordability to its customers.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-K. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue operations and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
Liquidity
The Company has experienced recurring operating losses and as of March 31, 2018, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $988.3 million. In addition, the Company has experienced recurring negative operating cash flows.  At March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $34.1 million. Cash used in operations for the year ended March 31, 2018 was $24.8 million.
From April 1, 2011 through the date of this filing, the Company has reduced its global workforce substantially. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 the Company announced an 8% reduction in force, primarily affecting employees in its Devens, Massachusetts facility, effective April 4, 2017 which led to a $1.5 million restructuring charge during the year ended March 31, 2018. See Note 17 "Restructuring" for further discussion of this action. The Company continues to consolidate certain business operations to reduce facility costs.  As of March 31, 2018, the Company had a global workforce of 247 persons.  The Company plans to closely monitor its expenses and, if required, expects to further reduce operating costs and capital spending to enhance liquidity. 
Over the last several years, the Company has entered into several debt and equity financing arrangements in order to raise capital.  Since April 1, 2012, the Company has generated aggregate cash flows from financing activities of $85.2 million, including net proceeds of $2.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 from the Company's At Market Issuance Sales Agreement ("ATM") with FBR Capital Markets & Co.  In addition, on May 10, 2017, the Company completed an additional equity offering, which generated net proceeds of approximately $17.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company terminated the ATM in conjunction with this equity offering. See Note 11, “Debt”, and Note 14 “Stockholders’ Equity” for further discussion of these financing arrangements. 
On February 5, 2018, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “PSA”) with 64 Jackson, LLC (the “Purchaser”) and Stewart Title Guaranty Company (“Escrow Agent”), to effectuate the sale of certain real property located at 64 Jackson Road, Devens, Massachusetts, including the building that has served as the Company’s headquarters (collectively, the “Property”), in exchange for total consideration of $23.0 million, composed of (i) cash consideration of $17.0 million, and (ii) a $6.0 million subordinated secured commercial promissory note payable to the Company (the "Seller Note"). Subsequently, the Seller, the Purchaser and Jackson 64 MGI, LLC (“Assignee”) entered into an Assignment of Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”), pursuant to which the Purchaser assigned all of its rights and interests in the PSA to the Assignee and the Assignee agreed to assume all of the Purchaser’s obligations and liabilities under the PSA. The transaction closed on March 28, 2018, at which time the Company received, from the Assignee, cash consideration, net of certain agreed upon closing costs, of $16.9 million, and the Seller Note at an interest rate of 1.96%. The Seller Note is secured by a subordinated second mortgage on the Property and a subordinated second assignment of leases and rents.
In December 2015, the Company entered into a set of strategic agreements valued at approximately $210.0 million with Inox, which includes a multi-year supply contract pursuant to which the Company will supply electric control systems to Inox Wind Ltd. (“Inox”) and a license agreement allowing Inox to manufacture a limited number of electrical control systems until Inox purchases the specified number of electrical control systems required under the terms of the supply contract.  After Inox purchases the specified number of electrical control systems required under the terms of the supply contract, Inox agreed that the Company will continue as Inox’s preferred supplier and Inox will be required to purchase from the Company a majority of its electric control systems requirements for an additional three-year period. 
57

The Company believes based on the information presented above, and its annual management assessment, that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and capital expenditures for the next twelve months following the issuance of the financial statements.  The Company’s liquidity is highly dependent on its ability to increase revenues, its ability to control its operating costs, and its ability to raise additional capital, if necessary.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to raise additional capital from other sources or execute on any other means of improving liquidity described above.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications of prior years’ amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income, cash flows from operating activities or stockholders’ equity.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, collectability of receivables, realizability of inventory, goodwill and intangible assets, warranty provisions, stock-based compensation, valuation of warrant and derivative liabilities, tax reserves, and deferred tax assets. Provisions for depreciation are based on their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Some of these estimates can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While for any given estimate or assumption made by the Company’s management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable, the Company believes that, given the current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements.
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less that are regarded as high quality, low risk investments and are measured using such inputs as quoted prices, and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Cash equivalents consist principally of certificates of deposits and money market accounts.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consist of amounts owed by commercial companies and government agencies. Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company’s accounts receivable relate principally to a limited number of customers. As of March 31, 2018, Inox accounted for approximately 32% and Fuji Bridex Pte Ltd for approximately 17% of the Company’s total receivable balance, with no other customer accounting for greater than 10% of the balance.  As of March 31, 2017, Inox accounted for approximately 52% and SSE plc for approximately 17% of the Company’s total receivable balance, with no other customer accounting for greater than 10% of the balance. Changes in the financial condition or operations of the Company’s customers may result in delayed payments or non-payments which would adversely impact its cash flows from operating activities and/or its results of operations. As such, the Company may require collateral, advanced payment or other security based upon the customer history and/or creditworthiness. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based primarily on the probability of recoverability based on historical collection and write-off experience, the age of past due receivables, specific customer circumstances, and current economic trends. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment, additional allowances may be required. Failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Inventory
Inventories include material, direct labor and related manufacturing overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value determined on a first-in, first-out basis as the estimated selling prices in the 
58

ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.. The Company records inventory when it takes delivery and title to the product according to the terms of each supply contract.
Program costs may be deferred and recorded as inventory on contracts on which costs are incurred in excess of approved contractual amounts and/or funding, if future recovery of the costs is deemed probable.
At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. Inventories that management considers excess or obsolete are reserved. Management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining excess and obsolescence and net realizable value adjustments. Once inventory is written down and a new cost basis is established, it is not written back up if demand increases.
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded inventory reserves of approximately $0.4 million, $1.6 million, and $2.7 million, respectively, based on evaluating its ending inventory on hand for excess quantities and obsolescence. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company recorded benefits of $0.7 million, $1.4 million, and $5.0 million, respectively, for the usage of inventories previously reserved.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company accounts for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Asset Classification | Estimated Useful Life in Years 
Building | 40 
Process upgrades to the building | 10-40 
Machinery and equipment | 3-10 
Furniture and fixtures | 3-5 
Leasehold improvements | Shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition of assets, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, consisting principally of fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets, for potential impairment. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the treatment of long-lived assets, the Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets or asset group that is held and used, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Under the held and used approach, the asset or asset group to be tested for impairment should represent the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
On April 3, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a plan to reduce the Company's global workforce by approximately 8%, effective April 4, 2017, primarily in its Devens, Massachusetts facility. The Board of Directors also approved a move from the Company's previously owned 355,000 square-foot facility in Devens, Massachusetts to a smaller facility better suited for its 2G wire process and systems manufacturing. Since the restructuring activities impacted its Superconductor and Corporate asset groups, the Company concluded that there were indicators of potential impairment of its long-lived assets that required further analysis for these assets groups as of March 31, 2017. The Company conducted assessments of the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the pre-tax undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets over their remaining book useful lives. Based on the calculations performed by management, the sum of the undiscounted cash flows forecasted to be generated by certain assets were less than the carrying value of those assets. Therefore, there were indicators that certain of its assets were impaired and the Company performed additional analysis. An evaluation of the level of impairment 
59

was made by comparing the fair value of the definite long-lived tangible and intangible assets of its reporting units against their carrying values.
The fair values for the impacted property and equipment were based on what the Company could reasonably expect to sell each asset for from the perspective of a market participant. The determination of the fair value of its property and equipment includes estimates and judgments regarding marketability and ultimate sales price of individual assets. The Company utilized market data and approximations from comparable analyses to arrive at the fair value of the impacted property and equipment. The fair values of the amortizable intangible assets related to core technology and trade names were determined using primarily the relief-from-royalty method over the estimated economic lives of these assets from a perspective of a market participant. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, the Company determined that the long-lived assets for the Superconductor and Corporate asset groups were not impaired as the estimated fair values exceeded the carrying values. There were no indicators requiring further impairment testing on the Company's long-lived assets during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets of acquired businesses that are consolidated. The Company performs its annual assessment of goodwill on February 28th each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances or a triggering event indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Determining whether a triggering event has occurred often involves significant judgment from management. An entity is permitted to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test. The quantitative impairment test is required only if the entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit based on an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow adjusted for entity specific factors. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an entity should consider the totality of all relevant events or circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying amount of a reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded. See Note 3, "Acquisition and Related Goodwill" for further information and discussion.
The Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill on February 28, 2018 and noted no triggering events from the analysis date to March 31, 2018 and determined that there was no impairment to goodwill.   
Equity Method Investments
The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in entities in which it has an ownership interest, but does not exercise a controlling interest in the operating and financial policies of an investee. Under this method, an investment is carried at the acquisition cost, plus the Company’s equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition.
The Company periodically tests its investments for potential impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate a loss in the fair value of the investments may be other than temporary.  During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company sold its investment and recorded an impairment charge of $0.7 million on its investment in Tres Amigas.  There were no minority investments as of March 31, 2018 or 2017. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes revenue for product sales upon customer acceptance, which can occur at the time of delivery, installation or post-installation where applicable, provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and the collectability is reasonably assured. Existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors. If it is determined during the arrangement that collectability is not reasonably assured, revenue is recognized on a cash basis of accounting. Certain of the Company’s contracts involve retention amounts which are contingent upon meeting certain performance requirements through the expiration of the contract warranty periods. For contractual arrangements that involve retention, the Company recognizes revenue for these amounts upon the expiration of the warranty period, meeting the performance requirements and when collection of the fee is reasonably assured.
For certain arrangements, such as contracts to perform research and development, prototype development contracts and certain product sales, the Company records revenues using the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs. Percentage-of-completion revenue recognition accounting is predominantly used on certain turnkey power systems installations for electric utilities and long-term prototype development contracts with the U.S. government. The Company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made. However, the ability to reliably estimate total costs at completion is challenging, especially on long-term prototype development contracts, and could result in future changes in contract estimates. For contracts 
60

where reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs cannot be made, the Company follows the completed-contract method.
The Company enters into sales arrangements that may provide for multiple deliverables to a customer. Sales of certain products may include extended warranty and support or service packages, and at times include performance bonds. As these contracts progress, the Company continually assesses the probability of a payout from the performance bond. Should the Company determine that such a payout is likely; the Company would record a liability. The Company would reduce revenue to the extent a liability is recorded. In addition, the Company enters into licensing arrangements that include training services.
Deliverables are separated into more than one unit of accounting when (1) the delivered element(s) have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, and (2) delivery of the undelivered element(s) is probable and substantially in the control of the Company.  In general, revenues are separated between the different product shipments which have stand-alone value, and the various services to be provided. Revenue for product shipments is recognized in accordance with the Company’s policy for product sales, while revenues for the services are recognized over the period of performance. The Company identifies all goods and/or services that are to be delivered separately under a sales arrangement and allocates revenue to each deliverable based on the element’s fair value as determined by vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), which is the price charged when that element is sold separately, or third-party evidence (“TPE”). When VSOE and TPE are unavailable, fair value is based on the Company’s best estimate of selling price utilizing a cost plus reasonable margin consistent with how the Company has set pricing historically for similar products and services. When the Company’s estimates are used to determine fair value, management makes its estimates using reasonable and objective evidence to determine the price. The Company reviews VSOE and TPE at least annually. If the Company concludes it is unable to establish fair values for one or more undelivered elements within a multiple-element arrangement using VSOE then the Company uses TPE or the best estimate of the selling price for that unit of accounting, being the price at which the vendor would transact if the unit of accounting were sold by the vendor regularly on a standalone basis.
The Company’s license agreements provide either for the payment of contractually determined paid-up front license fees or milestone based payments in consideration for the grant of rights to manufacture and or sell products using its patented technologies or know-how. Some of these agreements provide for the release of the licensee from intellectual property infringements past and future claims. When the Company can determine that it has no further obligations other than the grant of the license and that the Company has fully transferred the technology know-how, the Company recognizes the revenue under a completed contract model. In other license arrangements, the Company may also agree to provide training services to transfer the technology know-how.  In these arrangements, the Company has determined that the licenses have no standalone value to the customer and are not separable from training services as the Company can only fully transfer the technology know-how through the training component. Accordingly, the Company accounts for these arrangements as a single unit of accounting, and recognizes revenue over the period of its performance and milestones that have been achieved. Costs for these arrangements are expensed as incurred.
In December 2015, the Company entered into a set of strategic agreements valued at approximately $210.0 million with Inox, which includes a multi-year supply contract pursuant to which the Company will supply electric control systems to Inox and a license agreement allowing Inox to manufacture a limited number of electrical control systems until Inox purchases the specified number of electrical control systems required under the terms of the supply contract.  The Company determined this license has standalone value to the customer and can be separated from the supply contract.  The license agreement includes customer acceptance criteria to demonstrate that the know-how to manufacture the electrical control systems has been fully transferred. The Company is deferring recognition of the revenue allocable to the license until this acceptance criteria have been met.
In March 2016, the Company entered into a set of agreements to jointly develop an advanced, low-cost manufacturing process for second generation high temperature superconductor wire with BASF. Under the joint development agreement, the Company’s manufacturing know-how for its Amperium® superconductor wire and BASF's chemical solution deposition production technology will be combined. As part of the agreements, the Company also entered into a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license under which the Company agreed to provide BASF a specified portion of its second generation (2G) high temperature superconductor (HTS) wire manufacturing technology.  The Company determined that the license rights it provides to BASF have standalone value from the ongoing joint development effort. The Company transferred the license rights to BASF in March 2016 recording $3.0 million of license revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 as there were no remaining obligations associated with these rights. Any newly developed intellectual property as a result of the joint development will be owned by BASF.  Should this development effort be successful, the Company has the right to incorporate this new technology into its manufacturing process on a royalty-free basis. BASF has also agreed to make guaranteed annual payments to the Company through fiscal 2017 and has an option to continue the joint development through fiscal 2018. The Company is recording revenue for the research and development services being provided over the term of the arrangement.
61

Infrequently, the Company receives requests from customers to hold product being purchased from us for a valid business purpose. The Company recognizes revenue for such arrangements provided the transaction meets, at a minimum, the following criteria: a valid business purpose for the arrangement exists; risk of ownership of the purchased product has been transferred to the buyer; there is a fixed delivery date that is reasonable and consistent with the buyer’s business purpose; the product is ready for shipment; the Company has no continuing performance obligation in regards to the product and the products have been segregated from our inventories and cannot be used to fill other orders received. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 such transactions in revenue were $3.7 million. There were no such transactions in revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 or 2016.
The Company has elected to record taxes collected from customers on a net basis and does not include tax amounts in revenue or costs of revenue.
Customer deposits received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue until customer acceptance is received. Deferred revenue also represents the amount billed to and/or collected from commercial and government customers on contracts which permit billings to occur in advance of contract performance/revenue recognition.
On April 1, 2018 the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). For further discussion regarding the changes and financial impact of adopting Topic 606 see Note 20, Recent Accounting Pronouncements.
Product Warranty
Warranty obligations are incurred in connection with the sale of the Company’s products. The Company generally provides a one to three year warranty on its products, commencing upon installation. The costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale. Future warranty costs are estimated based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products. The accounting estimate related to product warranty involves judgment in determining future estimated warranty costs. Should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes
The Company’s provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each fiscal year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company has provided a valuation allowance against its U.S. and certain foreign deferred income tax assets since the Company believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets are not currently realizable due to uncertainty around profitability in the future.
Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. The Company includes interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes.  See Note 13, “Income Taxes,” for further information regarding its income tax assumptions and expenses.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("the Act") was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 34% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings. The 
62

Company has calculated its best estimate of the impact of the Act in the year end income tax provision in accordance with the Company's understanding of the Act and guidance available at the time of this filing. The Company has calculated a provisional estimate of the impact of the Act in our year end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the Act and guidance available of this filing. See Note 13, “Income Taxes,” for further information regarding its income tax assumptions and expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based payment transactions using a fair value-based method and recognizes the related expense in the results of operations.
Stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of awards with service and performance conditions. For awards with service conditions only, the Company recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service/vesting period. For awards with performance conditions, accruals of compensation cost are made based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. The cumulative effect of changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur.
Determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatilities of the Company’s common stock and expected terms. The expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical and implied volatilities of the Company’s common stock. The expected term represents the average time that the options that vest are expected to be outstanding based on the vesting provisions and the Company’s historical exercise, cancellation and expiration patterns.
The Company estimates pre-vesting forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense based on historical and forward-looking factors. Changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant, unanticipated increases or decreases in stock-based compensation expense from period to period. The termination of employment of certain employees who hold large numbers of stock-based awards may also have a significant, unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and, therefore, on stock-based compensation expense. The Company will update these assumptions on at least an annual basis and on an interim basis if significant changes to the assumptions are warranted.
The Company's adoption of ASU 2016-09 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting on April 1, 2016 also resulted in the prospective classification of excess tax benefits as cash flows from operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes within the consolidated statements of cash flows. Based on the prospective method of adoption chosen, the classification of excess tax benefits within the consolidated statements of cash flows for prior periods presented has not been adjusted to reflect the change.
Computation of Net Loss per Common Share
Basic net loss per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Common equivalent shares include the effect of restricted stock, exercise of stock options and warrants and contingently issuable shares. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, common equivalent shares of 1,157,895, 1,538,418, and 1,552,959, respectively, were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as they were considered antidilutive. The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators of the EPS calculation for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands except per share amounts):

Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of all the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, except for AMSC Austria, for which the local currency (Euro) is the functional currency, and AMSC China, for which the local currency (Renminbi) is the functional currency. The assets and liabilities of AMSC Austria and AMSC China are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are excluded from net loss and shown as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Net foreign currency gains (losses) are included in net loss and were ($2.8) million, $0.1 million, and ($2.3) million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company has no restrictions on the foreign exchange activities of its foreign subsidiaries, including the payment of dividends and other distributions.
Risks and Uncertainties
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and would impact future results of operations and cash flows.
The Company invests its available cash in high credit, quality financial instruments and invests primarily in investment-grade marketable securities, including, but not limited to, government obligations, money market funds and corporate debt instruments.
Several of the Company’s government contracts are being funded incrementally, and as such, are subject to the future authorization, appropriation, and availability of government funding. The Company has a history of successfully obtaining financing under incrementally-funded contracts with the U.S. government and it expects to continue to receive additional contract modifications in the year ending March 31, 2019 and beyond as incremental funding is authorized and appropriated by the government.
Contingencies
From time to time, the Company may be involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. The Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management reviews these estimates in each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. If, with respect to a matter, it is not both probable to result in liability and the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, an estimate of possible loss or range of loss is disclosed unless such an estimate cannot be made. The Company does not recognize gain contingencies until they are realized. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. See Note 15, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for further information regarding the Company’s pending litigation.
Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, warrants to purchase shares of common stock, derivatives, and a senior secured term loan. The carrying 
64

amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term debt, accounts payable, and accrued expenses due to their short nature approximate fair value at March 31, 2018 and 2017. The estimated fair values have been determined through information obtained from market sources and management estimates.  The fair value for the warrant arrangements has been estimated by management based on the terms that it believes it could obtain in the current market for debt with the same terms and similar maturities.  The Company classifies the estimates used to fair value these instruments as Level 3 inputs See Note 4, “Fair Value Measurements” for a full discussion on fair value measurements.


3. Acquisition and Related Goodwill
Acquisition of Infinia Technology Corporation
On September 25, 2017, the Company acquired Infinia Technology Corporation ("ITC") for approximately $3.8 million as described below (the "Acquisition"). Located in Richmond, Washington, ITC is a technology firm founded in 2009 specializing in the design, development and commercialization of cryo-coolers for a wide range of applications. 
Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement ("SPA"), the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of ITC (the "ITC Shares") from the selling stockholders, for a purchase price of approximately $3.8 million consisting of $0.1 million in cash and 884,890 shares of the Company’s common stock (the "AMSC Shares"), $0.01 par value per share at a per share price of $4.02 on the acquisition date. Under the terms of the SPA, the Company was obligated to file a registration statement (the "Resale Registration Statement") covering the resale of the AMSC Shares by the selling stockholders no later than 10 business days following the closing of the Acquisition, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Resale Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable thereafter. Additionally, the Company agreed to pay the selling stockholders an amount in cash (the "Make Whole Payment"), if any, equal to (x) an amount equal to (i) the price per AMSC Share pursuant to the terms of the SPA, multiplied by (ii) the number of AMSC Shares sold by the selling stockholders during the first 90 days after the effectiveness of the Resale Registration Statement, minus (y) the aggregate sales proceeds received by the Selling Stockholders from the sale of any AMSC Shares during the first 90 days after the effectiveness of the Resale Registration Statement. The Resale Registration Statement was declared effective on October 23, 2017. The contingent liability related to the Make Whole Payment was determined under a fair value option based pricing model to be $0.6 million on September 25, 2017 and was subsequently reassessed at each period end until the final amount due of $0.7 million as of December 31, 2017 was determined according to the agreed upon formula. See Note 4 "Fair Value Measurements" and Note 12 "Warrants and Derivative Liabilities" for further discussion regarding the valuation of this liability. On January 5, 2018, the Company settled the Make Whole Payment to the selling stockholders in the amount of $0.7 million.
 ITC was integrated into the Company's Grid business unit. The Acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of Acquisition. The Company estimated the fair value of the intangible assets at $3.4 million, which consisted of core-technology and know-how, working capital of $0.2 million and property, plant and equipment of less than $0.1 million. A long-term deferred tax liability of $1.1 million was recorded for the differing book and tax bases of the ITC assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2018. 
The following table summarizes the consideration paid for ITC and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition date, as well as the fair value at the acquisition date (in millions):
65


 | September 25, 2017
Consideration | 
Cash | $ | 0.1
Equity (884,890 shares of common stock at $4.02 per share) | 3.6 | 
Contingent consideration | 0.6 | 
Total Consideration | $ | 4.3
Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed | 
Core technology and know-how | $ | 3.4
Working capital | 0.2 | 
Property, plant and equipment | 0.0 | 
Total identifiable net assets | $ | 3.6
Long-term deferred tax liability | 1.1 | 
Goodwill recognized | $ | 1.7

At the Acquisition date, the Company valued the Acquisition at $4.2 million (excluding Acquisition costs), using a value of $4.02 per share, which was the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of Acquisition plus $0.1 million in cash and including $0.6 million of contingent consideration for the Make Whole Payment valued as of the closing date. Acquisition costs of less than $0.1 million were recorded in selling, general and administrative costs. 
The results of ITC's operations, which were not significant from the date of acquisition until March 31, 2018, are included in the Company’s consolidated results from the date of Acquisition of September 25, 2017 through the fiscal year end of March 31, 2018. Assuming the Acquisition had occurred on April 1, 2017 and 2016, the impact on the consolidated results of the Company would not have been significant.
Goodwill
At the time of the Acquisition, the Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of Acquisition. The excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired of $1.7 million has been recorded as goodwill in the Company's Grid segment. Goodwill represents the value associated with the acquired workforce and synergies related to the merger of the two companies. 
The guidance under ASC 805-30 provides for the recognition of goodwill on the Acquisition date measured as the excess of the aggregate consideration transferred over the net of the Acquisition date amounts of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the contingent consideration included in the total consideration transferred was determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model, and all other consideration transferred was calculated using its observable market fair value. The tangible net assets acquired fair value was based on observable market fair value. The acquired intangible asset fair value was determined using discounted cash flows under an excess in earnings model. 
The Company determined that it has one reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated - Ship Protection Systems ("SPS"). Goodwill of $1.7 million as of March 31, 2018 is a result of acquiring ITC on September 25, 2017. The Acquisition provides technology supporting the Company's efforts with the U.S. Navy and SPS products. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, the determination of appropriate market comparables as well as the fair value of individual assets and liabilities. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test to establish a fair value baseline for the SPS reporting unit. The Company used an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method, to establish the fair value of the SPS reporting unit and compared it to the carrying value of the reporting unit. Significant estimates and judgments were involved in this assessment. Those estimates and judgments include financial projections, discount rates, tax rates and other related assumptions. 
It was determined that the fair value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit, therefore the Company did not need to record an impairment loss. The Company did not identify any triggering 
66

events in the period between the annual impairment assessment date and March 31, 2018, which would require subsequent testing of goodwill.
4. Fair Value Measurements
A valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value has been established. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:

Level 1 | - | Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
Level 2 | - | Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).
Level 3 | - | Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company develops these inputs based on the best information available, including its own data. 

The Company provides a gross presentation of activity within Level 3 measurement roll-forward and details of transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 measurements.  A change in the hierarchy of an investment from its current level is reflected in the period during which the pricing methodology of such investment changes.  Disclosure of the transfer of securities from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 3 is made in the event that the related security is significant to total cash and investments.  The Company did not have any transfers of assets and liabilities from Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the year ended March 31, 2018. 
A financial asset’s or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis, measured as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):

Valuation Techniques
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less that are regarded as high quality, low risk investments and are measured using such inputs as quoted prices, and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Cash equivalents consist principally of certificates of deposits and money market accounts.
Warrants
Warrants were issued in conjunction with a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Capital Ventures International (“CVI”), an equity offering to Hudson Bay Capital in November 2014, and a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (“Hercules”). Warrants issued to CVI expired on October 4, 2017. See Note 11, “Debt,” and Note 12 “Warrants and Derivative Liabilities,” for additional information. These warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date, and any change in fair value will be recorded as a change in fair value in derivatives and warrants until the earlier of their exercise or expiration.
The Company relies on various assumptions in a lattice model to determine the fair value of warrants. The Company has valued the warrants within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. See Note 12, “Warrants and Derivative Liabilities,” for a discussion of the warrants and the valuation assumptions used.

68

The Company recorded inventory write-downs of $0.4 million and $1.6 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  These write downs were based on evaluating its inventory on hand for excess quantities and obsolescence.
Deferred program costs as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 primarily represent costs incurred on programs accounted for under contract accounting where the Company needs to complete development milestones before revenue and costs will be recognized.

7. Note Receivable
AMSC entered into a purchase and sale agreement dated February 1, 2018 for the Devens facility (including land, building and building improvements) located at 64 Jackson Road, Devens, Massachusetts to 64 Jackson Road, LLC, a limited liability company, in the amount of $23.0 million. The terms for payment included a $1.0 million security deposit, and a note receivable for $6.0 million payable to AMSC with the remaining cash net of certain adjustments for closing costs at the date of settlement.
The note receivable is due in two $3.0 million installments plus accrued interest at 1.96% rate on March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. The note is subordinate to East Boston Savings Bank's mortgage on the Devens property. The note receivable was discounted to its present value of $5.7 million utilizing a discount rate of 6%, which was based on management’s assessment of what an appropriate loan at current market rate would be. The $0.3 million discount was recorded as an offset to the long term portion of the note receivable, and will be amortized to interest income over the term of the note. In addition, the resulting gain of $0.1 million from the sale of the property will be deferred under the cost recovery method for real estate sales due to the subordination of the note receivable. The deferred gain is offset against the long-term portion of the note receivable.

11. Debt
Senior Secured Term Loans
On December 19, 2014, the Company entered into a second amendment with Hercules (the “Hercules Second Amendment”) and entered into a new term loan, borrowing an additional $1.5 million (the “Term Loan C”).  After closing fees and expenses, the net proceeds to the Company for the Term Loan C were $1.4 million.  The Company made interest only payments at an interest rate of 11% through March 16, 2017 when the interest rate was increased to 11.25% until maturity on June 1, 2017, when the loan was repaid in its entirety. 
Hercules received warrants to purchase 13,927 shares of common stock (the “First Warrant”) and 25,641 shares of common stock (the “Second Warrant”) in conjunction with prior term loans that have been repaid in full.  Due to certain adjustment provisions within the warrants, they qualified for liability accounting. The fair value of the warrants, $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, was recorded upon issuance to debt discount and a warrant liability. In conjunction with the Hercules Second Amendment, the First Warrant and Second Warrant were canceled and replaced with the issuance of a new warrant (the “Hercules Warrant”) to purchase 58,823 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.85 per share, subject to certain price-based and other anti-dilution adjustments.  The Hercules Warrant expires on June 30, 2020.  See Note 12, “Warrants and Derivative Liabilities”, for a discussion on the Warrant and the valuation assumptions used.
Interest expense for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, was less than $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, which included less than $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount and payment of the Note in Company common stock at a discount.
12. Warrants and Derivative Liabilities
The Company accounts for its warrants and contingent consideration as liabilities due to certain adjustment provisions within the instruments, which require that they be recorded at fair value. The warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recorded as a change in fair value of warrants until the earlier of its expiration or its exercise at which time the warrant liability will be reclassified to equity. The Company calculated the fair value of the warrants utilizing an integrated lattice model. The contingent consideration is subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recorded as a change in fair value of contingent consideration until the earlier of its settlement or expiration. The Company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing method upon acquisition and as of September 30, 2017. The contingent consideration was settled as of March 31, 2018. See Note 4, "Fair Value Measurements", for further discussion.
71

Senior Convertible Note Warrant
On April 4, 2012, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with CVI. The Purchase Agreement included a warrant to purchase 309,406 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Original Warrant”). Pursuant to an exchange in October 2013, the Original warrant was exchanged for a new warrant (the “Exchanged Warrant”).  The Exchanged Warrant expired on October 4, 2017. 
 Hercules Warrant
On December 19, 2014, the Company entered into the Hercules Second Amendment, (see Note 11, “Debt” for additional information).  In conjunction with the agreement, the Company issued the Hercules Warrant to purchase 58,823 shares of the Company’s common stock.  The Hercules Warrant is exercisable at any time after its issuance at an exercise price of $7.85 per share, subject to certain price-based and other anti-dilution adjustments, including the equity raise in May 2017, the acquisition of ITC with common stock in September 2017 and sales of common stock under the ATM entered into in January 2017, and expires on June 30, 2020.  
November 2014 Warrant
On November 13, 2014, the Company completed an offering of approximately 909,090 units of the Company’s common stock with Hudson Bay Capital.  Each unit consisted of one share of the Company’s common stock and 0.9 of a warrant to purchase one share of common stock, or a warrant to purchase in the aggregate 818,181 shares (the “November 2014 Warrant”).  The November 2014 Warrant is exercisable at any time, at an exercise price equal to $7.81 per share, subject to certain price-based and other anti-dilution adjustments as noted above, and expires on November 13, 2019.  
Following is a summary of the key assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the November 2014 Warrant:

 | March 31, | December 31, | September 30, | June 30, | 
Fiscal Year 2017 | 2018 | 2017 | 2017 | 2017 |

Fair value | $2.6 million | $2.1 million | $1.3 million | $1.8 million | $2.5 million

The Company recorded a net gain, resulting from a decrease in the fair value of the November 2014 Warrant, of $0.7 million, a net gain, resulting from a decrease in the fair value of the November 2014 Warrant, of $1.4 million, and a net loss resulting from an increase in the fair value of the November 2014 Warrant, of $0.1 million to change in fair value of derivatives and warrants in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  
72

The Company prepared its estimates for the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the warrants issued in conjunction with both the Exchanged Note, the repaid term loans, and the November 2014 Warrant utilizing the respective terms of the warrants with similar inputs, as described above.
Contingent Consideration
The Company evaluated the ITC acquisition Make Whole Payment set forth in the SPA, which ultimately required net settlement cash, and determined the contingent consideration qualified for liability classification and derivative treatment under ASC 815. As a result, for each period the fair value of the contingent consideration was remeasured and the resulting gain or loss was recognized in operating expenses.
Following is a summary of the key assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the ITC acquisition:

 | September 30, | | September 25,
Fiscal Year 2017 | 2017 | | 2017 
Risk-free interest rate | 1.09 | % | | 1.09 | %
Expected annual dividend yield | — | | | — | 
Expected volatility | 66.54 | % | | 65.71 | %
Term (years) | 0.31 | | | 0.32 | 
Fair value | $ | 0.4 | | | $ | 0.6

All of the stock related to this liability was sold as of December 5, 2017 and the amount of the Make Whole Payment was calculated to be $0.7 million, and subsequently paid on January 5, 2018. As such, no fair value estimate using a Black-Scholes model was needed as the liability was recorded at the known settlement value for the period ending December 31, 2017. The Company recorded a net loss of $0.1 million resulting from an increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration in the year ended March 31, 2018.

On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law. ASC Topic 740 requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured using the enacted rate for the period in which they are expected to reverse. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides guidance for companies that have not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the Act in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. Accordingly, the new 21% U.S. Federal corporate tax rate was used to measure the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities that will reverse in future periods and the Company recorded a reduction for the change in corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% of $116.3 million to deferred tax assets and the valuation allowance. The Company's deferred tax attributes are generally subject to a full valuation allowance in the U.S. and thus, this adjustment to the attributes did not impact the tax provision. In addition, the new legislation includes a one-time transition tax in which all foreign earnings are deemed to be repatriated to the U.S. and taxable at specified rates included within the Act. The Company reviewed the accumulated foreign earnings aggregated across all non U.S. subsidiaries, net of foreign deficits. The Company believes it is in an aggregate net foreign deficit position for U.S. tax purposes and therefore not liable for the transition tax. The Company made reasonable estimates and does not anticipate significant revisions to the accounting for the tax impact of the Act, but has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of the Act at March 31, 2018. The Company will continue to assess its provision for income taxes as future guidance is issued, but does not currently anticipate significant revisions will be necessary. The ultimate impact may differ from the Company's provisional estimates, possibly materially, due to additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be used and actions the Company may take as a result of the Act. The accounting is expected to be complete within the one year measurement period in accordance with the measurement period guidance outlined in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. 
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation- Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of excess tax benefits in the consolidated statements of cash flows. This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt the new guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 which requires them to reflect any adjustments as of April 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. The Company has not changed the way it accounts for forfeitures. Prior to April 1, 2016, the Company recognized the excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation expense as additional paid-in capital ("APIC"), and tax deficiencies of stock-based compensation expense in the income tax provision or as APIC to the extent that there were sufficient recognized excess tax benefits previously recognized. As a result of the prior guidance that the excess tax benefits reduce taxes payable prior to being recognized as an increase in capital, the Company had not recognized certain deferred tax assets (all tax attributes such as loss ) that could be attributed to tax deductions related to equity compensation in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting. Effective April 1, 2016, the Company early adopted a change in accounting policy in accordance with ASU 2016-09 to account for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit, treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur, and to recognize previously unrecognized deferred 
75

tax assets that arose directly from (or the use of which was postponed by) tax deductions related to equity compensation in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting. No prior periods were restated as a result of this change in accounting policy as the Company previously maintained a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets that could be attributed to equity compensation in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting. As a result of the early adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company recognized an increase to its deferred tax asset of $18.0 million offset by an increase in the Company’s valuation allowance. There was no impact to the Company’s financial statements as a result of the adoption.
The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred income tax assets since it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets are not currently realizable due to the net operating losses incurred by the Company since its inception and net operating losses forecasted in the future. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s valuation allowance decreased by approximately $87.4 million, primarily due to the tax effect of the Company's change in income tax rate from 34% to 21% offset by an increase in the Company’s net operating loss. 
At March 31, 2018, the Company had aggregate net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $871.0 million and $232.0 million, respectively, which expire in the years ending March 31, 2018 through 2038. For U.S. federal tax purpose, approximately $89.0 million of Federal net operating losses have an indefinite carryforward period. Included in the U.S. net operating loss are $3.7 million of acquired losses from Power Quality Systems, Inc. and $0.3 million of acquired losses from Infinia Technology Corporation. Research and development and other tax credit carryforwards amounting to approximately $9.5 million and $3.3 million are available to offset federal and state income taxes, respectively, and will expire in the years ending March 31, 2019 through 2038.
At March 31, 2018, the Company had aggregate net operating loss carryforwards for its Austrian subsidiary, AMSC Austria GmbH, of approximately $46.5 million which can be carried forward indefinitely subject to certain annual limitations. At March 31, 2018, the Company had aggregate net operating loss carryforwards for its Chinese operation of approximately $11.7 million, which can be carried forward for five years and begin to expire December 31, 2018. Also the Company had immaterial amounts of current and net operating loss carryforwards for its other foreign operations which can be carried forward indefinitely.
Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “IRC”), provides limits on the extent to which a corporation that has undergone an ownership change (as defined) can utilize any net operating loss ("NOL") and general business tax credit carryforwards it may have. The Company updated its study through June 15, 2017 as a result of the May 2017 equity offering to determine whether Section 382 could limit the use of its carryforwards in this manner. After completing this study, the Company has concluded that the limitation will not have a material impact on its ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards.  If there were material ownership changes subsequent to the study, such changes could limit the Company's ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards. The Company increased its NOL’s by $0.3 million due to acquired losses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 from ITC. The Company conducted a study on the acquired NOL and concluded that the limitations under Section 382 will not have a material impact on its ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards
The total amount of undistributed foreign earnings available to be repatriated at March 31, 2018 was $2.6 million resulting in the recording of a $0.1 million deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes.
Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.  The Company did not identify any uncertain tax positions at March 31, 2018.  The Company did not have any gross unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2018 or 2017.
There were no reversals of uncertain tax positions in the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 

The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for federal and state income taxes. Any unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would favorably affect its effective tax rate in any future period. The Company does not expect that the amounts of unrecognized benefits will change significantly within the next twelve months. 
The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Major tax jurisdictions include the U.S., China, Romania and Austria. All 
76

U.S. income tax filings for fiscal years ended March 31, 1996 through 2018 remain open and subject to examination. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, the Company concluded a tax audit for the period April 1, 2008 through March 31, 2011 with its foreign subsidiary in Austria.  The results of this audit found no material exceptions to the Company’s tax positions. 
All fiscal years from the year ended March 31, 2013 through 2018 remain open and subject to examination in Austria.  The Company’s tax filings in China for calendar years 2013 and 2014 were examined with no material exceptions.  Although the 2013 and 2014 tax years in China were audited, they remain subject to further review until the statute of limitations has expired. The statute of limitations in China for the tax authorities to audit is generally three years. Tax filings in China for calendar years 2008 through 2012 and 2015 through 2018 remain open and subject to examination.  Tax filings in Romania for the years ended March 31, 2014 through 2018 remain open and subject to examination.

14. Stockholders’ Equity

Stock-Based Compensation Plans
As of March 31, 2018, the Company had two active stock plans: the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”) and the Amended and Restated 2007 Director Stock Plan (the “2007 Director Plan”). Both the 2007 Plan and the 2007 Director Plan were approved by the Company’s stockholders on July 29, 2016.
The 2007 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. In the case of options, the exercise price shall be equal to at least the fair market value of the common stock, as determined by (or in a manner approved by) the Board of Directors, on the date of grant. The contractual life of options is generally 10 years. Options generally vest over a 3-5 year period while restricted stock generally vests over a 3 year period.

As of March 31, 2018, the 2007 Director Plan provided for the grant of nonstatutory stock options and stock awards to members of the Board of Directors who are not also employees of the Company (outside directors). Under the terms of the 2007 Director Plan, each outside director is granted an option to purchase shares of common stock with an aggregate grant date value equal to $40,000 upon his or her initial election to the Board with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. These options vest in equal annual installments over a two-year period. In addition, each outside director is granted an award of shares of common stock with an aggregate grant date value equal to $40,000 3 business days following the last day of each fiscal year, subject to proration for any partial fiscal year of service.
As of March 31, 2018, the 2007 Plan had 666,092 shares and the 2007 Director Plan had 113,662 shares available for future issuance.
Stock-Based Compensation

The estimated fair value of the Company’s stock-based awards, less expected annual forfeitures, is amortized over the awards’ service period. The total unrecognized compensation cost for unvested outstanding stock options was $0.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This expense will be recognized over a weighted-average expense period of approximately 1.0 year. The total unrecognized compensation cost for unvested outstanding restricted stock was $2.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This expense will be recognized over a weighted-average expense period of approximately 1.9 years.
The following table summarizes employee stock-based compensation expense by financial statement line item for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

There were no stock options granted during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.  There were 9,703 stock options granted during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 at a weighted average grant date fair value of $4.06 per share. There were no stock options granted during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Intrinsic value represents the amount by which the market price of the common stock exceeds the exercise price of the options. Given the decline in the Company’s stock price, exercisable options as of March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 had no intrinsic value.
The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes valuation model for stock options granted during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows:


 | Fiscal years ended March 31,
 | 2018 | 2017 | | 2016
Expected volatility | N/A | 67.6 | % | | N/A
Risk-free interest rate | N/A | 1.3 | % | | N/A
Expected life (years) | N/A | 5.7 | | | N/A
Dividend yield | N/A | — | % | | N/A

The expected volatility rate was estimated based on an equal weighting of the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and the implied volatility of the Company’s traded options. The expected term was estimated based on an analysis of the Company’s historical experience of exercise, cancellation, and expiration patterns. The risk-free interest rate is based on the average of the five and seven year U.S. Treasury rates.

During the year ended March 31, 2017, the Company received net proceeds of $2.5 million, from sales of approximately 379,693 shares of its common stock at an average sales price of approximately $6.79 per share under the ATM. No sales of the Company's common stock were made under the ATM after March 31, 2017. On May 4, 2017, the Company provided to FBR the sales agent, a notice of termination of the ATM.

15. Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Commitments
79

The Company periodically enters into non-cancelable purchase contracts in order to ensure the availability of materials to support production of its products. Purchase commitments represent enforceable and legally binding agreements with suppliers to purchase goods or services. The Company periodically assesses the need to provide for impairment on these purchase contracts and record a loss on purchase commitments when required.
Lease Commitments
Operating leases include minimum payments under leases for the Company’s facilities and certain equipment. The Company’s primary leased facilities are located in Klagenfurt, Austria; Suzhou and Beijing, China; Ayer, Massachusetts; Timisoara, Romania; and Pewaukee, Wisconsin; with a combined total of approximately 187,000 square feet of space. These leases have varying expiration dates through November 2022 which can generally be terminated at the Company’s request after a six month advance notice. The Company leases other locations which focus primarily on applications engineering, sales and/or field service and do not have significant leases or physical presence.  See Item 2, “Properties” for further information.
Minimum future lease commitments at March 31, 2018 were as follows (in thousands):

Legal Contingencies
From time to time, the Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. The Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in a liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company estimates and discloses the possible loss or range of loss to the extent necessary to make the consolidated financial statements not misleading. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in its consolidated financial statements.
On September 13, 2011, the Company commenced a series of legal actions in China against Sinovel Wind Group Co., Ltd. (“Sinovel”). The Company’s Chinese subsidiary, Suzhou AMSC Superconductor Co. Ltd., filed a claim for arbitration with the Beijing Arbitration Commission in accordance with the terms of the Company’s supply contracts with Sinovel. The case is captioned (2011) Jing Zhong An Zi No. 0963. The Company alleges that Sinovel committed various material breaches of its contracts with the Company and that Sinovel has refused to pay past due amounts for prior shipments of core electrical components and spare parts. The Company is seeking compensation for past product shipments and retention (including interest) in the amount of approximately RMB 485 million (approximately $77 million) due to Sinovel’s breaches of its contracts. The Company is also seeking specific performance of its existing contracts as well as reimbursement of all costs and reasonable expenses with respect to the arbitration. The value of the undelivered components under the existing contracts, including the deliveries refused by Sinovel in March 2011, amounts to approximately RMB 4.6 billion (approximately $732 million).
On October 8, 2011, Sinovel filed with the Beijing Arbitration Commission an application under the caption (2011) Jing Zhong An Zi No. 0963, for a counterclaim against the Company for breach of the same contracts under which the Company filed its original arbitration claim. Sinovel claimed, among other things, that the goods supplied by the Company do not conform to the standards specified in the contracts and claimed damages in the amount of approximately RMB 1.2 billion (approximately $191 million). On February 27, 2012, Sinovel filed with the Beijing Arbitration Commission an application under the caption (2012) Jing Zhong An Zi No. 0157, against the Company for breach of the same contracts under which the Company filed its original arbitration claim. Sinovel claims, among other things, that the goods supplied by the Company do not conform to the standards specified in the contracts and claimed damages in the amount of approximately RMB 105 million (approximately $17 million). The Company believes that Sinovel’s claims are without merit and it intends to defend these actions vigorously. Since the proceedings in this 
80

matter are still in the early technical review phase, the Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses or range of losses at this time.
Other
The Company enters into long-term construction contracts with customers that require the Company to obtain performance bonds. The Company is required to deposit an amount equivalent to some or all the face amount of the performance bonds into an escrow account until the termination of the bond. When the performance conditions are met, amounts deposited as collateral for the performance bonds are returned to the Company. In addition, the Company has various contractual arrangements in which minimum quantities of goods or services have been committed to be purchased on an annual basis.
As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $0.2 million of restricted cash included in long-term assets. These amounts included in restricted cash primarily represent deposits to secure letters of credit for various supply contracts. These deposits are held in interest bearing accounts.
16. Employee Benefit Plans
The Company has implemented a defined contribution plan (the “Plan”) under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Any contributions made by the Company to the Plan are discretionary. The Company has a stock match program under which the Company matched, in the form of Company common stock, 50% of the first 6% of eligible contributions. The Company recorded expense of $0.4 million, for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, and recorded corresponding charges to additional paid-in capital related to this program.
17. Restructuring
The Company accounts for charges resulting from operational restructuring actions in accordance with ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (“ASC 420”) and ASC Topic 712, Compensation—Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits (“ASC 712”). In accounting for these obligations, the Company is required to make assumptions related to the amounts of employee severance, benefits, and related costs and the time period over which leased facilities will remain vacant, sublease terms, sublease rates and discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time the obligation arises. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate; changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the amount accrued on the consolidated balance sheet.
On April 3, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a plan to reduce the Company’s global workforce by approximately 8%, effective April 4, 2017. The purpose of the workforce reduction was to reduce operating expenses to better align with the Company’s current revenues. In fiscal 2017 the Company recorded restructuring charges of $1.5 million as a result of this reduction in force, which was comprised of $1.3 million of severance pay and $0.2 million of exit costs for the move of the corporate office. Included in the $1.3 million severance pay, charged to operations in the year ended March 31, 2018, is $0.5 million of severance pay for one of the Company's former executive officers pursuant to the terms of a severance agreement dated June 30, 2017. Under the terms of the severance agreement, the Company's former executive officer is entitled to 18 months of his base salary, which is expected to be paid by December 31, 2018. From and after January 1, 2018, the Company, at its discretion, may settle any remaining unpaid cash severance owed to its former executive officer through the issuance of a number of immediately vested shares of the Company’s common stock, determined by multiplying the remaining unpaid cash severance owed by 120%, and then dividing by the closing stock price per share of the Company's common stock as of the last business day prior to the issuance of the shares. As of March 31, 2018 the Company had not elected to settle any unpaid severance in common stock. 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 the Company incurred $0.2 million in facility costs related to the move to the newly leased Ayer, Massachusetts location.
All amounts related to these restructuring activities are expected to be paid by December 31, 2018.
The following table presents restructuring charges and cash payments during the year ended March 31, 2018 (in thousands):

18. Business Segments
The Company reports its financial results in two reportable business segments: Wind and Grid.
Through the Company’s Windtec Solutions, the Wind business segment enables manufacturers to field wind turbines with exceptional power output, reliability and affordability. The Company supplies advanced power electronics and control systems, licenses its highly engineered wind turbine designs, and provides extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. The Company’s design portfolio includes a broad range of drive trains and power ratings of 2 megawatts ("MWs") and higher. The Company provides a broad range of power electronics and software-based control systems that are highly integrated and designed for optimized performance, efficiency, and grid compatibility.
Through the Company’s Gridtec Solutions, the Grid business segment enables electric utilities and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and distribute power with exceptional efficiency, reliability and affordability. The sales process is enabled by transmission planning services that allow it to identify power grid congestion, poor power quality and other risks, which helps the Company determine how its solutions can improve network performance. These services often lead to sales of grid interconnection solutions for wind farms and solar power plants, power quality systems, and transmission and distribution cable systems.  The Company also sells ship protection products to the U.S. Navy through its Grid business segment.
The operating results for the two business segments are as follows (in thousands):

The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. The Company’s business segments have been determined in accordance with the Company’s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measures are segment revenues and segment operating loss. The disaggregated financial results of the segments reflect allocation of certain functional expense categories consistent with the basis and manner in which Company management internally disaggregates financial information for the purpose of assisting in making internal operating decisions. In addition, certain corporate 
82

expenses which the Company does not believe are specifically attributable or allocable to either of the two business segments have been excluded from the segment operating loss.
Unallocated corporate expenses primarily consist of stock-based compensation expense of $2.7 million, $2.9 million, and $3.2 million, in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, restructuring charges of $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, and impairment charges of $0.8 million, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, and a change in the fair value of contingent consideration of $0.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.

20. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") issued, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The guidance substantially converges final standards on revenue recognition between the FASB and IASB providing a framework on addressing revenue recognition issues and, upon its effective date, replaces almost all existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, in current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The FASB has subsequently issued the following amendments to ASU 2014-09 which are all effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
•In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations, which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.
•In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which clarifies certain aspects of identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance.
•In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow- Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients related to disclosures of remaining performance obligations, as well as other amendments to guidance on collectability, non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes collected from customers.
•In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends certain narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2014-09 including guidance related to the disclosure of remaining performance obligations and prior-period performance obligations, as well as other amendments to the guidance on loan guarantee fees, contract costs, refund liabilities, advertising costs and the clarification of certain examples.
As of March 31, 2018, the Company has completed its assessment of the effects of ASU 2014-09 and its amendments on its consolidated financial statements, and has implemented changes to its business processes, systems and controls to support revenue recognition and the related disclosures under this ASU. The Company’s assessment included a detailed review of representative contracts from each of the Company’s revenue streams and a comparison of its historical accounting policies and practices to the new standard. The Company adopted the new standards on April 1, 2018, and did so retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective transition method) ) to all existing contracts that have remaining obligations as of April 1, 2018. Accordingly, the Company has elected to retroactively adjust only those contracts that do not meet the definition of a complete contract at the date of the initial application. This guidance will lead to recognizing certain revenue transactions sooner than in the past on certain contracts, as the Company will need to estimate the revenue it will be entitled to upon contract completion, and later on other contracts such as Consulting and SOW transactions, due to lack of an enforceable right to payment for performance obligations satisfied over time. The 
84

Company's assessment supports the determination that there are no changes in the accounting for its largest revenue stream which includes Inox Wind Ltd as its primary customer. Across other revenue streams such as DVAR Equipment and DVAR Turnkey, the timing of revenue recognition will be affected for multiple types of contracts, primarily multiple performance obligation contracts in its Grid business unit, but those differences are not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The increase to adjust opening retained earnings will be less than $0.1 million for the period commencing on April 1, 2018, primarily related to the recognition of the deferred gain on the sale of the 64 Jackson Road building. Additionally, the adoption of this new standard is not expected to have any tax impact on the consolidated financial statements. As part of this analysis, the Company evaluated its information technology capabilities and systems, and did not incur significant information technology costs to modify systems currently in place.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The amendments in ASU 2016-01 will enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company does not expect any significant changes to the consolidated financial statement results with the adoption of ASU 2016-01.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in this ASU supersedes the leasing guidance in Topic 840, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the effects adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 will provide more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 may have on its consolidated financial statements.
In 2016, the FASB issued the following two ASU's on Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). Both amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year.
•In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 will provide more guidance towards the classification of multiple different types of cash flows in order to reduce the diversity in reporting across entities.
•In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The amendments in ASU 2016-18 will explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
The Company does not expect any significant changes to the consolidated financial statement results with the adoption of ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The amendments in ASU 2016-16 will improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year.  The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to the consolidated financial statement results with the adoption of ASU 2016-16.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations. The amendments in ASU 2017-01 will clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods.  The Company adopted ASU 2017-01 effective September 30, 2017, following the Acquisition of ITC. The Company considered these amendments in its decision to record the combination 
85

of the entities as an acquisition of a business. See Note 3, "Acquisition and Related Goodwill", for further details. These impacts have been included in the consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-03, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (Topic 250) and Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. The amendments in ASU 2017-03 provide additional detail surrounding disclosures required related to adoption of new pronouncements. The ASU is effective for the periods of each related pronouncement.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2017-03 may have on its consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 eliminated the prior requirement to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of an entity's assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Under the new guidelines an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. Following the Acquisition of ITC, the Company performed an analysis and determined that the transaction included a portion of goodwill. The Company has accounted for that value on its balance sheet as of March 31, 2018. See Note 3, "Acquisition and Related Goodwill" for further details. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 effective September 30, 2017. The Company performed its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and determined there was no impairment as of the annual impairment testing date and that there were no triggering events from the assessment date through March 31, 2018 requiring further impairment analysis at this time.
In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Non-financial Assets (Subtopic 610-20). The amendments in ASU 2017-05 clarify the scope of Subtopic 610-20, Other Income-Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Non-financial Assets, and to add guidance for partial sales of non-financial assets. Subtopic 610-20, which was issued in May 2014 as a part of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), provides guidance for recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of non-financial assets in contracts with non-customers.  The Company does not expect any significant changes to the consolidated financial statement results with the adoption of ASU 2017-05.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Subtopic 718) Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments in ASU 2017-09 provide clarity and reduce both (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.  The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. The Company does not expect any significant changes to the consolidated financial statement results with the adoption of ASU 2017-09.
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11, Earnings per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in ASU 2017-11 provide guidance for freestanding equity-linked financial instruments, such as warrants and conversion options in convertible debt or preferred stock, and should no longer be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2017-11 may have on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The amendments in ASU 2017-12 provide improved financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. In addition, the amendments in this update make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2017-12 may have on its consolidated financial statements.
