Item 1.  Business.
General
In certain instances where appropriate, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” refer to SI Financial Group, Inc. or Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company, or both.
SI Financial Group, Inc. is the parent holding company for Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company (the "Bank" or "Savings Institute"). The Bank operates as a community-oriented financial institution offering a full range of financial services to consumers and businesses in its market area, including life insurance and annuities.  The Bank attracts deposits from the general public and uses those funds to originate one- to four-family residential, multi-family and commercial real estate, commercial business (including time share lending, loans to condominium associations and medical loans) and consumer loans.  The Bank also purchases commercial business loans, including loans fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (the "SBA") and the United States Department of Agriculture (the "USDA"). The Bank sells certain fixed-rate one- to four-family residential conforming loans the Bank originates in the secondary market, primarily with the servicing retained.  Such sales generate mortgage banking fee income.  The remainder of the Bank’s loan portfolio is originated for investment.
The Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and management of the Company and the Bank are substantially similar.  The Company neither owns nor leases any property, but instead uses the premises, equipment and other property of the Bank with the payment of appropriate rental fees, as required by applicable law and regulations.  Thus, the financial information and discussion contained herein primarily relates to the activities of the Bank.

The Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge at www.SEC.gov and on the Company’s website, www.mysifi.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.  The information on the Company’s website shall not be considered as incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.
Market Area and Competition
The Company is headquartered in Willimantic, Connecticut, which is located in eastern Connecticut approximately 30 miles east of Hartford.  The Bank operates 23 full-service offices throughout Windham, New London, Tolland, Hartford and Middlesex counties in Connecticut and Newport and Washington counties in Rhode Island.  Most of the Bank’s deposit customers reside in the areas surrounding the Bank’s branch offices.  The Bank’s primary lending area is eastern Connecticut and Rhode Island with additional concentrations in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The economy in the Company’s Connecticut market area is relatively diverse and primarily oriented to the educational, service, entertainment, insurance, manufacturing and retail industries.  The major employers in our Connecticut market area include several hospitals, institutions of higher education, the Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods casinos, Aetna Insurance Company, Inc. and General Dynamics Defense Systems.  In addition, there are also many small to mid-sized businesses that support the local economy. The economy in the Company's Rhode Island market area is primarily oriented to the health care, educational, retail and hospitality industries. The major employers in the Rhode Island area include several hospitals, universities and pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Windham, New London, Tolland, Hartford and Middlesex counties in Connecticut have a total population of 1.6 million and 624,201 total households, according to SNL Financial. For 2018, median household income levels ranged from $67,000 to $87,000 in the five counties we maintain branch offices in Connecticut, compared to $79,000 for Connecticut and $63,000 for the United States, according to published statistics. Newport and Washington counties in Rhode Island have a total population and total households of 209,692 and 85,202, 
4


respectively, according to SNL Financial. Median household income levels in Newport and Washington counties for 2018 ranged from $77,000 to $81,000, compared to $64,000 for Rhode Island, according to published statistics.
The Bank faces significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans.  The most direct competition for deposits has historically come from several financial institutions operating in the Bank’s market area and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service companies, such as brokerage firms, credit unions and insurance companies.  The Bank also faces competition for investors’ funds from money market funds and other corporate and government securities.  At June 30, 2018, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), the Bank held 24.01% of the deposits in Windham County, Connecticut, which is the largest market share out of the 10 financial institutions with offices in this county.  Also, at June 30, 2018, the Bank held 1.09% of the deposits in New London, Tolland, Hartford and Middlesex counties, Connecticut, which is the 14th largest market share out of the 35 financial institutions with offices in these counties.  At June 30, 2018, the Bank held 4.85% of the deposits in Newport and Washington counties in Rhode Island, which is the 5th largest market share out of the 11 financial institutions with offices in these counties.  Several large national or regional bank holding companies also operate in the Bank’s Connecticut and Rhode Island market areas.  These institutions are significantly larger and, therefore, have significantly greater resources and may offer products and services that the Bank does not provide. 
The Bank’s competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in its market area, and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial service companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies.
The Bank expects competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Changes in federal law permit affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit the Company’s growth in the future.
Risk Management
Overview. Managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution. Our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as available for sale securities, that are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. Other risks the Company faces are operational risks, liquidity risks and reputation risk. Operational risks include risks related to fraud, regulatory compliance, processing errors, cyber security, technology and disaster recovery. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors, lenders or borrowers or for the Company to pay its obligations as they become due as a result of unforeseen circumstances. Reputation risk is the risk negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could cause a decline in the Company’s customer base or revenue.
Credit Risk Management. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans. The Company has strengthened its oversight of problem assets by maintaining a Managed Assets Committee. The Committee, which consists of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other loan and credit administration officers, meets quarterly to review classified and watch list credits to ensure the appropriateness of the current classification and to attempt to identify any new problem loans. The Board of Directors reviews the Committee’s reports on a quarterly basis.
Lending Activities
General. The Bank’s loan portfolio consists primarily of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, multi-family and commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans. To a much lesser extent, the loan portfolio includes construction and consumer loans.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank had loans held for sale totaling $1.9 million.

One- to Four-Family Residential Loans.  One of the Bank’s primary lending activities is the origination of mortgage loans to enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes or to construct new residential dwellings in its market area.  The Bank offers fixed-rate loans with terms of 10, 15, 20 or 30 years.  The Bank’s adjustable-rate mortgage loans are based primarily on 30-year amortization schedules.  Interest rates and payments on adjustable-rate mortgage loans adjust annually after a one, three, five, seven or ten-year initial fixed period.  Borrower demand for adjustable-rate loans versus fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of current and anticipated future interest rates, the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans and the initial period interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment and the effect each has on the Bank’s interest rate risk.  The loan fees charged, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined on the basis of the Bank’s pricing criteria and competitive market conditions.

Generally, the Bank does not originate conventional mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 95% and generally originates loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80% only when secured by first liens on owner-occupied one- to four-family residences.  Mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% generally 
6


require private mortgage insurance or additional collateral.  The Bank requires all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a board approved independent licensed appraiser and requires title insurance on all first mortgage loans.  Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance and flood insurance for loans on properties located in a flood zone before closing the loan.
In an effort to provide financing for moderate income and first-time buyers, the Bank offers loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration and participates in the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority Program.  The Bank also offers Guaranteed Rural Housing Loans through the USDA. The Bank offers fixed-rate residential mortgage loans through these programs to qualified individuals and originates the loans using modified underwriting guidelines.
Multi-Family and Commercial Real Estate Loans.  The origination of multi-family and commercial real estate ("CRE") loans is another primary lending activity of the Bank. Such loans are made throughout its market area and in strategic areas in the surrounding region for the purpose of acquiring, developing, improving or refinancing multi-family and commercial real estate where the property is the primary collateral securing the loan, and the income generated from the property is the primary repayment source.  The Bank offers fixed-rate and adjustable-rate multi-family and commercial real estate loans.  Adjustable-rate multi-family and commercial real estate loans originate for amortization periods up to 25 years.  The Bank may originate loans with 30-year amortization periods in investment commercial real estate and commercial bond finance loan categories only. Interest rates and payments on these loans typically adjust every five years after a five-year initial fixed-rate period. The Bank’s multi-family and commercial real estate loans are generally secured by owner-occupied properties, including churches and retail facilities. These loans are secured by first mortgages that generally do not exceed 75% of the property’s appraised value.  
The Bank intends to continue to emphasize making these types of loans, as market conditions permit, as such loans produce yields that are generally higher than one- to four-family residential loans and are more sensitive to changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2018, the largest outstanding multi-family or commercial real estate loan was $17.0 million.  This loan is secured by a single tenant retail property and was performing according to its terms at December 31, 2018.
The Bank maintains an Out-of-Market CRE Market Lending Program. The primary focus of this program is to develop greater investment in commercial real estate loans in the metro-Boston area and the surrounding region. The Bank employs a highly seasoned senior commercial real estate loan officer with significant expertise in lending in this region. Loans originated in this lending area comprise income producing properties representing office, flex, industrial, retail, single credit tenant and residential apartments. These properties have strong income support, favorable demographics and are owned and managed by experienced and financially strong property managers. These loans are predominately shorter-term loan facilities (generally 5-year maturities), which are structured to provide the Bank with strong asset growth, coupled with a focus on credit quality and interest rate risk management. At December 31, 2018, the Bank's exposure in out-of-market CRE market lending was $286.9 million.
Construction and Land Loans.  The Bank originates loans to individuals, and to a lesser extent, builders, to finance construction of residential dwellings.  The Bank also originates construction loans for commercial development projects, including condominiums, apartment buildings, single-family subdivisions as well as owner-occupied properties used for businesses.  Residential construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually twelve months.  At the end of the construction phase, the loan generally converts to a permanent mortgage loan.  Commercial construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which may range from three to twenty-four months. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% on residential construction, 75% on construction for nonresidential properties and 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or cost of the project on multi-family construction.  At December 31, 2018, the largest outstanding commercial construction loan commitment was $13.4 million for the construction of a hotel, of which $3.8 million was outstanding, and the 
7


largest residential construction loan commitment was $688,000, none of which was outstanding.  These loans were performing according to their terms at December 31, 2018.  Primarily all commitments to fund construction loans require an appraisal of the property by a board approved independent licensed appraiser.  Also, inspections of the property are required before the disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan.
The Bank also originates development land loans to individuals, local contractors and developers to make improvements on approved building lots, subdivisions and condominium projects within two years of the date of the loan.  Such loans to individuals generally are written with a maximum loan-to-value ratio based upon the appraised value or purchase price of the land.  Maximum loan-to-value ratio on raw land is 50%, while the maximum loan-to-value ratio for land development loans involving approved projects is 65%.  The Bank offers fixed-rate land loans and variable-rate land loans that adjust monthly.  Land loans totaled $1.4 million at December 31, 2018.
Commercial Business Loans. The Bank originates commercial business loans to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships and small businesses primarily in its market area.  When originating commercial business loans, the Bank considers the financial statements of the borrower, the borrower’s payment history of both corporate and personal debt, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business, the viability of the industry in which the customer operates and the value of the collateral. At December 31, 2018, the largest outstanding commercial loan was $14.9 million, which is a general obligation bond to a private college and is further secured by a pledge of the unrestricted receipts, revenues, income and other monies of the college.  This loan was performing according to its terms at December 31, 2018.
These loans are generally secured by business assets other than real estate, such as business equipment and inventory, in conformance to policy established borrowing base limits. The Bank originates one-year revolving credit facilities to finance short-term working capital needs of businesses to be repaid by business cash flow. In addition, the Bank originates non-revolving credit facilities to provide a period of time during which the business can borrow funds for planned equipment purchases and other improvement expenditures.  These loans convert to a term loan at the expiration of a draw period, which is not to exceed twelve months, and will be paid over a predefined amortization period.  Additional products such as time notes, letters of credit and equipment lease financing are offered. Additionally, the Bank may purchase the portion of commercial business loans that are fully guaranteed by the SBA or the USDA.  At December 31, 2018, purchased SBA and USDA loans totaled $68.5 million.
The Bank utilizes experienced loan officers and staff to offer specialized lending programs to finance capital improvements for residential and commercial condominium associations as well as the time share industry. Condominium association loans are secured with the assigned right to levy and collect special assessments from the individual unit owners. The condominium association loan portfolio consists of 75 loans totaling $35.9 million as of December 31, 2018. The Bank is not involved with the development of time share resorts, but provides financing for investors with loans secured by diverse consumer receivables. The Bank's exposure in time share lending was 16 loans totaling $39.4 million at December 31, 2018.
Consumer Loans.  The Bank offers a variety of consumer loans, primarily home equity lines of credit, and, to a lesser extent, loans secured by marketable securities, passbook or certificate accounts, motorcycles, automobiles and recreational vehicles.  Generally, the Bank offers automobile loans with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 100% of the purchase price for new vehicles.  
The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and their ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loans. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount.  Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest that are indexed to the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal.  A home equity line of credit may be drawn down by the borrower for a period of nine years and ten months from the date of the loan agreement. During this period, the borrower is only required to make interest-only payments.  The borrower has to pay back 
8


the amount outstanding under the line of credit over a term not to exceed fifteen years, beginning at the end of the nine-year and ten month period.  The Bank will offer home equity loans with a maximum combined loan-to-value ratio of 80%.
Loan Underwriting Risks.  While the Bank anticipates that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate mortgages, the increased mortgage payments required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults.  The marketability and collateral value of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment.  In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans help make the Bank’s loan portfolio more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits.
Loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.  Additionally, many of our multi-family and commercial real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan. Of primary concern in multi-family and commercial real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income-producing properties often depend on the successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject, to a greater extent than residential real estate loans, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income-producing properties, the Bank generally requires borrowers and loan guarantors to provide annual financial statements and/or tax returns.  In reaching a decision on whether to make a multi-family or commercial real estate loan, consideration is given to the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and the profitability and value of the underlying property.  The Bank generally requires that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.20.  Environmental screens, surveys and inspections are obtained when circumstances suggest the possibility of the presence of hazardous materials. Further, in connection with the ongoing monitoring of the loan, the Bank typically reviews the property, the underlying loan and guarantors annually.
Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate.  Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction, the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and the ability of the project to be sold upon completion.  During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns.  If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the building.  If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a building having a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment.  If the Bank is forced to foreclose on a building before or at completion due to a borrower default, the Bank may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs.
Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of the borrower’s underlying business.  As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself.  Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value.
Consumer loans entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly.  In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted 
9


consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant significant collection efforts against the borrower.  In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.  Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.
Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales and Servicing.  Loan originations come from a number of sources.  The primary source of loan originations are the Bank’s in-house loan originators, and, to a lesser extent, advertising and referrals from customers.
The Bank may purchase portions of loans that are fully guaranteed by the SBA or the USDA.  The loans are primarily for commercial and agricultural properties located throughout the United States.  The Bank did not purchase such loans during the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017. There were no sales of SBA and USDA loans for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
The Bank purchased $56.0 million and $36.1 million of multi-family and commercial real estate loans and other commercial business loans in 2018 and 2017, respectively, which included primarily participation loans and medical loans. The Bank performs its own underwriting analysis before purchasing a loan and, therefore, believes there should not be a greater risk of default on these obligations compared to loans the Bank originates itself.  However, in a purchased loan, the Bank does not service the loan and thus is subject to the policies and practices of the originating lender with regard to monitoring delinquencies, pursuing collections and instituting foreclosure proceedings. Participation loans are entered into by the Bank with other institutions. Total participation loans entered into by the Bank were $35.0 million for 2018 and $25.0 million for 2017. Medical loans are purchased from a company specializing in medical loan originations. Medical loans are commercial business loans secured by medical equipment and are primarily out of our market area. Total medical loans purchased were $19.4 million and $10.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Bank originates conventional conforming one- to four-family loans which meet Fannie Mae underwriting standards.  The Bank sells certain fixed-rate one- to four-family residential conforming loans in the secondary market, primarily on a servicing retained basis.  Such loans are sold to Fannie Mae, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the "FHLB") under the Mortgage Partnership Finance Program and other third-party correspondents.  The decision to sell loans in the secondary market is based on prevailing market interest rate conditions, an analysis of the composition and risk of the loan portfolio, liquidity needs and interest rate risk management.  Generally, loans are sold without recourse.  The Bank utilizes the proceeds from these sales primarily to meet liquidity needs. Proceeds from the sale of one- to four-family loans totaled $61.1 million and $54.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Bank intends to continue to originate these types of loans for sale in the secondary market to increase its noninterest income.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank retained the servicing rights on $270.7 million of loans, consisting primarily of fixed-rate mortgage loans sold with or without recourse to third parties.  Loan repurchase commitments are agreements to repurchase loans previously sold upon the occurrence of conditions established in the contract, including default by the underlying borrower.  At December 31, 2018, there was no exposure amount for loans sold with recourse.  Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent mortgagors, processing insurance and tax payments on behalf of borrowers, assisting in foreclosures and property dispositions when necessary and general administration of loans.
The following table sets forth the Bank’s loan originations, loan purchases, loan sales, principal repayments, net loan charge-offs and other reductions on loans for the years indicated.

Loan Maturity.  The following table shows the contractual maturity of the Bank’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2018.  The table does not reflect any estimate of prepayments, which significantly shortens the average life of all loans and may cause actual repayment experience to differ from that shown below.  Demand loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less.  The amounts shown below exclude deferred loan fees and costs.

While one- to four-family residential real estate loans are normally originated with terms of up to 30 years, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full upon the sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan.  Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase, sale and refinancing activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority.  The Bank’s lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Company’s Board of Directors and management. All residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit in excess of $10.0 million or other consumer loans in excess of $4.0 million require the approval of the Board of Directors. The Loan Committee of the Board of Directors has the authority to approve: (1) residential mortgage loans and consumer home equity lines of credit up to $10.0 million, (2) commercial loans up to the regulatory legal lending limit, and (3) consumer loans up to $4.0 million. The Credit Committee, which consists of members of management, has authority to approve: (1) residential mortgage loans and consumer home equity lines of credit up to $4.0 million, (2) commercial loans up to $8.0 million, and (3) consumer loans up to $2.0 million. The President and Chief Lending Officer have approval authority for: (1) residential mortgage loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards up to $4.0 million or $417,000 for those that are nonconforming, (2) home equity lines of credit up to $4.0 million, and (3) consumer loans up to $250,000 individually or $1.0 million jointly. The President and Chief Lending Officer have approval authority for commercial real estate and other commercial loans up to $1.0 million individually or $2.0 million jointly.  Additionally, certain loan and branch administration personnel have the authority to approve residential mortgage loans, home equity lines and consumer loans up to certain limits as specified in the Bank's loan policy.
Loans to One Borrower.  The maximum amount that the Bank may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is limited, by regulation, to 15% of the Bank’s stated capital and reserves.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s general regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was approximately $25.4 million.  At that date, the Bank’s largest lending relationship was $20.5 million, representing commercial real estate loans on office buildings.  These loans were performing according to their original terms at December 31, 2018.
Loan Commitments.  The Bank issues commitments for fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events.  Commitments to originate mortgage loans are legally binding agreements 
13


to lend to customers.  Generally, our mortgage loan commitments expire in 60 days or less from the date of the application.
Delinquencies.  When a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, the Bank takes a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status.  The Bank makes initial contact with the borrower when the loan becomes 15 days past due.  If payment is not then received by the 30th day of delinquency, additional letters and phone calls generally are made. When the loan becomes 90 days past due, a letter is sent notifying the borrower foreclosure proceedings will commence if the loan is not brought current within 30 days.  Generally, when the loan becomes 120 days past due, the Bank will commence foreclosure proceedings against any real property that secures the loan or attempt to repossess any personal property that secures a consumer or commercial loan.  If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan is typically sold at foreclosure.  The Bank may consider loan repayment arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances.
Management reports monthly to the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board regarding the amount of loans delinquent 30 days or more, all loans in foreclosure and all foreclosed and repossessed property that the Bank owns.
The following table provides information about delinquencies in the Bank’s loan portfolio at the dates indicated.

Classified Assets.  Management of the Bank, including the Managed Asset Committee, consisting of a number of the Bank’s officers, review and classify the assets of the Bank on a monthly basis and the Board of Directors reviews the results of the reports on a quarterly basis.  Federal regulations and the Bank’s internal policies require that management utilize an internal asset classification system to monitor and evaluate the credit risk inherent in 
14


its loan portfolio.  In addition, the Bank's regulators have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified.  There are three classifications for problem assets; substandard, doubtful and loss. “Substandard assets” must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  “Doubtful assets” have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as “substandard” with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high probability of loss.  Assets classified as “loss” are those assets considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as assets of the institution are not warranted.  The regulations also provide for a “special mention” category, described as assets which do not currently expose the Bank to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weakness deserving close attention.  If the Bank classifies an asset as a loss, a loan loss allowance in the amount of 100% of the portion of the asset classified as a loss is established or the loan is fully charged-off.
The following table shows the aggregate amounts of the Bank’s criticized and classified assets as of December 31, 2018.

At December 31, 2018, total criticized and classified assets were comprised of 47 commercial real estate loans totaling $37.3 million, three construction loans totaling $9.7 million, 51 residential mortgage loans totaling $8.5 million, 13 commercial business loans totaling $4.2 million, seven home equity loans totaling $458,000 and two other consumer loans totaling $2,000. Of the $32.3 million in substandard loans, $9.0 million were nonperforming at December 31, 2018. Substandard loans included residential real estate loans totaling $2.3 million, multi-family and commercial real estate loans totaling $991,000 and other commercial business loans totaling $68,000 that were 90 days or more past due. Doubtful loans included one commercial business loan totaling $257,000 that was 90 days or more past due.  
Other than disclosed in the above tables, there were no loans at December 31, 2018 that management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms.
Nonperforming Assets and Restructured Loans.  The Bank considers repossessed assets and loans that are 90 days or more past due to be nonperforming assets.  Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days delinquent at which time the accrual of interest ceases and any previously recorded interest is reversed 
15


and recorded as a reduction of loan interest and fee income.  Typically, payments received on a nonaccrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal and interest balance as determined at the time of collection of the loan.
The Bank periodically may agree to modify the contractual terms of loans.  When a loan is modified and concessions have been made to the original contractual terms, such as reductions of interest rates or deferral of interest or principal payments, due to the borrower’s financial condition, the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”).  All TDRs are initially classified as impaired. The Bank adheres to its nonaccrual policy for all TDR loans. Loans that were current prior to modification would not require nonaccrual status subsequent to the modification. If the accrual of interest was suspended on the loan prior to the modification or if the payment amount significantly increased subsequent to the modification, the loan would remain on nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates the willingness and the ability to make the restructured loan payments for a period of six consecutive months.
Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as a foreclosed asset until it is sold.  When property is acquired, it is recorded at fair value, net of estimated selling expenses.  Holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges to earnings.
The following table provides information with respect to the Bank’s nonperforming assets and TDRs as of the dates indicated.

The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to increases of $1.6 million in nonperforming multi-family and commercial real estate loans and $1.3 million in residential real estate loans.  Nonaccrual loans consisted of 26 residential one- to four-family loans, six commercial real estate loans, three home equity loans, two commercial business loans and three consumer loans.
Other real estate owned decreased $506,000 from December 31, 2017 to $720,000 at December 31, 2018.  During 2018, the Bank acquired two residential properties with a net carrying value of $222,000 and sold four residential properties with a net carrying value of $515,000 and one commercial property with a net carrying value of $131,000.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, TDRs totaled $12.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively, as a result of interest rate concessions, deferral of principal payments, extension of maturity or a combination of these items.  Of the TDRs at December 31, 2018, $9.7 million continued to accrue interest under the restructured terms of their agreements while the accrual of interest was suspended on loans totaling $2.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, there were no TDRs that were in payment default. All TDRs were performing in accordance with the terms of their restructured loan agreements.
Interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 had nonaccruing loans and TDRs been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period amounted to $445,000. The amount of interest recognized on impaired loans was $692,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Loans Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality.  Loans acquired in a transfer, including business combinations, where there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, are accounted for under accounting guidance for purchased credit-impaired loans. This guidance provides that the excess of the cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date (i.e., the accretable yield) is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the loans, provided the timing and amount of future cash flows is reasonably estimable. Such loans are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield and not to contractual interest payments. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. Subsequent to acquisition, probable decreases in expected cash flows are recognized through a provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. If the Company has probable and significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected, the Company will first reverse any previously established allowance for loan losses and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment.
Allowance for Loan Losses.  The allowance for loan losses, a material estimate which could change significantly in the near-term, is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings to account for losses inherent in the loan portfolio and estimated to occur, and is maintained at a level management considers adequate to absorb losses in the loan portfolio.  Loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the uncollectibility of the principal loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses when received.  In the determination of the allowance for loan losses, management obtains independent appraisals for significant properties, when necessary.
Management's judgment in determining the adequacy of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.  The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a monthly basis by management and is based on the evaluation of the known and inherent risk characteristics and size and composition of the loan portfolio, the assessment of current economic and real estate market conditions, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, historical loan loss experience, level and trends of nonperforming loans, delinquencies, classified assets and loan charge-offs and evaluations of loans and other relevant factors.
17


The allowance for loan losses consists of the following key elements:

◦ | Specific allowance for identified impaired loans. For loans identified as impaired, an allowance is established when the present value of expected cash flows (or observable market price of the loan or fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. 


◦ | General valuation allowance. The general component represents a valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio, after excluding impaired loans. For this portion of the allowance, loans are segregated by category and assigned an allowance percentage based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors stratified by the following loan segments: residential one- to four-family, multi-family and commercial real estate, construction, commercial business and consumer. Management uses a rolling average of historical losses based on the time frame appropriate to capture relevant loss data for each loan segment. This historical loss factor is adjusted for the following qualitative factors: changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collections, charge-off and recovery practices; changes in national, regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectibility of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments; changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and in the terms of the loans; changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending and underwriting management and other relevant staff; changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans; changes in the quality of the loan review system; changes in the underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans; the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the portfolio. 

In computing the allowance for loan losses, we do not assign a general valuation allowance to the SBA and USDA loans we purchase as such loans are fully guaranteed.  Such loans accounted for $68.5 million, or 5.2% of the loan portfolio, at December 31, 2018.
The majority of the Company's loans are collateralized by real estate located in eastern Connecticut, Rhode Island and the Boston metro area. Certain commercial real estate loans are secured by collateral located outside of our primary market area. Accordingly, the collateral value of a substantial portion of the Company's loan portfolio and real estate acquired through foreclosure is susceptible to changes in local market conditions.
Although management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations.  Furthermore, while management believes it has established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America, our regulators, in reviewing the loan portfolio, may require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from those of the Company.  In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate or increases may be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above.  Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding during the year | 0.06 | | | 0.01 | | | 0.02 | | | 0.04 | | 0.06 | 

The allowance as a percentage of total loans increased to 1.11% at December 31, 2018 compared to 0.99% at December 31, 2017.  The higher provision for loan losses for 2018 was primarily due to increases in nonperforming loans, charge-offs, reserves for impaired loans and an increase in commercial loans, which carry a higher degree of risk than other loans held in the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, nonperforming loans totaled $9.8 million compared to $6.4 million at December 31, 2017. An increase of $1.6 million in nonperforming multi-family and commercial real estate loans and an increase of $1.3 million in nonperforming residential real estate loans , contributed to the higher balance of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2018. Specific loan loss allowances relating to impaired loans increased to $1.9 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $482,000 at December 31, 2017.

Investment Activities
The Company has legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, government-sponsored enterprises, state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit of federally-insured institutions. Within certain regulatory limits, the Company also may invest a portion of its assets in corporate securities and mutual funds.  The Company is also required to maintain an investment in FHLB stock and Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") stock. While the Company has the authority under applicable law and its investment policies to invest in derivative securities, the Company had no such investments at December 31, 2018.
The Company’s primary source of income continues to be derived from its loan portfolio.  The investment portfolio is mainly used to meet the cash flow needs of the Company, provide adequate liquidity for the protection of customer deposits and yield a favorable return on excess funds.  The type of securities and the maturity periods are dependent on the composition of the loan portfolio, interest rate risk, liquidity position and tax strategies of the Company.  The Company’s investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to maintain a balance of high quality, diversified investments to minimize risk, to provide collateral for pledging requirements, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, to provide an alternate source of low-risk investments when demand for loans is weak, to generate a favorable return and to assist in the financing needs of various local public entities, subject to credit quality review and liquidity concerns.
The Company’s Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of the Company’s Investment Policy and appointment of the Investment Committee.  The Investment Committee is responsible for the approval of investment strategies and monitoring investment performance.  The execution of specific investment initiatives and the day-to-day oversight of the Company’s investment portfolio is the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.  These officers, and others designated by the Board, are authorized to execute investment transactions up to specified limits based on the type of security without prior approval of the Investment Committee. Transactions exceeding these limitations require the approval of two of these officers designated by the Board, one of whom must be either the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer. Individual investment transactions are reviewed by the Board of Directors on a monthly basis, while portfolio composition and performance are reviewed at least quarterly by the Investment Committee. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date individual securities are acquired, and the appropriateness of such classification is reassessed at each balance sheet date.
Debt securities management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as “held to maturity” and recorded at amortized cost.  Securities purchased and held principally for trading in the near term are classified as “trading securities.” These securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings.  Securities not classified as held to maturity or trading, including equity securities with readily determinable fair values, are classified as “available for sale” and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes.
At December 31, 2018, the Company’s investment portfolio consisted solely of available for sale securities, totaling $143.8 million, representing 8.7% of assets.  The Company’s available for sale securities consisted primarily of “agency” mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae with stated final maturities of 30 years or less, U.S. government and agency obligations, government-sponsored enterprise securities with maturities of 20 years or less, and, to a lesser extent, tax-exempt securities, collateralized debt obligations and obligations of state and political subdivisions with maturities of 30 years or less.

(1) Agency securities refer to debt obligations issued or guaranteed by government corporations or government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”).  Non-agency securities, or private-label securities, are the sole obligation of their issuer and are not guaranteed by one of the GSEs or the U.S. Government.
The Company had no investment in a single entity that had an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of the Company's shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2018.
The following table sets forth the amortized cost, weighted average yields and contractual final maturities of available for sale securities at December 31, 2018.  Weighted average yields on tax-exempt securities are not presented on a tax equivalent basis because the impact would be insignificant.  Certain mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations have adjustable interest rates and will reprice periodically within the various maturity ranges.  These repricing schedules are not reflected in the following table below.  At December 31, 2018, the amortized cost of mortgage-backed securities with adjustable rates totaled $8.4 million.

Each reporting period, the Company evaluates securities with a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of the investment to determine whether the impairment is deemed to have other-than-temporary impairment 
22


("OTTI").  The evaluation is based upon factors such as the creditworthiness of the issuers/guarantors, the underlying collateral, if applicable, and the continuing performance of the securities.  Management also evaluates other facts and circumstances that may be indicative of an OTTI condition, such as the type of security, length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the near-term prospects of the issuers.  OTTI is required to be recognized if (1) the Company intends to sell the security; (2) it is “more likely than not” that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) for debt securities, the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis.
For impaired debt securities the Company intends to sell, or more likely than not will be required to sell, the full amount of the depreciation is recognized as OTTI through earnings.  For all other impaired debt securities, credit-related OTTI is recognized through earnings and noncredit-related OTTI is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes.  During 2018, the Company did not recognize any OTTI for credit losses on debt securities.  See Notes 3 and 15 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for more details.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds
General.  Deposits, other borrowings, repayments and sale of loans and investment securities are the major sources of the Company’s funds for lending and other investment purposes.  Loan and investment security repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions.
Deposit Accounts.  Substantially all of the Bank’s depositors are residents of Connecticut or Rhode Island.  The Bank attracts deposits in its market areas through advertising and through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including noninterest-bearing demand accounts (such as checking accounts) and interest-bearing accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts, regular savings accounts and certificates of deposit).  Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ("CDARS") and Insured Cash Sweeps ("ICS") deposits, which are generally offered to in-market retail and commercial customers, offer our customers the ability to receive FDIC insurance on deposits up to $50.0 million. At December 31, 2018, CDARS deposits totaled $1.6 million and ICS deposits totaled $957,000. The Bank also utilizes brokered deposits, which were $21.4 million at December 31, 2018. Brokered deposits, which are deposits sold by brokers to banks, are generally out-of-market, thus, they are less likely to remain with the institution after their maturity, which may require us to replace these deposits with higher cost alternative funds. Also, because they generally have larger balances, they often are accompanied by a higher interest rate.  Generally, the Bank does not utilize brokered deposits as a primary funding source, but rather maintains such deposits to ensure access to another liquidity source should the need arise.  Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rates, among other factors. In determining the terms of the Bank’s deposit accounts, the Bank considers the rates offered by its competition, liquidity needs, profitability, matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns.  The Bank generally reviews its deposit mix and pricing weekly. The Bank’s current strategy is to offer competitive rates, but not be the market leader in every account type and maturity.

Cash Management Services.  The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts designed for the businesses operating in its market area. The Bank's business banking deposit products include a commercial checking account and checking accounts specifically designed for small businesses and non-profit organizations. In an effort to increase its commercial deposits, the Bank also offers remote capture products and money market accounts for its business customers.

FHLB Borrowings.  The Bank utilizes advances from the FHLB to supplement its supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements.  As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had outstanding borrowings with the FHLB of $151.8 million.
The FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions.  As a member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB and is authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain mortgage loans and other assets (principally mortgage related securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth or on the FHLB’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness.
Junior Subordinated Debt Owed to Unconsolidated Trust.  In 2006, SI Capital Trust II (the “Trust”), a business trust, issued $8.0 million of trust preferred securities in a private placement and issued 248 shares of common stock at $1,000 par value to the Company. The Trust has no independent assets or operations and was formed to issue trust preferred securities and invest the proceeds in an equivalent amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company.  The trust preferred securities mature in 30 years and bear interest at a rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.70%.  The interest rate on these securities at December 31, 2018 was 4.49%.  After receipt of regulatory approval, the Company may redeem the trust preferred securities, in whole or in part.
The debentures are the sole assets of the Trust and are subordinate to all of the Company’s existing and future obligations for borrowed money, its obligations under letters of credit and certain derivative contracts and any guarantees by the Company of any such obligations.  The trust preferred securities generally rank equal to the trust common securities in priority of payment, but rank before the trust common securities if and so long as the Company fails to make principal or interest payments on the debentures.  Concurrently with the issuance of the debentures and the trust preferred and common securities, the Company issued a guarantee related to the trust securities for the benefit of the holders.  The Company’s obligations under the guarantee and the Company’s obligations under the debentures, the related indentures and the trust agreement relating to the trust securities, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the obligations of the Trust under the trust preferred securities.  If the Company defers interest payments on the junior subordinated debt, or otherwise is in default of the obligations, the Company would be prohibited from making dividend payments to its shareholders.

Trust Services
In May 2017, the Company sold its trust and asset management business, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $795,000. The Bank’s trust department provided fiduciary services, investment management and retirement services to individuals, partnerships, corporations and institutions.  Total trust services revenue was $431,000 and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Subsidiary Activities
The Company’s subsidiaries include Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company and SI Capital Trust II. The following are descriptions of the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiaries.
SI Realty Company, Inc.   SI Realty Company, Inc., established in 1999 as a Connecticut corporation, holds real estate managed by the Bank, including foreclosure properties.  At December 31, 2018, SI Realty Company, Inc. had $6.0 million in assets.
SI Mortgage Company.  In January 1999, the Bank formed SI Mortgage Company to manage and hold loans secured by real property.  SI Mortgage Company qualifies as a “passive investment company,” which exempts it from Connecticut income tax under current law.  Income tax savings to the Bank from the use of a passive investment company was $764,000 and $748,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Personnel
26


At December 31, 2018, the Company had 274 full-time employees and 21 part-time employees.  None of the Company’s employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit.  The Company believes its relationship with its employees is good.
REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
General. The Bank, a Connecticut-chartered stock savings bank, is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Connecticut Department of Banking (the “CDB”) and, as a member of the FRB. The Bank is a member of the FHLB and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund managed by the FDIC. The Bank must file reports with the CDB concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions and opening or closing branch offices. There are periodic examinations by the FRB and the CDB to evaluate the Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan losses. Any change in such policies, whether by the CDB, the FRB or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their operations. 
The Company, as a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company, is required to file certain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB. The Company is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. 
Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and the Company are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations.
State Regulation and Supervision
Connecticut Banking Commissioner.  The Connecticut Banking Commissioner regulates the deposit, lending and investment activities of state-chartered banks, including the Bank. The approval of the Connecticut Banking Commissioner is required for, among other things, the establishment of branch offices and business combination transactions. The Commissioner conducts periodic examinations of Connecticut-chartered banks, as does the FRB. The FRB also regulates many of the areas regulated by the Connecticut Banking Commissioner, and federal law may limit some of the authority provided to Connecticut-chartered banks by Connecticut law.
Lending Activities. Connecticut banking laws grant banks broad lending authority. With certain limited exceptions, unsecured loans of any one obligor under this statutory authority may not exceed 15.0% of a bank’s equity capital and allowance for loan losses. An additional 10.0% may be lent if fully secured.
Consumer Protection. The Bank is also subject to a variety of Connecticut statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations.
27


Dividends. The Bank may pay cash dividends out of its net profits. For purposes of this restriction, “net profits” represents the remainder of all earnings from current operations. Further, the total amount of all dividends declared by a bank in any year may not exceed the sum of a bank’s net profits for the year in question combined with its retained net profits from the preceding two years, without the specific approval of the Connecticut Banking Commissioner. FRB regulations establish limits on dividends, including requiring FRB approval for aggregate dividends exceeding net income for the current year and the two prior calendar years. In addition, as a subsidiary of a bank holding company, the Bank must provide prior notice to the FRB of any dividend. The FRB has the authority to object to the dividend if deemed unsafe or unsound. Federal law also prevents an institution from paying dividends or making other capital distributions that, if by doing so, would cause it to become “undercapitalized.” The FRB may limit a bank’s ability to pay dividends. No dividends may be paid to the Bank’s sole stockholder, the Company, if such dividends would reduce stockholders’ equity below the amount of the liquidation account required by federal regulations.
Powers.  Connecticut law permits Connecticut banks to sell insurance and fixed and variable rate annuities if licensed to do so by the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. With the prior approval of the Connecticut Banking Commissioner, Connecticut banks are also authorized to engage in a broad range of activities related to the business of banking, or that are financial in nature or that are permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act or the Home Owners’ Loan Act, both federal statutes, or the regulations promulgated as a result of these statutes. Connecticut banks are also authorized to engage in any activity permitted for a national bank or a federal savings association upon filing notice with the Connecticut Banking Commissioner unless the Connecticut Banking Commissioner disapproves the activity.
Assessments. Connecticut banks are required to pay annual assessments to the CDB to fund the CDB’s operations. The general assessments are paid pro-rata based upon a bank’s asset size.
Enforcement. Under Connecticut law, the Connecticut Banking Commissioner has extensive enforcement authority over Connecticut banks and, under certain circumstances, affiliated parties, insiders, and agents. The Connecticut Banking Commissioner’s enforcement authority includes cease and desist orders, fines, receivership, conservatorship, removal of officers and directors, emergency closures, dissolution and liquidation.
Federal Banking Regulation
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (1) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (2) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets, (3) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors’, trustees’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage or bankers’ blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, or (4) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met.
Subject to certain regulatory exceptions, FDIC regulations provide that an insured state-chartered bank may not, directly, or indirectly through a subsidiary, engage as “principal” in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank unless the FDIC has determined that such activities would pose no risk to the insurance fund of which it is a member and the bank is in compliance with applicable regulatory capital requirements.
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to 
28


risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. These capital standards were effective January 1, 2015 as a result of a final rule issued by the federal banking agencies to implement certain recommendations of the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FRB takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 
The FRB has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution’s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of the particular risks or circumstances. At December 31, 2018, the Bank met each of its capital requirements.
Federal legislation enacted in 2018 requires that the federal banking agencies, including the FRB, establish a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8-10% of average total consolidated assets for qualifying banking organizations with less than $10 billion of assets. Institutions and holding companies with tangible equity (subject to certain adjustments) meeting the specified level and electing to follow the alternative framework would be deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements, and be considered to be “well-capitalized” for purposes of the Prompt Consecutive Action, regulations, discussed in the following section. The agencies have issued a proposed rule that would set the “community bank leverage ratio” at 9%.
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
The applicable FRB regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. Under the amended regulations, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 
29


8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 
The Bank’s capital ratios were all above the minimum levels required for it to be considered a “well capitalized” financial institution at December 31, 2018 under the “prompt corrective action” regulations in effect as of such date.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor. The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assessed based on perceived risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. Originally, each institution was assigned to a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depended upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations, with less risky institutions paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) ranged from 2.5 to 45 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund’s reserve ratio reaching 1.15%, the range of assessments for banks of less than $10 billion in assets was reduced by 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points of total assets less tangible capital, effective July 1, 2016. In addition, the risk categories were eliminated in favor of a combination of examination ratings and financial modeling designed to estimate the probability of such institution’s failure over a three-year period.
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on our operating expenses and results of operations. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
Community Reinvestment Act. Savings banks have a responsibility under the federal Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could result in restrictions on activities and/or denials of applications for transactions such as mergers, acquisitions and branches. The Bank received a “satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recently completed federal examination. 
Connecticut has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA that is also applicable to the Bank. The Connecticut version is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Connecticut law requires the Connecticut Banking Commissioner to consider, but not be limited to, a bank’s record of performance under Connecticut law in considering any application by a bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. The Bank received a "satisfactory" CRA rating in its most recently completed examination under Connecticut law.
Transactions with Related Parties. Federal law limits the Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with “affiliates” (e.g., any entity that controls or is under common control with the Bank, including the Company and their non-savings institution subsidiaries). The aggregate amount of “covered transactions” with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the Bank. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type specified by federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must generally be on terms and under 
30


circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by the Company to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, the Bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (“insiders”), as well as entities such persons control, is limited. The laws limit both the individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on the Bank’s capital level and requires that certain board approval procedures be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional limitations based on the type of loan involved.
Enforcement. The FRB has extensive enforcement authority over the Bank and has authority to bring actions against the Bank and all Bank-affiliated parties, including shareholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on the Bank. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order for removal of officers and/or directors to institution of receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or even $1.0 million per day in especially egregious cases. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which consists of eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. The Bank, as a member of the FHLB, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Boston. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLB stock at December 31, 2018 of $9.0 million.
Federal Reserve System. Under FRB regulations, the Bank is required to maintain reserves against its transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Bank is required to maintain average daily reserves equal to 3% on aggregate transaction accounts of up to $115.1 million, plus 10% on the remainder, and the first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances will both be exempt. These reserve requirements are subject to adjustment by the FRB. The Bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements.
Other Regulations
The Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as, but not limited to, the:

• | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and


• | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies.

The operations of the Bank also are subject to the:

• | The Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires disclosure of deposit terms to consumers;


• | Regulation CC, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers;

31



• | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumers’ financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and


• | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check.

Holding Company Regulation
General. In August 2017, the Company changed status from that of a savings and loan holding company to that of a bank holding company. As a result, the previously applicable requirement that the Bank comply with the Qualified Thrift Lender Test, which required that a specified percentage of assets be in primarily residential mortgage-related investments, was eliminated.
The Company is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any other bank or bank holding company. Prior FRB approval would be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company.
A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the FRB has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (1) making or servicing loans; (2) performing certain data processing services; (3) providing discount brokerage services; (4) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; and (5) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being “well capitalized” and “well managed” as defined in the regulations, to opt to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities. Such activities can include insurance and investment banking. The Company has elected to become a financial holding company.
The status of the Company as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.
Dividends and Repurchases. Federal regulations require a bank holding company to give the FRB prior written notice of any repurchase or redemption of outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the repurchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such repurchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption under certain circumstances. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. Federal Reserve policy provides for regulatory consultation prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments under specified circumstances regardless of the applicability of the previously referenced notification requirement. The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial 
32


condition. This policy statement also provides for regulatory consultation before a holding company pays dividends or redeems or repurchases shares of common stock under certain circumstances. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Source of Strength. Under FRB policy, a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength for its subsidiary bank. Under this policy, the FRB may require, and has required in the past, a holding company to provide capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
Capital Requirements. The FRB has adopted regulatory capital requirements that are generally applicable to holding companies with $1.0 billion or more in consolidated assets. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FRB to revise its holding company capital requirements so that they are no less stringent, quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions themselves. The previously discussed final rule which revised regulatory capital requirements for depository institutions also implemented the Dodd-Frank requirements for holding companies. Holding companies of $1.0 billion or more in consolidated assets are now subject to regulatory capital requirements that are identical to those applicable to the institutions themselves. As is the case with the institution-level requirements, the capital conservation buffer was phased in from 2016 to 2019.
Acquisition of Control. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company unless the FRB has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances.
Federal Income Taxation
General. The Company reports its income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The federal income tax laws apply to the Company in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions, particularly the Bank’s reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. With limited exception, the Company is no longer subject to United States federal, state and local income tax examinations by the tax authorities for the years prior to 2015. The Company’s maximum federal income tax rate was 21.0% for 2018.
On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"). The Act included a number of changes in existing law impacting, among other things, a permanent reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. 
Bad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning before June 30, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the Internal Revenue Code were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method. The reserve for non-qualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in 1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts for institutions with assets in excess of $500.0 million and the percentage of taxable income method for all institutions for tax years beginning after 1995 and required savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves. However, those tax-based bad debt reserves accumulated prior to 1988 (“Base Year Reserves”) were not required to be recaptured unless the institution failed certain tests. Approximately $4.7 million of the Bank’s accumulated tax-based bad debt reserves would not be recaptured into taxable income unless it makes a “non-dividend distribution” to the Company as described below.
Distributions. If the Bank makes “non-dividend distributions” to the Company, the distributions will be considered to have been made from the Bank’s unrecaptured tax-based bad debt reserves, including the balance of its Base Year Reserves as of December 31, 1987, to the extent of the “non-dividend distributions,” and then from the Bank’s supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent of those reserves, and an amount based on the 
33


amount distributed, but not more than the amount of those reserves, will be included in the Bank’s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank’s current and accumulated earnings and profits as calculated for federal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid out of the Bank’s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be included in the Bank’s taxable income.
The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Therefore, if the Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to the Company, approximately one and one-third times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 21% federal corporate income tax rate. The Bank does not intend to pay non-dividend distributions that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves.
State Income Taxation
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the Connecticut corporation business tax.  The Company and its subsidiaries are required to file a combined Connecticut income tax return and pay the regular corporation business tax.  The Connecticut corporation business tax is based on the federal taxable income before net operating loss and special deductions of the Company and its subsidiaries and makes certain modifications to federal taxable income to arrive at Connecticut taxable income. Connecticut taxable income is multiplied by the state tax rate (8.25% for fiscal year 2018) to arrive at Connecticut income tax.
In May 1998, the State of Connecticut enacted legislation permitting the formation of passive investment company subsidiaries by financial institutions.  This legislation exempts qualifying passive investment companies from the Connecticut corporation business tax and excludes dividends paid from a passive investment company from the taxable income of the parent financial institution.  The Bank’s formation of a passive investment company in January 1999 substantially eliminates the state income tax expense of the Company and its subsidiaries under current law. See Item 1. Business.  “Subsidiary Activities – SI Mortgage Company” for a discussion of the Bank’s passive investment company.
In addition to Connecticut, the Company also files income tax returns in Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
As a Maryland corporation, the Company is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees to the State of Maryland.
