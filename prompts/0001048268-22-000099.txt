Item 1. Business 
OVERVIEW
IES Holdings, Inc. designs and installs integrated electrical and technology systems and provides infrastructure products and services to a variety of end markets, including data centers, residential housing and commercial and industrial facilities. Our operations are organized into four business segments, based upon the nature of our services:
•Communications – Nationwide provider of technology infrastructure services, including the design, build, and maintenance of the communications infrastructure within data centers for co-location and managed hosting customers, for both large corporations and independent businesses.
•Residential – Regional provider of electrical installation services for single-family housing and multi-family apartment complexes, as well as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and plumbing installation services in certain markets.
•Infrastructure Solutions – Provider of electro-mechanical solutions for industrial operations, including apparatus repair and custom-engineered products, such as generator enclosures used in data centers and other industrial applications. 
•Commercial & Industrial – Provider of electrical and mechanical design, construction, and maintenance services to the commercial and industrial markets in various regional markets and nationwide in certain areas of expertise, such as the power infrastructure market and data centers.
While sharing common goals and values, each of the Company’s segments manages its own day-to-day operations. Our corporate office is focused on significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and selection of segment leadership. The corporate office also assists with strategic and operational improvement initiatives, talent development, sharing of best practices across the organization and the establishment and monitoring of risk management practices within our segments.
IES Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware corporation established in 1997 and headquartered in Houston, Texas, with an executive office in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
CORPORATE STRATEGY
We seek to create shareholder value by growing our business through increasing our market share, geographic and market expansion and adding to our capabilities, as well as improving operating margins and generating free cash flow, by investing in our existing businesses and completing acquisitions. We primarily seek to acquire businesses that strategically complement our existing business segments. In addition, we may seek to acquire or invest in stand-alone platform companies based in North America. In evaluating potential acquisition candidates, we seek to invest in businesses with, among other characteristics: 
•proven management with a willingness to continue post-acquisition;
•low technological and/or product obsolescence risk;
•established market position and sustainable competitive advantages; and
•strong cash flow characteristics.
We believe that acquisitions provide an opportunity to expand into new or related services, products, end markets or geographic areas and diversify our revenue and profit streams. While we may use acquisitions to build our presence in the industries we serve, we will also consider potential acquisitions in other industries, which could result in changes in our operations from those historically conducted by us.

For additional financial information by segment, see Note 11, “Operating Segments” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Communications
Business Description
Originally established in 1984, our Communications segment is a leading provider of network infrastructure solutions for data centers and other mission critical environments. Our services include the design, installation and maintenance of network infrastructure for leading and recognizable global technology, social networking and e-commerce brands, including many Fortune 100 and 500 corporations. We serve a variety of industries and end markets, including data centers for co-location and managed hosting customers; corporate, educational, financial, hospitality and healthcare buildings; e-commerce distribution centers; and high-tech manufacturing facilities. We also provide the design and installation of audio/visual, telephone, fire, wireless access and intrusion alarm systems, as well as design/build, service and maintenance of data network systems. We perform services across the United States from our 19 offices, which includes the segment headquarters located in Tempe, Arizona, and also provide dedicated onsite teams at our customers’ sites. 
Industry Overview
Our Communications segment is driven by demand for computing and storage resources as a result of technology advancements and obsolescence and changes in data consumption patterns. Demand in the data center market remains strong, and we continue to provide structured cabling services for applications such as data centers, distribution centers, and high-tech manufacturing facilities. Additionally, we are continuing to expand our offerings in this market to broaden our customer base. Demand has also been strong for our audio-visual and other building technology offerings. At September 30, 2022, our Communications business has a record level of backlog. However, if customers in our end markets reduce their capital budgets due to economic, technological or other factors, this could result in a decrease in activity for our Communications segment.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales strategy relies on a concentrated business development effort, with centralized marketing programs and direct end-customer communications and relationships. Due to the mission critical nature of the facilities we service, our end-customers significantly rely upon our past performance record, technical expertise and specialized knowledge. A significant portion of our Communications business volume is generated from long-term, repeat customers, some of whom use IES as a preferred provider for major projects.
Our long-term strategy is to improve our position as a preferred solutions and services provider to large national corporations and strategic local companies. Key elements of our long-term strategy include continued investment in our employees’ technical expertise and expansion of our on-site maintenance and recurring revenue model, as well as opportunistic acquisitions of businesses that serve our markets, consistent with our stated corporate strategy.
Competition
Our competition consists of both large national or regional competitors and small, privately owned contractors who generally have limited access to capital. We compete on quality of service and/or price and seek to emphasize our financial capabilities and long history of delivering high quality solutions to our customers.
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
The effects of seasonality on our Communications business are not significant, as work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather. Our service and maintenance business is also generally not affected by seasonality. However, communications infrastructure spending has historically been highly cyclical. Our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions. Quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects. Accordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period.
Residential
Business Description
Originally established in 1973, our Residential segment is a leading provider of electrical installation services for single-family housing and multi-family apartment complexes, as well as HVAC and plumbing installation services in certain markets, and cable television installations for residential and light commercial applications. The Residential segment also provides services for the installation of residential solar power, both for new construction and existing residences. The Residential segment is made up of 77 total locations, which include the segment headquarters in Houston, Texas. These locations geographically cover the Sun-Belt, Western, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions of the United States. 
Industry Overview
Our Residential business is closely correlated to the single and multi-family housing market. Although demand for both single-family and multi-family housing has increased in recent years, due to economic, technological or other factors, there can be no assurance that overall construction and demand will continue to increase in the future. Entering fiscal 2023, we expect continued revenue growth in our multi-family business as our strong backlog is expected to offset much of he expected impact of demand weakness in the single-family market, where we typically do not enter into long-term contracts.
Sales and Marketing
Demand for our Residential services is highly dependent on the number of single-family and multi-family home starts in the markets we serve. Although we operate in multiple states, the majority of our single-family revenues are derived from services provided in Texas and Florida. The Texas market also remains an important part of our multi-family business; however, the majority of our multi-family revenue is earned across the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. Our sales efforts include a variety of strategies, including a concentrated focus on national and regional homebuilders and multi-family developers and a local sales strategy for single and multi-family housing projects. Our cable and solar revenues are typically generated through third parties specializing in these industries who select us as a preferred provider of installation services. A significant portion of our Residential business volume is generated from long-term, repeat customers, some of whom use IES as a preferred provider for major projects.
Our long-term strategy is to continue to be a leading provider of electrical services to the residential market, and to continue to expand our offerings of plumbing and HVAC services. The key elements of our long-term strategy include a continued focus on maintaining a low and variable cost structure and cash generation, allowing us to effectively scale according to the housing cycle, and to opportunistically increase our market share.
Competition
Our competition primarily consists of small, privately owned contractors who generally have limited access to capital. We believe that we have a competitive advantage over these smaller competitors due to our key employees’ long-standing customer relationships, our financial capabilities, our employee training program, and our local market knowledge and competitive pricing. There are few barriers to entry for electrical contracting services in the residential markets. 
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
Results of operations from our Residential segment can be seasonal, depending on weather trends, with typically higher revenues generated during spring and summer and lower revenues during fall and winter. In addition, the construction industry has historically been highly cyclical. Our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in multi-family occupancy rates as well as single-family housing starts within our operational footprint. Quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects. Accordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period.
Infrastructure Solutions
Business Description
Our Infrastructure Solutions segment provides electro-mechanical solutions for industrial operations to domestic and international customers. Our Custom Power Solutions business includes the manufacture of custom commercial and industrial generator enclosures and the manufacture of custom-engineered power distribution equipment, including metal enclosed bus duct solutions used in power distribution. Our Industrial Services business includes the maintenance and repair of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) electric motors and generators, as well as power generating and distribution equipment; the manufacture, re-manufacture, and repair of industrial lifting magnets; and maintenance and repair of railroad main and auxiliary generators, main alternators, and traction motors. 
This segment serves the steel, railroad, marine, petrochemical, pipeline, pulp and paper, wind energy, mining, automotive, power generation, scrap yards, data center, and utility industries. Our Infrastructure Solutions segment is comprised of 13 locations in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, and is headquartered in Massillon, Ohio. 
Industry Overview
Given the diverse end-markets of Infrastructure Solutions’ customers, we are subject to many economic trends. In general, demand for our services has been driven by growth in industries, such as data centers, in-house maintenance departments continuing to outsource maintenance and repair work, output levels and equipment utilization at heavy industrial facilities, railroad companies’ and mass transit authorities’ capital investments and repair needs, investment in the United States’ aging energy and industrial infrastructure, demand for critical power applications that have high power demands and require dependable power supplies, the need for electrical or pipeline infrastructure improvements and the overall health of the economy.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales efforts are primarily driven by personnel based at our operating locations, as well as independent sales representatives. Our custom-engineered power distribution, bus system and generator enclosure products and services are principally sold in partnership with an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) or to an engineering, procurement and construction firm on behalf of the end-user. Regarding our apparatus repair services, the majority of our customers are located within a 200-mile radius of our facilities, and we believe that the locations of our facilities allow us to rapidly address and respond to the needs of our customers. Our long-term strategy is to be a leader in custom-engineered metal enclosed bus systems and generator enclosures and the preferred solutions provider of outsourced electro-mechanical services, repairs, and manufacturing to our select markets.
Competition
Our competition ranges from small, single location service centers to large, multi-national companies. Our Custom Power Solutions business competes with domestic and international manufacturers and distributors. We believe that we have a competitive advantage due to our specific product offerings, geographic proximity to customer sites, and our ability to design high quality products to meet each customer's unique requirements. Our Industrial Services business competes with small, specialized manufacturing and repair shops, a limited number of other multi-location providers of electric motor repair, engineering and maintenance services, and various OEMs. Participants in this industry compete primarily on the basis of capabilities, service, quality, timeliness and price. We believe that we have a competitive advantage due to our breadth of capabilities, focus on quality, technical support, customer service, and financial resources. 
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
Infrastructure Solutions’ revenues from its custom-engineered bus systems and generator enclosures are affected by the timing of customers' capital spending projects. Revenues from industrial services may be affected by the timing of scheduled outages at its industrial customers’ facilities and by weather conditions with respect to projects conducted outdoors, but the effects of seasonality on revenues in its industrial services business are not significant. Infrastructure Solutions’ quarterly results may fluctuate, and the results of one fiscal quarter may not be representative of the results of any other quarter or of the full fiscal year.
Commercial & Industrial
Business Description
Our Commercial & Industrial segment provides electrical and mechanical design, service, and construction services to commercial and industrial markets. Our construction services range from the initial planning and procurement to installation and start-up and are offered to a variety of new and remodel construction projects, ranging from the construction of office buildings and industrial facilities to transmission and distribution projects. Our design services range from budget assistance to providing design-build and LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) solutions to our end customers. Our maintenance and emergency services include critical plant shutdown, troubleshooting, emergency testing, preventative maintenance, and constant presence. We also provide 
mechanical services such as maintenance agreements, installation, or replacement of mechanical equipment for commercial and industrial facilities.
This segment provides services for a variety of project types, including office buildings, manufacturing facilities, data centers, chemical plants, refineries, wind farms, solar facilities, municipal infrastructure and health care facilities. The Commercial & Industrial segment consists of 19 locations, which includes the segment headquarters in Houston, Texas. Geographically, these locations cover Texas, Nebraska, Oregon, Wisconsin, and the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.
Industry Overview
Given the diverse end markets of our Commercial & Industrial customers, which include both commercial buildings, such as offices, healthcare facilities and schools, and industrial projects, such as power, agricultural and food processing, and heavy manufacturing facilities, we are subject to many trends within the construction industry. In general, demand for our Commercial & Industrial services is driven by construction and renovation activity levels, economic growth, and availability of bank or other financing. Due to economic, technological or other factors, there can be no assurance that construction and demand will increase. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales focus varies by location, but is primarily based upon regional and local relationships and a demonstrated expertise in certain areas, such as heavy industrial, design-build, agricultural, or transmission and distribution. Our maintenance and certain renovation and upgrade work tends to be either recurring or experience lower sensitivity to economic cycles, or both. A significant portion of our larger projects is awarded from long-term, repeat customers. From time to time, we are contracted on projects with completion times extending beyond one year or over several years, which are generally more complex and difficult to estimate.
Competition
The electrical and mechanical contracting services industry is generally highly competitive and includes a number of regional or small privately-held local firms. Traditionally, competitors in certain parts of this market have faced few barriers to entry. Therefore, we seek to pursue projects where our access to capital and expertise provide a competitive advantage.
Industry expertise, project size, location and past performance determine our bidding strategy, the level of involvement from competitors and our level of success in bidding for new work. Our primary advantages vary by location and market, but mostly are based upon local individual relationships with key customers or a demonstrated industry expertise. Additionally, due to the size of many of our projects, our financial resources help us compete effectively against local competitors. 
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
The effects of seasonality on our Commercial & Industrial business are not significant, as most of our work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather. However, we do perform some work outdoors, which can be affected by the weather. Most of our service and maintenance business is also generally not affected by seasonality. However, the construction industry has historically been highly cyclical. Our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in construction projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions. Quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects. Accordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period.
SOURCES OF SUPPLY
The raw materials and components we use within our segments include, but are not limited to, electrical fixtures and system components, copper, aluminum, raw steel, and certain plastics. These raw materials and components are generally available from a variety of domestic suppliers at competitive prices. Delivery times are typically short for most raw materials and standard components, but during periods of peak demand, may extend to one month or more. However, during fiscal 2021 and 2022, supply chain interruptions became increasingly common, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Although supply of most raw materials has begun to normalize, we continue to experience delays in sourcing certain components. Such delays may lead to project inefficiencies resulting from schedule extensions. We are also exposed to increases in the prices of certain commodities. Our strategy to reduce commodity cost exposure includes early buying of commodities for particular projects or general inventory, as well as including escalation and escape provisions in project bids, quotes and contracts wherever possible. However, such protections are not included in every contract or project, and in such cases, we may not be fully reimbursed for increases in commodity prices by our customers and may be exposed to commodity price volatility on longer-term projects where we have prepaid for commodities.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The primary risks in our existing operations include project bidding and management, bodily injury, property and environmental damage, and construction defects. We monitor project bidding and management practices at various levels within the Company. We maintain automobile, general liability and construction defect insurance for third-party health, bodily injury and property damage, as well as pollution coverage and workers’ compensation coverage, which we consider appropriate to insure against these risks. Our third-party insurance is subject to deductibles for which we establish reserves. In light of these risks, we are also committed to a strong safety and environmental compliance culture. We have a robust safety program, and seek to maintain standardized safety and environmental policies and procedures. We are also subject to cyber security and information theft risks in our operations, which we seek to manage through a cyber and information security program, training and insurance coverage. Given the dynamic and evolving nature of cyber threats, we cannot be assured that we are protected against all such threats.
In the electrical contracting industry, our ability to post surety bonds provides us with an advantage over competitors that are smaller or have fewer financial resources. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet, as well as a good relationship with our bonding providers, enhances our ability to obtain adequate financing and surety bonds, although there can be no assurance that surety bonding coverage will be available when we need it. For a further discussion of our risks, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
CUSTOMERS
We have a diverse customer base. During each of the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. We emphasize developing and maintaining relationships with our customers by providing superior, high-quality service. Management at each of our segments is responsible for determining sales strategies and sales activities. 
CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER
A majority of our outstanding common stock is owned by Tontine Associates, L.L.C. ("Tontine Associates") and its affiliates (collectively, “Tontine”). Tontine owns approximately 57 percent of our outstanding common stock based on a Form 4 filed by Tontine with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on December 3, 2021, and the Company's shares outstanding as of December 2, 2022. As a result, Tontine can control most of our affairs, including most actions requiring the approval of shareholders, such as the approval of any potential merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or business segments, or the Company itself. Most of Tontine’s shares are registered for resale on a shelf registration statement filed by the Company with the SEC. Tontine’s sale of all or any portion of its shares could result in a change of control of the Company, which would trigger the change of control provisions in a number of our material agreements, including our credit agreement, bonding agreements with our sureties and our executive severance plan. For more information, see Note 3, “Controlling Shareholder” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
NET OPERATING LOSS TAX CARRYFORWARDS 
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have an estimated federal net operating loss (“NOL”) of approximately $61.0 million of federal NOLs that are available to use to offset future taxable income, including approximately $55.1 million resulting from net operating losses on which a deferred tax asset is not recorded at September 30, 2022. A change in ownership, as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 382, could reduce the availability of NOLs for federal and state income tax purposes. Should Tontine sell or otherwise dispose of all or a portion of its position in IES, a change in ownership could occur. In addition, a change in ownership could result from the purchase of common stock by an existing or a new 5% shareholder as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Should a change in ownership occur, all NOLs incurred prior to the change in ownership would be subject to limitation imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which would substantially reduce the amount of NOLs available to offset future taxable income. For more information see Note 3, “Controlling Shareholder” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND BACKLOG
Remaining performance obligations represent the unrecognized revenue value of our contract commitments. While backlog is not a defined term under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), it is a common measurement used in our industry, and we believe it improves our ability to forecast future results and identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. Backlog is a measure of revenue that we expect to recognize from work that has yet to be performed on 
uncompleted contracts and from work that has been contracted but has not started, exclusive of short-term projects. While all of our backlog is supported by documentation from customers, backlog is not a guarantee of future revenues, as contractual commitments may change and our performance may vary. Not all of our work is performed under contracts included in backlog; for example, most of the apparatus repair work that is completed by our Infrastructure Solutions segment is performed under master service agreements on an as-needed basis. Additionally, electrical installation services for single-family housing at our Residential segment are completed on a short-term basis and are therefore excluded from backlog. The table below summarizes our remaining performance obligations and backlog by segment:

 | Year Ended September 30, 
 | 2022 | | 2021 
 | Remaining Performance Obligations | Agreements without an enforceable obligation (1) | Backlog | | Remaining Performance Obligations | Agreements without an enforceable obligation (1) | Backlog
 | (Dollars in millions) 
Communications | $ | 323 | | $ | 63 | | $ | 386 | | $ | 219 | $ | 37 | $ | 256
Residential | 404 | | 120 | | 524 | | | 260 | 78 | | 338
Infrastructure Solutions | 54 | | 121 | | 175 | | | 65 | 63 | | 128
Commercial & Industrial | 186 | | 15 | | 201 | | | 169 | 9 | | 178
Total | $ | 967 | | $ | 319 | | $ | 1,286 | | $ | 713 | $ | 187 | $ | 900

(1) Our backlog includes signed agreements and letters of intent that we do not have a legal right to enforce prior to beginning work. These agreements are excluded from remaining performance obligations until work begins.
We expect that $777 million of our September 30, 2022 backlog will result in revenue during fiscal 2023, with the remaining $510 million expected to be realized in fiscal 2024; however, there can be no assurance that this backlog will be completed within expected time frames or at all. The increase in our backlog year over year was primarily driven by strong demand and increased market share within our all segments. 
REGULATIONS
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including:
•licensing requirements applicable to electricians, plumbers, and mechanical service technicians;
•building and electrical codes;
•regulations relating to worker safety, labor relations and protection of the environment;
•regulations relating to consumer protection, including those governing residential service agreements; and
•qualifications of our business legal structure in the jurisdictions where we do business.
Many state and local regulations governing electricians and mechanical services require permits and licenses to be held by individuals. In some cases, a required permit or license held by a single individual may be sufficient to authorize specified activities for all our electricians or mechanical service technicians who work in the state or county that issued the permit or license. While we seek permits or licenses, where available, that may be material to our operations in a particular geographic area to be held by multiple employees within that area, given the large number of permits and licenses required, we are unable to ensure that multiple employees hold such required permits and licenses.
We believe that we have all licenses required to conduct our operations and are in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses or an inability to perform government work.
CAPITAL FACILITIES

During fiscal year 2022, the Company maintained a revolving credit facility, as further described in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” of this Annual Report 
on Form 10-K. For a discussion of the Company’s capital resources, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
For the Company’s financial information by segment, see Note 11, “Operating Segments” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
At IES, we believe that attracting and retaining highly qualified and motivated employees at all levels is a key driver of our continued growth and success. Our human capital management objectives include recruiting, retaining, developing, incentivizing and integrating our current and prospective employees as well as prioritizing and protecting their safety.
Our Employees
At September 30, 2022, we had 8,078 employees, of which 8,028 were full-time employees. We are party to two collective bargaining agreements covering fewer than 30 employees within our Infrastructure Solutions segment. We have not experienced, and do not expect, any work stoppage, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is strong.
We are committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and our policies prohibit discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, marital status, national origin, disability, protected veteran status and relatives of protected veterans and any other status protected by local, state or federal law. This commitment applies to all aspects of employment, including recruitment, hiring, training, compensation, job assignment, advancement, performance feedback and separation. 
We strive to support our employees’ and their families’ health by offering comprehensive benefits programs, including medical, dental, vision and prescription insurance. We also offer our employees a 401(k) plan, and life and disability insurance plans. 
Recruiting and Training
A key factor in IES’s long-term strategy is the recruitment and retention of high-quality employees. We use both internal and external resources to recruit employees, including monitoring competitive compensation levels in the markets in which we operate. Our Communications segment has entered into a partnership with the U.S. Army to guarantee job interviews to those who have completed Army Reserve training or a first term of active duty service, and we value the leadership and work ethic military veterans bring to the Company.
We have invested significant resources in development opportunities for employees. For example, our Residential segment has established the IES Residential Education Center, a dedicated facility that trains employees from around the country in the technical skills necessary for a successful career in residential electrical contracting. At all of our segments, partly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded online training offerings to help meet the needs of our changing workplaces. We believe our investment in training supports employee motivation and retention at the same time that it improves productivity and performance.
Safety
We are committed to fostering a strong safety culture that supports the health, safety and wellness of our employees, and this commitment is reflected in our track record of workplace safety that exceeds industry averages. Our regional safety managers, under the supervision of our Senior Vice President of Safety, seek to maintain standardized safety and environmental policies, programs and procedures and provide personal protective equipment relevant to each segment, including programs to train new employees. Our safety leadership continuously monitors and addresses safety performance, provides regular training and educational programs on safety and participates in numerous industry safety organizations.
LOCATIONS

As of September 30, 2022, we have 130 domestic locations. In addition to our two executive and corporate offices, as of September 30, 2022, we have 19 locations within our Communications business, 77 locations within our Residential business, 13 locations within our Infrastructure Solutions business and 19 locations within our Commercial & Industrial business. This geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to unfavorable economic developments in any given region.

If we make any substantive amendments to the Code of Ethics or grant any waiver, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of the Code of Ethics to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on that website or in a Current Report on Form 8-K. Paper copies of these documents are also available free of charge upon written request to us.

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments and exhibits to those reports are available free of charge through our website as soon as it is reasonably practicable after we file them with, or furnish them to, the SEC.

In addition to the Code of Ethics for Financial Executives, we have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for directors, officers and employees (the Legal Compliance and Corporate Policy Manual), and established Corporate Governance Guidelines and adopted charters outlining the duties of our Audit, Human Resources and Compensation and Nominating/Governance Committees, copies of which may be found on our website.
