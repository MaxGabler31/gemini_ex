 Item 1. Business
 Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries operate in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the United States, or “U.S.,” and Latin America.
We are a leader and one of the most geographically diverse operators in the motion picture exhibition industry. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 522 theatres and 5,868 screens in the U.S. and Latin America. Our U.S. circuit had 321 theatres and 4,408 screens and our international circuit had 201 theatres and 1,460 screens across 15 countries. Our significant and diverse presence in the U.S. and Latin America has made us an important distribution channel for movie studios and other content providers. We believe our portfolio of modern, high-quality theatres with multiple platforms provides a preferred destination for moviegoers and has contributed to our historically consistent financial performance.
As of December 31, 2021, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments: U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.
 Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the world and the movie exhibition industry. The social and economic effects have been widespread. We temporarily closed our theatres in the U.S. and Latin America beginning in March of 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, we implemented various cash preservation strategies, including, but not limited to, temporary personnel and salary reductions, halting non-essential operating and capital expenditures, negotiating modified timing and/or abatement of contractual payments with landlords and other major suppliers, and the suspension of our quarterly dividend.
 Throughout 2020 and 2021 we reopened theatres as soon as local restrictions and the status of the COVID-19 pandemic would allow. As of December 31, 2021, all of our domestic and international theatres were open. New film content returned in April 2021 and expanded throughout the year leading up to the December release of Spider-Man: No Way Home, which is now an all-time top 10 film in terms of worldwide box office. The industry’s recovery to historical levels of new film content, both in terms of the number of new films and box office performance, is still underway, as the industry also continues to adjust to evolving theatrical release windows, competition from streaming and other delivery platforms, supply chain delays, inflationary pressures, labor shortages, wage rate pressures and other economic factors.
Motion Picture Exhibition Industry Overview
 Domestic
 Preliminary estimates indicate that North American box office revenues were approximately $4.5 billion for 2021, up more than 100% as compared with 2020. Industry statistics continued to improve through 2021 as theatres reopened, new films were released and capacity and other restrictions were removed.
 The following table represents the results of a survey by Motion Picture Association, or MPA, published in March 2021, outlining the historical trends in North American box office performance for the five-year period from 2016 through 2020. Box office performance has historically been primarily dependent on the quality, quantity and timing of film product.

 | North America | | | | 
 | Box Office Revenues | | Attendance | | Average Ticket
Year | ($ in billions) | | (in billions) | | Price 
2016 | $ | 11.4 | | 1.32 | | $ | 8.65
2017 | $ | 11.1 | | 1.24 | | $ | 8.97
2018 | $ | 11.9 | | 1.30 | | $ | 9.11
2019 | $ | 11.4 | | 1.24 | | $ | 9.16
2020 | $ | 2.2 | | 0.24 | | $ | 9.37

Films released during the year ended December 31, 2021 included Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Black Widow, F9: The Fast Saga, Eternals, No Time to Die, A Quiet Place Part II, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Free Guy and Jungle Cruise and Spider-Man: No Way Home, among other films.
Currently, films scheduled for release in 2022 include the highly anticipated sequel Avatar 2, as well as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Thor: Love and Thunder, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, The Batman, Jurassic World: Dominion, Lightyear, Top Gun: Maverick, Minions: The Rise of Gru, Mario, Black Adam, Aquaman 2, Strange World and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, among others. As the industry continues to evolve and recover as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic wanes, film release schedules, the availability and length of exclusive theatrical release windows and streaming release strategies are continuing to evolve and may have a direct impact on industry box office results.
 International
Preliminary estimates for Latin American box office revenues were approximately $1.1 billion for 2021, up more than 100% compared with 2020 and more than 60% below 2019 levels. As noted above, industry results for 2021 are not yet final.
 In addition to the quality, quantity and timing of Hollywood film product, performance in Latin American markets is also impacted by political and social conditions, growing populations, and continued retail development. In many Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile, successful local film product can also contribute to box office revenues. As a result of the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, theatres in certain Latin American countries were subject to phased re-openings, limited operating hours and other capacity limitations during 2021. As of December 31, 2021, all of the Company's international theatres had reopened, though some remained subject to certain capacity and other restrictions. These restrictions are expected to continue to ease as COVID-19 cases decrease and vaccination rates improve in Latin American countries.
Drivers of Continued Industry Success
 Industry dynamics continue to evolve as exhibitors recover from the widespread impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we believe the following factors will continue to drive the strength of our industry:
 Importance of Theatrical Success in Establishing Movie Brands. Theatrical exhibition has long been the primary distribution channel for new major motion picture releases. In addition to representing a significant share of a film’s overall revenues, we believe a successful theatrical release “brands” a film and is one of the major contributors to a film’s success in “downstream” markets, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, network television and streaming as well as theme parks and branded retail merchandise. While some film releases for 2021 did not have a normal exclusive theatrical release window due to temporary theatre closures, limited operating hours and capacity limitations as theatres reopened, and studio efforts to build their streaming platforms’ membership, theatrical exhibition is expected to continue to contribute a meaningful portion of overall studio revenues as demonstrated during 2021. For theatrical releases, we expect most of the studios to observe an exclusive theatrical window, albeit shorter than historical levels, as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic wane.
Convenient and Affordable Form of Premium Out-Of-Home Entertainment. Movie-going remains one of the most convenient and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment. While the average movie ticket price in the U.S. was $9.16 for 2019, average prices for other forms of out-of-home entertainment in the U.S., including sporting events and theme parks, ranged from approximately $32.99 to $102.35 per ticket according to MPA. Industry data for 2021 is not yet available and 2020 data is not representative due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Expansion of Concepts and Product Offerings that Enhance the Movie Viewing Experience. Over recent years, the motion picture exhibition industry has invested in the development of new movie theatre platforms and concepts to respond to varying and changing consumer preferences as well as to differentiate the movie-going experience from other in-home and out-of-home entertainment options. Some examples include changing the overall style and amenities of theatres, including expansion of concession product offerings that provide more variety to traditional popcorn, fountain drinks and candy. Enhanced digital projectors, enhanced sound equipment and motion seats are offered in some locations to create an immersive movie-going experience. New alternative content is expanding the industry’s entertainment offerings to attract a broader customer base. We also developed mobile concessions ordering and delivery-to-seat options.
Our Strategy
 Our primary objective is to attract and expand audiences to maximize attendance and box office, and then pursue other opportunities to capture ancillary revenue. We have continued to focus on providing an extraordinary guest experience, investing in our core circuit and organic growth to accomplish these goals. Our near term focus is to effectively navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, reignite the theatrical exhibition industry and evolve our business for post-pandemic success. As always, we continue to keep the safety of our employees, guests and communities a key priority.
Our long-term strategies include:
 Provide an Extraordinary Guest Experience. We differentiate our theatres by focusing on various initiatives that continuously enhance the in-theatre guest experience. We adapt our theatre amenities to each market, which may include Luxury Lounger recliner seats, our own premium large format, XD, expanded food and beverage offerings and Snacks In A Tap mobile concessions ordering. Investments in these amenities allow us to create and maintain a high-quality theatrical experience throughout our circuit. We believe our ongoing focus on providing an extraordinary in-theatre guest experience is a primary factor of our consistent industry-leading results.
Enhance Overall Guest Engagement. Consistent investment in our website and mobile application features, customized guest interactive functionality and our loyalty and subscription programs provide a personalized experience to our guests. We pursue a wide range of strategic marketing initiatives to communicate and build consumer awareness to better understand the unique preferences of our guests and enrich their movie-going experience.
Pursue Organic and Synergistic Growth Opportunities While Maintaining Core Circuit. We have consistently reinvested our cash flows from operations in our circuit with a focus on new and exciting ways to attract guests. In addition to our Luxury Lounger recliner seats and premium large format XD auditoriums, we have incorporated premium concepts such as full bars and dine-in options. We selectively build or acquire new theatres in markets where we can establish and maintain a strong market position. We built seven theatres with 70 screens during 2021. We will continue to be opportunistic and make quality investments that meet our return on investment criteria while prioritizing our liquidity needs.
Competitive Strengths
 We believe the following strengths have allowed us to compete effectively in the past, helped us navigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and will be guiding principles as we continue to recover from the impacts of the pandemic:
 Disciplined Operating Philosophy. Our balanced and disciplined investment approach centers on thoughtfully reinvesting in our existing theatres, building new theatres and acquiring theatres that will complement our circuit and offer a meaningful return. Our operating philosophy focuses on creating an extraordinary guest experience, maintaining favorable theatre-level economics, controlling operating costs and effectively reacting to economic and market changes.
We have long believed in the combination of a strong balance sheet and ensuring our capital investments earn a solid return. This philosophy has proven to be successful and helped us enter the COVID-19 pandemic in a healthy financial position. We were disciplined with our cash management and liquidity strategies as we navigated through the temporary closure of our theatres and during the phased reopening of our theatres. As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are focused on refortifying our balance sheet, while still investing in long-term growth opportunities. We continue to evaluate the performance of our existing circuit and carefully consider closing underperforming theatres if more favorable results cannot be achieved.
 Leading Position in Our U.S. and Latin American Markets.  We have a leading market share in most of the U.S. markets we serve, which includes a presence in 42 states. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we ranked either first or second, based on box office revenues, in 20 of our top 25 U.S. markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Dallas, Houston, Salt Lake City, Sacramento, Cleveland, Austin and Las Vegas. During 2021, we held our leadership position as we were one of the first circuits to begin reopening theatres in the U.S., gaining market share of the overall North American box office as a result. We retained a meaningful portion of that market share growth throughout 2021.


We have successfully established a significant presence in major cities in Latin America, with theatres in 15 of the 20 largest metropolitan areas in South America. We are the largest exhibitor in Brazil and Argentina and have significant market presence in Colombia, Peru and Chile. Our geographic diversity makes us an important global distribution channel for the movie studios. While our performance during 2020 and 2021 was impacted by the temporary closure of our theatres, we gained overall market share in Latin America as we reopened all of our theatres during 2021. We have retained a meaningful portion of that market share growth as additional new film content was released throughout 2021.
 State-of-the-Art Theatre Circuit. We build new theatres and consistently invest in our existing theatres to maintain a state-of-the-art movie-going experience, which we believe makes our theatres preferred destinations for moviegoers in our markets. We will continue to be opportunistic and make quality investments in our circuit while prioritizing our liquidity needs.
We offer our guests a premium large format experience through our 16 IMAX auditoriums across our worldwide circuit and our 281 XD auditoriums represent the largest exhibitor-branded premium large format footprint in the industry. Our XD auditoriums offer a premium experience utilizing the latest in digital projection and enhanced custom sound, including Barco Auro-Max 11.1 sound systems in select locations. The XD experience includes wall-to-wall screens, wrap-around sound, plush seating and a maximum comfort entertainment environment for an immersive experience. The benefits of our XD auditoriums include program flexibility, as we can show the content of our choice with no additional revenue share component outside of routine film rental. We plan to continue adding new XD locations and second XD screens to certain existing domestic locations during 2022.
We have started a multi-year project to strategically convert our auditoriums to Cinionic RGB laser projectors, further enhancing the movie-going experiences. We have also incorporated Luxury Lounger recliner seats into all of our recent domestic new builds and have repositioned many of our existing domestic theatres to offer this premium seating feature. We currently feature Luxury Loungers in 2,870 domestic auditoriums, representing more than 65% of our domestic circuit.
We currently have auditoriums that offer seats with immersive cinematic motion, which we refer to as motion seats, in 124 theatres throughout our circuit. These motion seats are programmed in harmony with the audio and video content of the film and further immerse guests into the on-screen action.
We offer enhanced food and beverages such as gourmet pizzas, burgers, and sandwiches, and a selection of beers, wine and cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums, at a majority of our theatres. We also offer full bars or dine-in areas in many of our locations and we will continue to expand these amenities to additional locations. In the U.S., we offer mobile concession ordering called Snacks In A Tap at nearly all of our U.S. theatres allowing guests to pre-pay for select concession products and pick them up at the concession stand upon arrival or have them delivered to their seat. We plan to expand mobile concession ordering and delivery to seat to our Latin American theatres in 2022.
Experienced Management. Led by Chairman and founder Lee Roy Mitchell, President and Chief Executive Officer Sean Gamble, Chief Financial Officer Melissa Thomas, President International Valmir Fernandes, and Executive Vice President and General Counsel Michael Cavalier, our global operational management team has extensive industry experience. Additionally, our country general managers are local citizens familiar with political, social, cultural and economic factors impacting their country, which enables them to more effectively manage the local business. Our global management team has successfully navigated us through many industry and economic cycles over the years, and their leadership in steering the Company during the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to their abilities and effectiveness as stewards of the Company.

Theatre Operations
 As of December 31, 2021, we operated 522 theatres and 5,868 screens in 42 U.S. states and 15 Latin American countries.
We opened our first theatre in the U.S. in 1984. Our domestic circuit has expanded primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions. We currently have theatres in 105 designated market areas, or DMAs. We first entered Latin America when we opened a theatre in Santiago, Chile in 1993. Since then, through our focused international growth strategy, we have developed one of the most geographically diverse theatre circuits in the region. We have balanced our risk through a diversified international portfolio, which includes theatres in 15 of the 20 largest metropolitan areas in South America. We have established significant presence in Brazil and Argentina, where we are the largest exhibitor. We also have significant market presence in Colombia, Peru and Chile.
The following table summarizes the geographic locations of our theatre circuit as of December 31, 2021.

 Content
We offer a variety of content at our theatres. During 2021, we transitioned back from primarily offering library content to offering new releases as they became available. We also continued to offer our guests the ability to select a film for private viewing with our Private Watch Parties in a group of up to 20 family members and friends.
 We monitor upcoming films and other content and work diligently with film distributors to license content that we believe will be most successful in our theatres. We play mainstream films from many different genres, such as animated films, family films, dramas, comedies, horror and action films. We offer content in both 2-D and 3-D formats in all of our theatres, and in many locations, we offer either our own premium large format, XD or IMAX. We also offer a format that features motion seats and added sensory features.
 We regularly play art and independent films at many of our U.S. theatres and offer local film product in our international markets, providing a variety of film choices to our guests. We have historically offered a classic series, which involves playing digitally re-mastered classic movies from a variety of genres, at a majority of our U.S. theatres and some of our international theatres during non-peak times. We exhibit a variety of multi-cultural foreign language films, e-sports gaming events and private gaming parties in our theatres.
 Our joint venture, AC JV, LLC, with Regal Entertainment Group, or Regal, and AMC Entertainment, Inc., or AMC, provides marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming through Fathom Events to movie theatres to augment theatres’ feature film schedules, which includes the Metropolitan Opera, sports programs, concert events, and other special presentations, that may be live or pre-recorded. We continue to explore new ways to utilize our theatre platform to provide new content to our guests, including electronic gaming events, traditional sports and other live and pre-recorded events.
Film Licensing
 In the U.S., our corporate film department negotiates with film distributors to license films for each of our domestic theatres. Local film personnel in each of our international offices negotiate with local offices of major film distributors, local film distributors and independent content providers to license films for our international theatres.

Film distributors determine film release dates and film marketing campaigns and the related expenditures, while we are responsible for booking the films at each of our theatres at the optimal showtimes for our guests.
In both our domestic and international locations, film rental fees are based on a film’s box office receipts. The majority of film rental rates are negotiated on a sliding scale formula, under which the rate is based on a standard rate matrix that is established prior to a film’s theatrical run. We negotiate other film rental rates on a firm terms formula, a percentage of box office receipts negotiated prior to a film’s theatrical run, or a rate that is negotiated after a film’s theatrical run.
Food and Beverage
Concession sales are our second largest revenue source. We have expanded concession sales by enhancing our offerings and adapting to our customers’ changing preferences, as discussed below.
Product Mix. Our core concession products offered at all of our theatres include various sizes and types of popcorn, soft drinks, coffees, non-carbonated drinks, candy and quickly-prepared or pre-prepared food, such as hot dogs, pizza, pretzel bites, nachos and ice cream. Our food and beverage offerings may vary based on consumer preferences in a particular market. We offer beverage options for our guests including beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages, freshly-made Pizza Hut pizzas, burgers and sandwiches, as well as some healthier snacks, in many of our theatres and we also offer diverse ethnic foods based on market demographics.
Our point-of-sale systems allow our category managers to monitor product sales and make adjustments to product mix on a theatre-by-theatre or market-by-market basis. This program flexibility also allows us to efficiently activate and manage both national or regional product launches and promotional initiatives to further grow food and beverage sales.
Pricing. New products and promotions are introduced on a regular basis to increase concession purchase incidence by existing consumers as well as to attract new consumers. In certain international countries and in all of our domestic theatres, we offer a free loyalty program that routinely offers food and beverage discounts. Our paid subscription programs, including Movie Club and Movie Club Platinum in the US, allow our guests to receive exclusive concessions discounts.
 Staff Training. Employees are continually trained in proper sales techniques, food preparation and handling and maintaining concession product quality. Some of our product promotions include a motivational element, such as a bonus or commission, that rewards theatre staff for exceptional sales of certain promotional items.
Theatre Design. Our theatres are designed to optimize the guest purchase experience at the concession stands, which includes multiple concession counters throughout a theatre to facilitate serving guests in an expedited manner. We strategically place large concession stands within theatres to heighten visibility, reduce the length of concession lines, and improve traffic flow around the concession stands. We incorporate self-serve candy cases and bottled drink coolers at our traditional crew-serve theatres to help provide convenience for our guests, drive impulse purchases and increase product availability for these two core categories. We also have self-service cafeteria-style concession areas in many of our domestic theatres, which allow customers to select their own refreshments and proceed to the cash register when they are ready. This design allows for more efficient service, and superior visibility of concession items. We also have lobby bars and VIP lounges in many domestic and international theatres.
 Our proprietary Snacks in a Tap online concessions ordering capability allows moviegoers to purchase their cinema snacks in advance and have them waiting to be picked up upon arrival or delivered directly to their seat. This functionality streamlines the guest experience as it transitions from digital to in-theatre, and results in significant added convenience and enhanced guest service for customers. As of December 31, 2021, Snacks in a Tap can be used at virtually all of our U.S. theatres. Additionally, guests in our international locations can pre-pay for select concession products online or at kiosks within the theatre and pick them up at the concession stand. We plan to introduce delivery to guests at their seats in our international locations in 2022.
Cost Control. We negotiate prices, volume-based rebates and promotional-based rebates for concession supplies directly with concession vendors. Concession supplies are generally managed through a distribution network, with theatres placing and receiving orders directly. We monitor inventory levels at every theatre to ensure proper stock levels are maintained to appropriately serve our guests.


Supply chain interruptions inflationary pressures are increasing costs and limiting product availability in the near term. We source products from a variety of partners around the world to minimize supply chain interruptions and price increases, wherever possible.
 Screen Advertising
 Our U.S. theatres are part of the in-theatre digital network operated by National CineMedia, LLC, or NCM. NCM provides advertising to our theatres through its branded “Noovie” pre-show entertainment program and also handles lobby promotions and displays for our theatres. We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCM’s network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach our audience. We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network and also earn screen rental revenue on a per patron basis or revenue share basis depending on the placement of the advertisement. As of December 31, 2021, we had an approximate 26% ownership interest in NCM. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investment in NCM.
 Throughout our international markets, we have established our Flix Media brand that handles screen advertising functions in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Central America, Colombia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Ecuador and Curacao. Our Flix Media marketing personnel work with local agencies and advertisers to coordinate screen advertising in our theatres as well as other theatres in our markets. In addition to screen advertising in our theatres, we continue to expand Flix Media’s services to include, among other things, alternative content, digital media and other synergistic media opportunities. In a few of our other international markets, we outsource our screen advertising to local companies who have established relationships with local advertisers that provide similar programming benefits. The terms of our international screen advertising contracts vary by country; however, we generally earn a percentage of the screen advertising revenues for access to our screens.
Marketing and Promotions
 Our investment in digital marketing and customer experience over the past several years has enabled us to expand our reach to our guests, communicate with them on a consistent basis, and streamline their digital customer journey. We continue to adapt our capabilities and strategies to engage movie-goers more effectively and make it as compelling and simple as possible for them to purchase their next movie ticket and accompanying concessions from us. Through organic and paid marketing efforts, we kept our millions of guests informed through email, social media, website and mobile app updates, and advertising to promote upcoming content and keep Cinemark elevated in the moviegoer consideration set. This was critical to raise awareness as our final theatres reopened in the first half of 2021 and to maintain interest throughout the year as daily lives returned closer to normal.
 Transforming the digital customer journey enables us to more effectively reach movie-goers through targeted and refined search engine optimization, and gives the customer a better experience once they are directed to our website or app. We regularly conduct comprehensive analysis of the search and ticket purchase processes on our channels, making updates that reduce clicks and decrease the friction from search to ticket purchase. Regular enhancements result in driving higher traffic volume to our digital channels and increased ticket purchases.
In an effort to more deeply engage with our guests, the visual identity and physical flow of our theatres are regularly assessed. This includes paying close attention and keeping all signage, merchandise, food and beverage vessels and employee attire updated and reflective of the modern experience.
We market our theatres and special events, including new theatre grand openings, remodel openings and VIP events, using email, digital advertising, and radio and television advertising spots. We exhibit previews of coming attractions and current films as part of our on-screen pre-feature program. We offer guests access to movie times, the ability to buy their tickets and reserve their seats in advance and purchase gift cards at our website www.cinemark.com and via our mobile applications. Guests can subscribe to our emails and push notifications to receive information about current and upcoming films at their preferred Cinemark theatre(s), including details about upcoming XD movies, advanced ticket sales, screenings, special events, concerts, live broadcasts, contests, promotions, and our latest concessions and merchandise offerings. We partner with film distributors on a regular basis to promote upcoming films through local, regional and national programs that are exclusive to our theatres.
 In the evolution of our external communication, we are meeting movie-goers where they are and ensuring we are present as they scroll throughout the day. We interact with moviegoers every day on social media platforms, such

as Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and Tik Tok to provide advanced ticketing, promotions, and event information and to monitor and respond to guests’ questions and feedback.
Our subscription membership program for our domestic circuit, Movie Club, offers guests a standard monthly ticket credit, member-pricing for a companion ticket and concession and other transaction discounts for their choice of a monthly or annual fixed price. Movie Club is a unique option to reward our loyal guests and allows us to stay informed of frequent moviegoers’ preferences. In September 2021, we introduced Movie Club Platinum, allowing members with a high visit frequency and/or high volume of ticket purchases during the year to earn additional movie ticket credits, receive an increased concessions discount and the ability to purchase additional tickets at a discounted price.
 We offer a free domestic loyalty program to our guests, named Movie Fan. Movie Fan allows our moviegoers to earn one point for every dollar they spend. Points can then be redeemed for tickets, concession items and discounts, as well as unique and limited-edition rewards that relate to films currently playing in our theatres. Our loyalty programs are closely monitored, and updates are consistently tested to compel consumers to prioritize visiting our theatres.
We also have loyalty programs in some of our international markets that either allow customers to pay a nominal fee for an annual membership card that provides them with certain admissions and concession discounts or that allows guests to earn loyalty points for each purchase. Similar to the Movie Fan program, our points-based international programs offer discounts on movie tickets and concessions. Our global loyalty programs put us in direct contact with our moviegoers and provide additional opportunities for us to partner with the studios and our vendors through targeted promotions.
 Competition
 We are one of the leaders in the motion picture exhibition industry. We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors with respect to attracting guests, licensing films and developing new theatre sites. Our primary U.S. competitors include Regal and AMC and our primary international competitors, which vary by country, include Cinépolis, Cine Colombia, CinePlanet, Kinoplex (GSR), Village Cines, SuperCines and Araujo.
 We are generally able to book films without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors at many of our theatres. In certain limited situations, distributors allocate movies to only one theatre in a market generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition. In all theatres, our success in attracting guests can depend on customer service quality, location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability and ticket prices.
We compete for new theatre sites with other movie theatre exhibitors as well as other entertainment venues. Securing a potential site depends upon factors such as commercial terms, committed investment and resources, theatre design and capacity, revenue potential and financial stability.
We face competition from other forms of out-of-home entertainment competing for the public’s leisure time and disposable income, such as family entertainment centers, concerts, theme parks and sporting events. We also face competition for guests from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as streaming services, digital downloads, video on-demand and network television.
Seasonality
 Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors. The most successful motion pictures have historically been released during summer months in the U.S., extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from November through year-end. The timing of releases, however, has become less pronounced as distributors have begun releasing content more evenly throughout the year. In our Latin American markets, while Hollywood content has similar release dates as in the U.S., the local holidays and seasons can vary. The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can impact this seasonality trend. The timing, quantity and quality of film releases can have a significant impact on our results of operations, and the results of one period are not necessarily indicative of future results.
Corporate Operations
 Our worldwide headquarters, referred to as the Cinemark Service Center, or CSC, is located in Plano, Texas. Personnel at the CSC provide oversight and support for our domestic and international theatres, and includes our

executive team and department heads in charge of film licensing, food and beverage, theatre operations, theatre construction and maintenance, real estate, human resources, marketing, legal, finance, accounting, tax and information technology. Our U.S. operations are comprised of regions headed by a regional vice president. We have nine regional offices in Latin America responsible for the local management of theatres in fifteen countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Curacao are managed out of one Central American regional office). Each regional office is headed by a general manager or a member of our international management team with additional personnel responsible for film licensing, marketing, human resources, information technology, operations and finance. We have divisional chief financial officers in Brazil and Argentina and a regional chief financial officer located in Chile that oversees Chile, Bolivia and Paraguay.
Human Capital
 Our business is seasonal and therefore, our headcount can vary throughout the year depending on the timing and success of movie releases. While we do not have unionized employees within our domestic employee base, some of our international locations are subject to union regulations.
Our focus upon the reopening of our theatres was to re-hire our hourly team members who were impacted when our theatres first closed. We have reopened all of our domestic and international theatres and we currently have approximately 16,000 employees in the U.S., approximately 25% of whom are full-time employees and 75% of whom are part-time employees. We have approximately 8,700 employees in our international markets, approximately 40% of whom are full-time employees and approximately 60% of whom are part-time employees.
 In our Mission, Vision and Values Statement, our employees form the core of our Cinemark Values. We strive to (i) act with honesty and integrity, respect and care for each other, our guests, communities and partners, (ii) provide a safe environment for our employees and guests, (iii) be the best in what we do and (iv) empower our people to make decisions and take responsibility. Guided by our Cinemark Values, we are committed to creating a company where everyone is included and respected, and where we support each other in reaching our full potential. We take pride in the fact that many of our employees, including executive management, international general managers and field employees, have significant tenure with the Company. Many of the field employees who were initially hired as we started reopening our theatres were employed by us before the pandemic.
 To attract and retain the most qualified talent, we offer competitive benefits, including market-competitive compensation, healthcare, paid time off, parental leave, free movie passes and a 401(k) retirement savings and investment plan with generous Company matching. Additionally, many of our CSC employees are eligible to work on a hybrid remote schedule. We support the continuous development of professional, technical and leadership skills of our employees by offering tuition assistance, skills development courses through partnerships with leading educational institutions, and leadership development and training both generally and as part of our diversity and inclusion initiatives. Employees are encouraged to provide feedback about their experience through periodic employee engagement surveys. These voluntary surveys provide overall and department-specific reports and enables us to improve employee experience and culture. We aspire to provide a safe, open and accountable work environment for our employees. We provide a hotline for all employees to report workplace concerns and violations with the option to report on an anonymous basis. We address such concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our Cinemark Values.
 Regulations
 The distribution of motion pictures is largely regulated by antitrust laws and was the subject of numerous antitrust cases in the past. The manner in which we can license films from certain major film distributors has been influenced by consent decrees and other court orders resulting from these cases. Consent decrees that bound certain major film distributors are set to expire in 2022. These consent decrees required the films of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including Cinemark, on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis. Consequently, exhibitors have not entered into long-term arrangements with major distributors but must negotiate for licenses on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis. While the consent decrees may no longer be in effect, we are still subject to the antitrust laws and do not expect a material shift in the way films are licensed.
 We are subject to various general regulations applicable to our operations including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, and regulations recently issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that require nutrition labels for certain menu items. Our domestic and international theatre operations are also subject to

federal, state and local laws governing such matters as data privacy, wages, working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and various business licensing and permitting.
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be subject to certain restrictions and protocols, which may vary at the city, county and state level.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors
An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.
 Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic
 The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our industry and our business and could continue to materially affect our financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations and ability to service our existing and future indebtedness.
 The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our industry and our business for an extended period of time. While we have reopened all of our theatres as of December 31, 2021, our business, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and financial condition continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the key factors that has materially affected our business is the availability of new films for exhibition at our theatres. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, production of films was temporarily halted or delayed and new film releases were postponed or shifted to streaming services, resulting in a drastic reduction in the volume of new films available for theatrical exhibition. Even when new films are available, certain studios have reduced the window for video and digital releases or released films directly to alternative distribution channels such as streaming services simultaneous with a theatrical release. In addition, studios may determine that certain types of film content will not be released for theatrical exhibition in the future and will go straight to streaming platforms.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic federal, state and local governments implemented restrictions that limited in-person gathering and/or movement of guests. Even as many restrictions have been lifted, consumers may not yet be comfortable gathering in a large group or within a closed space for a few hours at a time, which could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer guests and reduced revenues.
 We cannot predict when, or to what extent, we will recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The longer the pandemic lasts, including repeat or cyclical outbreaks, the longer it will take for us to recover from the adverse effects, continuing to impact our business, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, financial condition, access to credit markets and ability to service our existing and future indebtedness.
 The outbreak of COVID-19 has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. For additional information on risks related to a slowdown or recession, inflationary, supply chain and wage pressures, see “—Other General Risks—General political, social, health and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.”
 To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, including but not limited to those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.
 Risks Related to Our Business and Operations
Our business depends on film production and performance.
Our business depends on both the availability of suitable films for exhibition in our theatres and the success of those films in our markets. Reduced volume of film releases, poor performance of films, the disruption in the

production of films due to events such as a strike by directors, writers or actors, a reduction in financing options for the film distributors, or a reduction in the production and marketing efforts of the film distributors to make and promote their films could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer patrons and reduced revenues. During 2020 and 2021, we saw a significant reduction in the quantity of films available to exhibit in our theatres. We expect the quantity of new film releases available for theatrical exhibition to continue to be lower than historical levels during 2022 as the industry rebounds from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, however studios may determine that certain types of films will not be released for theatrical exhibition and will go straight to streaming platforms, further impacting the quantity of films available.
Our results of operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis.
 Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres. The major film distributors generally release the films they anticipate will be most successful during the summer and holiday seasons. Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during these periods. The timing of releases, however, has become less pronounced as distributors have begun releasing content more evenly throughout the year. In our Latin American markets, while Hollywood content has similar release dates as in the U.S., the local holidays and seasons can vary. The unexpected emergence of a successful film during other periods or the failure of an expected success at a key time could alter this seasonality trend. Due to the dependency on the success of films released from one period to the next, results of operations for one period may not be indicative of the results for future periods.
 A deterioration in relationships with film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films.
 We rely on the film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres. The film distribution business is highly concentrated, with five major film distributors accounting for approximately 85.5% of U.S. box office revenues and 41 of the top 50 grossing films during 2021. Film distributors license films to exhibitors on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis. Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors. We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre. A deterioration in our relationship with any of the major film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
 We face intense competition for patrons and films which may adversely affect our business.
 The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive. We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors in many of our markets. We compete for both patrons and licensing of films. In markets where we do not face nearby competitive theatres, there is a risk of new theatres being built. The degree of competition for patrons is dependent upon such factors as location, theatre capacity, presentation quality, film showtime availability, customer service quality, products and amenities offered, and ticket prices. The principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include the theatre’s location and its demographics, the condition, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and licensing terms. We also face competition from new concept theatres such as dine-in theatres and tavern style theatres that open in close proximity to our conventional theatres. If we are unable to attract patrons or to license successful films, our business may be adversely affected.
 An increase in competing forms of entertainment or the use of alternative film distribution channels may reduce movie theatre attendance and limit revenue growth.
 We compete with other forms of out-of-home entertainment, such as family entertainment centers, concerts, theme parks, gaming and sporting events, for our patrons’ leisure time and disposable income. We also face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as streaming, digital downloads, video on-demand and network television. Some of these distribution channels have seen growth in production in recent years. A significant increase in popularity of these alternative film distribution channels, competing forms of entertainment or improvements in technologies available at home could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 Our results of operations may be impacted by the shrinking, or elimination of, video and digital release windows.
 The average video and digital release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film’s theatrical release to the date a film is available for DVD, was approximately 90 days and digital purchase for ownership (also known as electronic sell-through) was approximately 74 days for several years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, certain studios adopted strategies that reduced, or in some cases eliminated, the

release windows. Select studios released certain movie titles to their own streaming platforms either simultaneously with theatrical releases or bypassed theatrical releases altogether. Studios may continue to follow, or expand, these or similar strategies, leading to permanent changes that shorten or eliminate exclusive theatrical windows. If studios continue to reduce or eliminate the windows for certain films even after the industry recovers or, if our guests choose to wait for an in-home release rather than attend a theatre to view the film, it may continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Our foreign operations are subject to adverse regulations, economic instability and currency exchange risk.
 We have 201 theatres with 1,460 screens in fifteen countries in Latin America as of December 31, 2021. Brazil represented approximately 5% of our consolidated 2021 revenues. Governmental regulation of the motion picture industry in foreign markets differs from that in the U.S. Changes in regulations affecting prices and quota systems requiring the exhibition of locally-produced films may adversely affect our international operations. Our international operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by our domestic operations, including risks of severe economic downturns and high inflation. We also face risks of currency fluctuations, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange and cash payments to the U.S., all of which could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations.
We are subject to impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.
 We have a significant amount of long-lived assets. We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at the theatre level. Therefore, if a theatre is directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or condition of the areas surrounding the theatre, we may record impairment charges to reflect the decline in estimated fair value of that theatre.
We also have a significant amount of goodwill and tradename intangible assets. Declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions and/or countries or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any given region or country could result in impairments of goodwill and our intangible assets.
We are subject to uncertainties relating to future expansion plans, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or new theatre site locations, and to obtain financing for such activities on favorable terms or at all.
 We have greatly expanded our operations over the last decade through targeted worldwide theatre development and acquisitions. We continue to pursue a strategy of expansion that will involve the development of new theatres and may involve acquisitions of existing theatres and theatre circuits both in the U.S. and internationally. There is significant competition for new site locations and for existing theatre and theatre circuit acquisition opportunities. As a result of such competition, we may not be able to acquire attractive site locations, existing theatres or theatre circuits on terms we consider acceptable. The pace of our growth may also be impacted by delays in site development caused by other parties. Acquisitions and expansion opportunities may divert a significant amount of management’s time away from the operation of our business. Growth by acquisition also involves risks relating to difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies. Our expansion strategy may not result in improvements to our business, financial condition, profitability or cash flows. Further, our expansion programs may require financing above our existing borrowing capacity and operating cash flows. We may not be able to obtain such financing or ensure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
 Risks Related to Financing and Liquidity
We have substantial long-term lease and debt obligations, which may restrict our ability to fund current and future operations and that restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.
 We have, and will continue to have, significant long-term debt service obligations and long-term lease obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we had $2,543.3 million in long-term debt obligations, $117.2 million in finance lease obligations and $1,295.4 million in long-term operating lease obligations. Our substantial lease and debt obligations pose risk by:
 •requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to payments on our lease and debt obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate requirements and to pay dividends;


•impeding our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes;
 •subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our variable rate debt, including our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility;
 •limiting our ability to invest in innovations in technology and implement new platforms or concepts in our theatres; and
 •making us more vulnerable to adverse economic, market and industry conditions, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business operations or to our industry overall, and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors that have lower debt levels.
 Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows and on our future financial results. Our ability to generate positive cash flows is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. As we continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to generate cash flows at historical levels, or guarantee that future borrowings will be available under our senior secured credit facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our lease and debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and these actions may be restricted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our senior secured credit facility.
If we fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our leases and indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in them, we would be in default, and as a result, our debt holders would have the ability to require that we immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness and the lenders under our senior secured credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings. We could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt holders require immediate payment, we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
 A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned or a change in outlook to our outstanding debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.
 We are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies. The rating scales and methodologies used to derive individual ratings may vary from agency to agency. Credit ratings are issued by credit rating agencies based on evaluations of our ability to pay back our outstanding debt and the likelihood that we would default on that debt prior to its maturity. The credit ratings issued by the rating agencies represent the rating agency's evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative information for our company. The credit ratings that are issued are based on the rating agency’s judgment and experience in determining what information should be considered in giving a rating to a particular company. Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will continue for any given period of time.
Our debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered (or outlook thereof could be changed) or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business or industry, so warrant. Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. In particular, our access to the capital markets may be impacted, our other funding sources may decrease, the cost of debt may increase as a result of increased interest rates or fees, and we may be required to provide additional credit assurances, including collateral, under certain contracts or arrangements.
 Our inability to raise funds necessary to settle conversions of, or to repurchase, the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes (as defined below), upon a fundamental change as described in the indenture governing the 4.500%

Convertible Senior Notes, may lead to defaults under such indenture and under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness.
 If we settle the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes by cash, or by a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, upon a fundamental change as described in the indenture governing the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, we will be required to make cash payments with respect to the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes being surrendered or converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes is limited by the agreements governing our existing indebtedness (including the senior secured credit facility) and may also be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements that will govern our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes or to pay cash payable on future conversions of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture governing the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness (including the senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing Cinemark USA, Inc.’s senior notes).
The conditional conversion feature of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
 In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes is triggered, holders of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes will be entitled to convert the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, we may elect to satisfy our conversion obligations by payment and delivery of a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. Settlement of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.
 Conversion of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.
 The conversion of some or all of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon conversion of any of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes. The 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes may from time to time in the future be convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.
 The 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes Hedge Transactions and Warrant Transactions (each as defined below) may affect the value of our common stock.
 In connection with the pricing of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into Hedge Transactions with, and sold Warrants (as defined below) to, Option Counterparties (as defined below). The Hedge Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, as the case may be. The Warrants would separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of any Warrants on the applicable expiration dates unless, subject to the terms of the Warrants, we elect to cash settle the Warrants. In addition, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes or following any repurchase of the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes by us in connection with any fundamental change

repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or decrease in the market price of our common stock.
 In addition, if any such Hedge Transactions and Warrants fail to become effective, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may unwind their hedge positions with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.
 We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes Hedge Transactions.
 The Option Counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of such Option Counterparties may default under the Hedge Transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Option Counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any Option Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the Option Counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any Option Counterparty.
 A credit market crisis may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and may materially impact our operations.
 Severe dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the credit markets could materially impact our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all. The inability to access debt financing on reasonable terms could materially impact our ability to make acquisitions, invest in technology innovations or significantly expand our business in the future.
Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or otherwise restricted.
 Our ability to pay dividends is limited by our status as a holding company and the terms of our senior notes indentures and our senior secured credit facility, which restrict our ability to pay dividends and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, directly or indirectly, to us. Under our debt instruments, we may pay a cash dividend up to a specified amount, provided we have satisfied certain financial covenants in, and are not in default under, our debt instruments. The declaration of future dividends on our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, or Common Stock, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, limitations in our debt agreements and legal requirements. We suspended our dividend in March 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and it is uncertain when we will resume paying dividends.
 Future sales of our common stock may adversely affect the prevailing market price.
 Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market and the issuance of the shares reserved for future issuance under our incentive plan, in exchange for outstanding warrants, conversion of outstanding 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes, or in connection with acquisitions or other corporate events, will be dilutive to our existing stockholders and could result in a decrease in our stock price. We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our common stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by any of our large stockholders, our directors or executive officers of their shares of common stock. We can also issue shares of our common stock which are authorized but unissued and not reserved for any specific purpose without any action or approval by our stockholders.
We may not be able to generate additional revenues or continue to realize value from our investment in NCM.
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned 43,161,550 common units of NCM, which represented an ownership interest in NCM of approximately 26%. We receive monthly theatre access and advertising fees under our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM and we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company recorded approximately $45.8 million, $36.0 million and $44.1 million in other revenues related to NCM, respectively, $25.9 million, $14.2 million and $0.2 million in cash distributions recorded as a reduction of our investment in NCM, respectively, and $12.9 million, $7.0 million and $0.1 million in cash distributions in excess of our investment in NCM, respectively. Cinema advertising is a small component of the U.S. advertising market and therefore, NCM competes with larger, more established and well-known media platforms such as broadcast radio and television, cable and satellite television,

outdoor advertising and Internet portals. In-theatre advertising may not continue to attract advertisers or NCM’s in-theatre advertising format may not continue to be received favorably by theatre patrons. If NCM is unable to continue to generate consistent advertising revenues, its results of operations may be adversely affected and our investment in and distributions and revenues from NCM may be adversely impacted. NCM revenues and excess cash distributions have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since NCM's revenues are primarily dependent on theatre attendance, future NCM revenues and excess cash distributions from NCM to the Company will depend on the recovery of the motion picture exhibition industry. Excess cash distributions we have historically received are also restricted through December 2023 in accordance with the credit agreement amendment NCM recently entered into with its lenders.
Regulatory Risks
We are subject to various government regulations which could result in substantial costs.
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices in the U.S. and internationally. We must comply with laws regulating, among other things, antitrust activities, employment environment, sale of concession goods, alcoholic beverages, data protection and privacy and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") and similar state disability rights laws. Compliance with the ADA and similar disability rights laws requires us as a public accommodation to reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities. This applies to the construction of new theatres, certain renovations, existing theatres, websites and mobile applications and presentations for the blind, deaf and hard of hearing. Changes in existing laws, regulations or administrative practices or new laws, regulations or administrative practices could have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we must comply with state and local government restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 We may face data protection, data security, and privacy risks in connection with privacy regulation.
 Strict data privacy laws regulating the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data and consumers’ personally identifying information are evolving in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws impose compliance obligations for the collection, use, retention, security, processing, transfer and deletion of personally identifiable information of individuals and creates enhanced rights for individuals. These changes in the legal and regulatory environments in the areas of customer and employee privacy, data security, and cross-border data flows could have a material adverse effect on our business, primarily through the impairment of our marketing and transaction processing activities, the limitation on the types of information that we may collect, process and retain, the resulting costs of complying with such legal and regulatory requirements and potential monetary forfeitures and penalties for noncompliance
 We may be subject to increased labor and benefits costs.
 In the U.S., we are subject to United States federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions and overtime. We are also subject to union regulations in certain of our international markets, which can specify wage rates as well as minimum hours to be paid to certain employees. As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Labor market conditions have recently driven increases in wages across our labor base and similar increases may continue in the future. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs. This in turn could lead us to increase prices, which could impact our sales. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.
 Provisions in our corporate documents and certain agreements, as well as Delaware law, may hinder a change of control.
 Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us. These provisions include:
 •authorization of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval;
 •a board of directors classified into three classes of directors with the directors of each class having staggered, three-year terms;
 •provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders; and


•provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations and provide that directors serving on classified boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.
 Certain provisions of our 8.750% secured notes indenture, 5.250% senior notes indenture, our 5.875% senior notes indenture and our senior secured credit facility may have the effect of delaying or preventing future transactions involving a “change of control.” A “change of control” would require us to make an offer to the holders of each of our 8.750% Secured Notes, 5.250% Senior Notes and our 5.875% Senior Notes (each as defined below) to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. A “change of control” would also be an event of default under our senior secured credit facility.
 Risks Related to Information Security and Business Disruptions
 An information security incident, including a cyber security breach, and our failure to protect our electronically stored data could adversely affect our business or reputation.
We collect, use, store and maintain electronic information and data necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information of the company, our customers, and our employees. We also rely on the availability of information technology systems to operate our business, including for communications, receiving and displaying movies, ticketing, guest services, payments, and other general operations. We rely on some of our vendors to store and process certain data and to manage, host, and/or provide some of our information technology systems. Because of the scope and complexity of our information technology systems, our reliance on vendors to provide, support and protect our systems and data, and the constantly evolving cyber-threat landscape, our information technology systems are subject to the risk of disruption, failure, unauthorized access, cyber-terrorism, human error, misuse, tampering, theft, and other cyber-attacks. These or similar events, whether accidental or intentional, could result in theft, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data, which could harm our reputation or result in a loss of business, as well as remedial and other costs, fines, investigations, enforcement actions or lawsuits. These or similar events could also lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems resulting in business impact, including loss of business. Those same scope, complexity, reliance, and changing cyber-threat landscape factors could also affect our ability to adapt to and comply with changing regulations and contractual obligations applicable to data security and privacy, which are increasingly demanding, both in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we operate. In order to address these risks, we have adopted security measures and technology, operate a security program, and work continuously to evaluate and improve our security posture. However, the development and maintenance of these systems and programs are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. As such, there can be no assurance that these or similar events will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.
In addition to Company-specific cyber threats or events, our business and results of operations could also be impacted by cyber-related events affecting our peers and partners within the entertainment industry, as well as other retail companies. We maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for cyber risks related to what we believe to be adequate and collectible insurance in the event of the theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data, but the foregoing events or future events could result in costs and business impacts which may not be covered or may be in excess of any available insurance that we may have procured. As a result, future events could have a material impact on our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Other General Risks
 General political, social, health and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.
 Our results of operations are dependent on general political, social, health and economic conditions, and the impact of such conditions on our theatre operating costs and on the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres. If consumers’ discretionary income declines during a period of an economic downturn or political uncertainty, our operations could be adversely affected. If theatre operating costs, such as utility costs, increase due to political or economic changes, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Supply chain interruptions may increase costs and limit product availability, as reduced supply of certain commodities and labor shortages in the transportation industry have led to limitations in product availability and continued increases in product pricing. Political events, such as terrorist attacks, and health-related pandemics or epidemics, such as flu or other virus outbreaks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, could impact our ability to operate certain of our theatres, which could adversely affect our results of operations.


A failure to adapt to future technological innovations could impact our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our results of operations.
 While we continue to invest in technological innovations, such as laser projectors, motion seats and satellite distribution technologies, new technological innovations continue to impact our industry. If we are unable to respond to or invest in changes in technology and the technological preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
 Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business.
 Recently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as-yet unspecified array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the U.S. to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company. Also, compliance of our theatres and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business. However, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.
 We may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations.
 We own and operate a large number of theatres and other properties within the U.S. and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health. Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials. We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal. Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.
 Product recalls and associated costs could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.
 We may be found liable if the consumption of any of the products we sell causes illness or injury. We are also subject to recall by product manufacturers or if the food products become contaminated. Recalls could result in losses due to the cost of the recall, the destruction of the product and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time.
