ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Reference herein to the “Company,” “PME,” “we,” “our” or “us,” means Pingtan Marine Enterprise Ltd and includes its subsidiaries, unless the contest requires otherwise.
 
Our Business
 
We are a marine enterprise group primarily engaging in ocean fishing through our operating subsidiary, Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd., or Pingtan Fishing, which is organized in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). We harvest a variety of fish species with many of our owned vessels or licensed vessels for which we have exclusive operating license rights. These vessels are located within the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”), the Arafura Sea of Indonesia, the international waters of Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the international waters of Indian Ocean. We provide high quality seafood to a diverse group of customers including distributors, restaurant owners and exporters in the PRC. 
 
In June 2013, we expanded our fleet from 40 to 86 vessels through a purchase of 46 fishing trawlers. We began operating these vessels in the third quarter of 2013 and have been entitled to net profits from their operation. Each vessel carries a crew of 10 to 15 persons. These vessels have resulted in additional carrying capacity of approximately 45,000 to 50,000 tons of fish.
 
In September 2013, we further increased our fleet to 106 vessels with the acquisition of 20 newly-built fishing trawlers. These vessels have a run-in period of 3 - 6 months, during which each is placed into the sea for testing prior to full operation. At full operation, each vessel is capable of harvesting 900 to 1,000 tons of fish. 
 
Subsequent to our fleet expansions, in September 2013, the Bureau of Fisheries of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People’s Republic of China (“MOA”) issued a notification that it would suspend accepting shipbuilding applications for tuna harvesting vessels, squid harvesting vessels, Pacific saury harvesting vessels, trawlers operating on international waters, seine on international waters, and trawlers operating on the Arafura Sea, Indonesia. We believe the announcement is a positive indicator for long-term stability and balance in China’s fishing industry. 
 
On December 4, 2013, in connection with the sale of China Dredging Group Co., Ltd (“CDGC” or “China Dredging”) to Fuzhou Honglong Ocean Fishery Co., Ltd (“Hong Long”), an affiliate company majority owned by a close family member of the Company’s CEO, we acquired 20-year operating license rights in connection with the lease of 20 fishing drifters for the appraised fair market value of approximately $216.1 million, whereby we are entitled to 100% of the operations and net profits (losses) from the vessels for the term of the lease. 
 
In September 2014, we further expanded our fleet to 129 vessels with the addition of 3 newly-built light luring seine vessels. At full operation, each vessel is capable of harvesting 2,000 tons of fish.
 
In June 2015, we purchased 4 longline fishing vessels and 2 squid jigging vessels for the appraised fair market value of approximately $56.2 million from Hong Long and Fuzhou Yishun Deep-Sea Fishing Co., Ltd. (“Yishun”), which is an affiliate company majority owned by an immediate family member of the Company’s CEO. These vessels are primarily focused on catching tuna and squid.
 
In March 2017, we purchased from Hong Long 1 refrigerated transport vessel and 4 squid jigging vessels for the appraised fair market value of approximately $38.5 million. Of those vessels, 2 finished renovation in October 2017, the Company obtained the ownership certificates of those 2 vessels and deployed them to international waters. At present, the Company has not obtained the ownership of the remaining 3 vessels but is entitled to 100% of the operations and net profits (losses) from the vessels.
 
In October 2016, we deployed 13 vessels, which were granted fishing licenses by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (“MAF”), to operate in the Indo-Pacific waters of the country. These fishing licenses were valid for one year. The vessels were purchased from Hong Long in June 2013. In September 2017, we were informed that the fishing licenses of the 13 vessels were suspended and the vessels were docked in the port by the MAF. The MAF alleged and investigated whether false statements were made during the licensing process and the vessels were simultaneously registered in Indonesia. We disputed these allegations and the government of Timor-Leste eventually agreed to release these vessels as no evidence was presented to support such allegations. The 13 vessels have returned to China for regular maintenance. 
 
In December 2017, we deployed 2 squid jigging vessels to the international waters of the South-West Atlantic Ocean.
 
On April 2, 2018, 27 vessels received approval from the MOA to operate in the international waters of the Indian Ocean. After the modification and rebuilding project, 19 of the 27 new fishing vessels have been deployed to sea in November and December 2018, and the remaining 8 new fishing vessels will be gradually placed into the international waters of the Indian Ocean.
 
In October 2018, we purchased 1 refrigerated transport vessel, which started the modification and rebuilding project. We expect the modification and rebuilding project to be completed in June 2019, and the transport vessel will be deployed to international waters of the Indian Ocean in support of the 27 new fishing vessels.

As of December 31, 2018, we own 66 trawlers, 18 squid jigging vessels, 13 drifters, 10 light luring seine vessels and 4 longline fishing vessels, have exclusive operating license rights to 20 drifters, and we also have 8 squid jigging vessels and 2 transport vessels which are in the modification and rebuilding project. The 8 squid vessels completed the modification and rebuilding project and are deployed to the international waters of the Indian Ocean in March 2019. We are the second largest China-based fishery company operating its vessels outside of China waters and our fleet has an average remaining useful life of approximately 14.6 years. All of our vessels are approved by the MOA and, to the extent required, licensed by foreign fishing territories where they operate, subject to any foreign government’s moratorium or any suspensions or revocations that apply to the vessels or local entities, as described below. 
 
Among the 141 vessels, 12 are located in the Bay of Bengal in India; 29 are located in international waters; and 13 have returned to China from the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste due to the reason described above; and 10 vessels are in the modification and rebuilding project. The remaining 77 vessels were licensed by the MOA to operate in the Arafura Sea in Indonesia. The vessels in Indonesian waters, however, are not in operation because the licenses are currently inactive due to either the moratorium discussed below, the revocation of the fishery business license of the local entity through which the vessels operate, or, with respect to 4 vessels, the revocation of the local fishing licenses.
 
We catch nearly 50 different species of fish including ribbon fish, croaker fish, Peru squid, Argentina squid, sailfish and chub mackerel. All of our catch is shipped back to China. We arrange chartered transportation ships to deliver frozen stocks to cold storage warehouses located in one of China’s largest seafood trading centers, Mawei Seafood Market in Fujian Province. 
  
We derive our revenue primarily from the sale of frozen seafood products. We sell our products directly to customers including distributors, restaurant owners and exporters. Most of our customers have long-term, cooperative relationships with us. Our existing customers also introduce new customers to us from time to time. In July 2017, we entered into an exclusive strategic cooperation agreement to sell our fish products directly to consumers online. Our operating results are subject to seasonal variations. Harvest volume is the highest in the fourth quarter of the year while harvest volumes in the second and third quarters are relatively low due to the spawn season of certain fish species, including ribbon fish, cuttlefish, pomfret, and squid. Based on past experiences, demand for seafood products is the highest from December to January, during Chinese New Year. We believe that our profitability and growth are dependent on the termination of the Indonesian moratorium discussed below or the redeployment of our vessels from Indonesian waters to other locations, our ability, and those with which we conduct business, to maintain effective licenses with local departments of fisheries, such as Indonesia and Timor-Leste, and our ability to expand our customer base. 
 
Government Permits and Approvals
 
We are required to go through a series of procedures to obtain all approvals necessary to fish in the designated fishing areas.
 
Step one: Obtaining Vessel Building Permits
 
First, we have to file a vessel building application to the relevant governmental authorities in Fujian to obtain the Fishing Vessel and Net Tools Building Permits. Governmental authorities in Fujian verify Pingtan Fishing’s qualifications for pelagic fishing and pass on the verified and approved application documents to affiliates of the Ministry of Agriculture for further confirmation. Once confirmed, the certificates are issued to Pingtan Fishing.
Step two: Vessels Building and Inspection
 
After obtaining the Fishing Vessel and Net Tools Building Permits, we start building the new vessels through contracting with third party vessel manufacturers. During the period of construction, inspection of the vessels is performed several times by the relevant governmental authorities. Once the construction is completed, a Vessel Inspection Certificate is issued, after which we can apply for certificates of ownership and certificates of nationality for new vessels.
Step three: Fishing Project Application
 
Each vessel is required to be licensed by the MOA and, to the extent required, the vessel may also be required to obtain a license from the local government where the vessel conducts fishing operations. For example, in order to conduct fishing operations in the Exclusive Economic Zone of other countries, foreign fishing vessels need to obtain the approval from each of the local Departments of Fisheries of those other countries. After obtaining all certificates in step two, we file applications to the relevant governmental authorities to obtain approvals for pelagic fishing projects in the specified fishing areas. Meanwhile, we start the application process for obtaining fishing permits from the relevant governmental authorities in the applicable fishing destination countries. In some countries, the Company may be required to obtain licenses through local entities, which are required to also possess a fishery business license. For example, in Indonesia, the Company conducts its fishing operations through PT. Avona Mina Lestari (“PT Avona”) and PT. Dwikarya Reksa Abadi (“PT Dwikarya”), which are locally-owned entities. Immediate family of Xinrong Zhuo, our Chairman and CEO, manage or have an ownership interest in PT. Avona and PT Dwikarya.
Step four: Preparations Before Departure
 
Once the approval for pelagic fishing projects is issued, we can complete all relevant departure procedures within six months from the time the notification of approval is issued. Departure procedures include obtaining visas for fishing vessels and crew members, submitting required certificates to the PRC customs in Fujian, and obtaining other relevant documents from governmental authorities, such as Vessel Departure Certificates.

Step five: Fishing Project Approval and Departure to Fishing Areas
 
After we have submitted all required documents to the relevant governmental authorities and completed all procedures required for departure, we receive confirmation of pelagic fishing project approval from affiliates of the Ministry of Agriculture. Once we obtain such confirmation, our vessels can departure to the applicable fishing destination country. Fish caught at the destination may then be shipped back and be declared at the PRC customs.
 
In early December 2014, the Indonesian government introduced a six-month moratorium on issuing new fishing licenses and renewals so that the country’s Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (“MMAF”) could combat illegal fishing and rectify ocean fishing order. In February 2015, we ceased all fishing operations in Indonesia. During the moratorium, we were informed that fishing licenses of four vessels operated through PT Avona, one of the local companies through which we conduct business in Indonesia, and the fishery business license of PT Dwikarya, the other local company through which we conduct business in Indonesia, were revoked. As a result and because license renewal was prohibited due to the general moratorium, all local fishing licenses of the Company’s vessels in Indonesia are presently inactive. The MMAF has not yet restored license issuing or renewal process for vessels built abroad. As the MMAF has not implemented new fishing policies and resumed the license renewal process, we do not know when exactly licensing and renewal will start. We have been paying close attention to any new trends in fishing policy and have been actively exploring new locations to deploy our vessels, such as EEZ of Southeast Asian countries. Since we derived a majority of our revenue from this area, this ban has caused a significant drop in our production.
 
In September 2017, we were informed that the fishing licenses of the 13 vessels were suspended and the vessels were docked in the port by the MAF Timor-Leste. The MAF alleged and investigated whether false statements were made during the licensing process and the vessels were simultaneously registered in Indonesia. We disputed these allegations and the government of Timor-Leste eventually agreed to release these vessels as no evidence was presented to support such allegations. The 13 vessels have returned to China for regular maintenance. 
 
Operations
 
Harvesting Operations
 
The fishing vessels can carry up to one-month of supplies. The captains of the vessels utilize sophisticated technology to identify, among other things, fishing areas, time to cast and draw in the nets, vessel speed and sailing direction allowing the vessels to optimize the catch and resource value. Nearby fishing groups share real-time fishing information through wireless radio equipment. The catch is separated based on species and sizes, and is frozen immediately.
 
Once the storage of a fishing vessel is at capacity, the catch would be shipped to our cold storage located in Mawei. The vessels return to the fishing base and transfer the catch to transportation vessels docked at the fishing base port. We have entered into a contract with PT. Avona, which operates a fishing base owned or managed by immediate family of Mr. Xinrong Zhuo, our founder and chairman, to obtain access to the base and secure certain services including custom declaration and fishing permits registrations. We also use the fishing base to repair our vessels, if necessary.
 
Transportation
 
Transportation vessels are responsible for the shipment of fishing supplies and fish between the fishing areas and China. Pingtan Fishing ships its goods by contracting with two affiliate marine transportation firms, four third party transportation firms and one transportation vessel owned by the Company. The transportation cycle typically takes no more than 30 days, depending mainly on the fishing seasons.
Seasonality
 
In most waters where our vessels operate, autumn and winter are the seasons when harvest is most productive and summer is relatively a low season. In addition, our annual catches are affected by a number of unpredictable factors, such as weather patterns and fish migration, which are likely to vary from year to year.
Cold Storage
 
Fish are stored separately according to different species and sizes for best practices of cold storage management, goods selectivity and delivery. When Pingtan Fishing unloads the fish, it places the fish on a wood pallet according to fishing vessel number, species and size. The cold storage administrator counts the number of bags on each pallet and weighs each pallet to record the weight. Pallets with bags of fish are then placed in specified positions within the cold storage facilities.

We have secured several cold storages located in one of China’s largest seafood trading center, MaWei seafood market. The monthly rent for Fuxin cold storage is RMB70 (US$10) per square meter and the leases are renewable annually. The following table sets forth information regarding the cold storages we currently rent as of December 31, 2018:
 

 | Monthly | 
-------------+------------+-------
Cold Storage | rent (US$) | 
Fuxin#201 | $ | 11,054
Fuxin#203 | | 11,054
Fuxin#502 | | 7,585 
Xinjinxin | | 2,873 
Hengchang | | 4,335 
Total | $ | 36,901

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We market, sell and distribute products all over China, including the Fujian, Guangdong and Shandong provinces. Ribbon fish, croaker fish and squid were the main types of seafood sold for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing 62.5% of the sales.
 
We have established long-term relationships with a number of customers, who send purchasing representatives to our cold storage facilities to select goods to purchase. The customer indicates the type, size and quantity as well as price and delivery schedules before the fish is moved into our cold storage facilities. Handling and transportation fees are borne by the customer when the goods are delivered. The proportion of these sales depends on the season and the nature of the catch including species, size and quality. During 2018, we entered into an arrangement to sell our fish products directly to consumers online. Remaining products are sold out of cold storage within three months of landing.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we sold our fish to over 80 distributors and retailers by acting as a wholesaler. We serve a wide customer base and three customers accounted for more than 10% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Vessels
 
As of December 31, 2018, we own 66 trawlers, 18 squid jigging vessels, 13 drifters, 10 light luring seine vessels and 4 longline fishing vessels, have exclusive operating license rights to 20 drifters, and we also have 8 squid jigging vessels and 2 transport vessels which are in the modification and rebuilding project. The 8 squid vessels completed the modification and rebuilding project and are deployed to the international waters of the Indian Ocean in March 2019. We are the second largest China-based fishery company operating its vessels outside of China waters and our fleet has an average remaining useful life of approximately 14.6 years.
 
Among the 141 vessels, 12 are located in the Bay of Bengal in India; 29 are located in international waters; and 13 have returned to China from the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste due to the reason described above; and 10 vessels are in the modification and rebuilding project. The remaining 77 vessels were licensed by the MOA to operate in the Arafura Sea in Indonesia. The vessels in Indonesian waters, however, are not in operation because the licenses are currently inactive due to either the moratorium discussed below, the revocation of the fishery business license of the local entity through which the vessels operate, or, with respect to 4 vessels, the revocation of the local fishing licenses.
 
Single trawling vessels drag pocket-shaped nets and therefore force the fish into the nets. The trawl net on a trawling vessel is drawn by a winch on the deck of the vessel. Fish are sorted and stored in the cold storage on board the vessel. Single trawling vessels can catch species living in the upper layer of water. It has the advantage of catching multiple species of fish, which leads to a varied catch. Single trawling vessels are the majority of fishing vessels we currently use. As of December 31, 2018, we own 66 trawling vessels. 12 of the trawling vessels are currently operating in Indian waters.
 
Drifter vessels, as known as drifter netter vessels, have a gill net that is tied to the drift netter floats with weights attached to the net to keep it vertical, so that fish crossing the path of a drift net gets caught in it. Operations are generally carried out at night and the position of gill nets can be adjusted according to the water depth in which the fish move at any time. Drifter netter vessels are mainly used to catch dispersed fish or fish swimming in the upper layer of water. We own 13 drifters and had operating license rights to 20 drifters as of December 31, 2018.
 
Squid jigging vessels have overhead lights which illuminate the water and attract squid, which then gather in the shaded area under the boat. The squid are caught using barbless lures on monofilament fishing lines which are jigged up and down in the water by machines. We own 18 squid jigging vessels in operation and 8 squid jigging vessels in the modification and rebuilding project as of December 31, 2018.
 
Longline fishing vessel is the type of vessel which uses a long line, called the main line, with baited hooks attached at intervals by means of branch lines called snoods (or ganglions). Hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks can hang from a single line to catch fish species. We own 4 longline fishing vessels as of December 31, 2018.
 
Light luring seine is a method of fishing that employs lights to lure fish into a fishing net called “seine” that hangs vertically in the water with its bottom edge held down by weights and its top edge buoyed by floats. We own 10 light luring seine vessels as of December 31, 2018.
 
Business Strategy
 
We are committed to developing our business to become a global, integrated seafood company. We plan to enlarge our fishing fleet in the next few years through organic growth and acquisition opportunities of potential targets, domestically and abroad.

We are actively seeking opportunities to expand to other fishing grounds worldwide including North America, South America and the High Sea, which will further diversify the fish types we harvest as well as decrease our dependence on Indonesia. We are also planning to extend to fish processing business. If we operate fish processing plants, our goal is to market processed food products throughout China and in international markets while achieving forward integration of the industrial chain.
 
Based on the continuing moratorium in Indonesia, we have been seeking opportunities to deploy the vessels located in Indonesian waters to new fishing locations. In November 2018, we submitted to the MOA an application for the deployment of 24 fishing vessels to international waters to conduct fishing operations. As of December 31, 2018, the final documented approval was not received.
 
Competition
 
We engage in the fishing business in the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone, the international waters of Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the international waters of Indian Ocean and the Arafura Sea of Indonesia. We believe that competition within our designated fishing areas is not significant, as we believe the region is not currently overfished.
 
Competition in the consumer market in China is high as fish compete with other sources of protein. We compete with other fishing companies which offer similar and varied products. There is significant demand for fish in the Chinese market. Our catch appeals to a wide segment of consumers because of the low-price points of our products. We have generally been able to sell our catch at market prices.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 876 employees. The following table sets forth the number of employees by function as of December 31, 2018:
 

 | Number of Employees | | % of Total
------------------------------------+---------------------+-----+-----------
Management and administrative staff | | 60 | | 6.8 | %
Crew members | | 816 | | 93.2 | %
Total | | 876 | | 100.0 | %

 
In 2018, we engaged with three third party labor companies to provide crew members service, we pay the hiring costs based on the actual fees incurred on monthly basis. Welfare and benefit payments for such personnel are covered by the company supplying the crew members.
 
Company History
 
China Equity Growth Investment Ltd. (“CGEI”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted limited liability company, was incorporated as a blank check company on January 18, 2010 with the purpose of directly or indirectly acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination, an operating business, or control of such operating business through contractual arrangements, that has its principal business and/or material operations located in the PRC. In connection with its initial business combination, CGEI changed its name to Pingtan Marine Enterprise Ltd. in February 2013.
 
China Dredging Group Co., Ltd (“CDGC” or “China Dredging”) and Merchant Supreme Co., Ltd (“Merchant Supreme”) are limited liability companies incorporated on April 14, 2010 and June 25, 2012, respectively, in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”).
 
China Dredging, through its PRC Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”), Fujian Xinggang Port Service Co., Ltd (“Fujian Service”), provided specialized dredging services exclusively to the PRC marine infrastructure market and is, based on the number and capacity of the dredging vessels it operates, one of the leading independent (not state-owned) providers of such services in the PRC. Since its inception, China Dredging has functioned exclusively as a specialist subcontractor, performing dredging services for other companies licensed to function as general contractors. China Dredging engages in capital dredging (dredging carried out to create a new harbor, berth or waterway or to deepen existing facilities in order to allow larger ships access), maintenance dredging and reclamation dredging projects and primarily sources its projects by subcontracting projects from general contractors.
 
Merchant Supreme, through its PRC VIE, Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd. (“Pingtan Fishing”) engages in ocean fishery with its fleet of self- owned vessels and vessels with exclusive operating license rights within Indian EEZ and Arafura Sea of Indonesia. Pingtan Fishing is ranked highly as one of the leading private (not state-owned) supplier and trader of oceanic aquatic products in PRC.
 
CGEI and CDGC entered into the Merger Agreement dated October 24, 2012, providing for the combination of CGEI and CDGC. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CDGC would continue as the surviving company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGEI. CGEI also acquired all of the outstanding capital shares and other equity interests of Merchant Supreme as per Share Purchase Agreement dated October 24, 2012. Following the completion of the business combination on February 25, 2013, CDGC and Merchant Supreme became the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “Business Combination”). The ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share were listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “PME”. The merger among CGEI, CDGC and Merchant Supreme has been accounted for as a “reverse merger”. CDGC and Merchant Supreme jointly are deemed the accounting acquirer and consequently, the transaction is treated as recapitalization of CDGC and Merchant Supreme.

On June 19, 2013, the Company entered into a master agreement (“Master Agreement”) with a related party, Hong Long, to acquire 46 fishing vessels with total consideration of $410.1 million. The major shareholder of Hong Long is Fujian Yihai Investment Co., Ltd., which is controlled by Longjie Zhuo, Xinrong Zhuo’s brother. Xinrong Zhuo currently holds about 57.4% of PME. On September 1, 2013, the Company further entered into a Memorandum with Hong Long to clarify the procedure of delivery of such 46 vessels to Pingtan Fishing. Due to additional time required to prepare the vessels for operations, the parties agreed under the Memorandum to deliver the vessels for operation on September 1, 2013. Since June 2013, the Company has had the full right to operate the vessels and is in the process of registering the vessels under the name of the Company’s PRC operating company. Currently, 33 of the 46 vessels are formally registered to the Company. The vessels are in the process of being registered under the name of the Company’s PRC operating company and it will obtain the entire title registration document for the vessels, as required by Chinese laws and regulations according to the terms of the Master Agreement.
 
In order to place increased focus on fishing business and pursue more effective growth opportunities, we decided to exit and sell the specialized dredging services operated by China Dredging, and we completed the sale of CDGC and its subsidiaries on December 4, 2013.
 
On February 9, 2015, we terminated our existing VIE agreements, pursuant to an Agreement of Termination dated February 9, 2015, entered into by and among Ms. Honghong Zhuo, Mr. Zhiyan Lin (each a shareholder of Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd (“Pingtan Fishing”), together the “Pingtan Fishing’s Shareholders”), Pingtan Fishing and Pingtan Guansheng Ocean Fishing Co., Ltd. (“Pingtan Guansheng”). On February 9, 2015, the Pingtan Fishing’s Shareholders transferred 100% of their equity interest in Pingtan Fishing to Fujian Heyue Marine Fishing Development Co., Ltd. (“Fujian Heyue”), pursuant to an Equity Transfer Agreement dated February 9, 2015, entered into by and among the Pingtan Fishing’s Shareholders, Pingtan Fishing and Fujian Heyue. On February 15, 2015, China Agriculture Industry Development Fund Co., Ltd. (“China Agriculture”) invested RMB 400 million (approximately $65 million) into Pingtan Fishing for an 8% equity interest in Pingtan Fishing. After the restructuring transactions described above, Pingtan Fishing and its entities became the 92% equity-owned subsidiaries of our company and our VIE structure was terminated.
