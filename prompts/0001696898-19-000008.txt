OUR PRODUCTS

Brief History of Our Products

3D printing is a tremendously exciting new technology that is changing the face of modern manufacturing. The transformative impact of this technology on the way we produce things is only likely to increase as it continues developing. The 3D printing has become considerably more visible in recent years, as 3D printing companies pop up in more communities, and 3D printed products become more popular. While it may seem like the 3D printing has only recently exploded onto the scene, the technology has actually been

around for three decades. After the first 3D printing patent was awarded to Hideo Kodama in Japan. Kodama had invented a device which used a UV light to harden photo reactive polymers. The idea was that the technology would be useful for creating models and prototypes. Since then, additive manufacturing technologies have been used for rapid prototyping, where it has significantly improved the speed of the product development process.

A few years later, a team of French inventors applied in France for the first patents on the stereo lithography method, which is still widely used today. Stereo lithography is much like Kodamas invention, relying on UV light to harden photopolymers. Remarkably, the French General Electric abandoned their patent application, and so neve resulted in a patent. While Kodama had actually invented this system some time before Hull came up with his machine and coined the term still used to describe it, he did make another important and unique contribution to the history of 3D printing. Hull would file his patent for a stereo lithography machine. Hulls application was not to be abandoned, however. Hull named the process stereo lithography, which remains one of the most common 3D printing techniques today. Carl Deckard filed a patent for Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). The laser sintering process has developed to become the most popular 3D printing technologies, used across a wide range of industries, for models and for end-use parts.

Today, desktop 3D printers are cheaper and better than ever and continuing to improve. While there is a dedicated core group of enthusiasts who benefit from having a machine in their homes, most of the desktop units are actually used in schools and businesses. Besides, the quality achievable by the commercial units is still far above what the more modest consumer-grade printers can produce. For most individuals, 3D printing services are the best way to take advantage of the ever-growing potential of additive manufacturing. Buyers can get access to top-of-the-line printers and materials for the projects they need, without having to invest in buying a machine themselves.

Current Market

The market share concentration in the global 3D manufacturing industry increased in recent years because of the demand in the market of manufacturing and services. 3D Printing can be used in all spheres of human activity without exception. This versatile production that allows going beyond the capabilities of a single industry. 

The structure of the whole production is divided into small steps that include: preparation of the necessary materials to create products, build up a model of certain goods using special programs, followed by a stage of the creation of the product and its handling after printing. Additionally, 3D printing is a future of the whole industries, as companies that operate in developed economies outsource 3D products from emerging economies, such as China, to reduce costs. In the nearest future the demand on 3D printer machines and 3D goods will increase in the entire world.

There are many well-established 3D companies in our industry. We hope to offer the latest 3D products to our customers, at the lowest price, so we can succeed in the business. We believe we can offer our customers the best possible prices for the similar or better quality products than other companies in same business area.

We have entered into a supply agreement with Yueqing Swai Electronic Co., Ltd. of China. Until such time as we accept deliver of 3D products, all risk of loss of the 3D equipment and materials shall be on the supplying seller. 

MARKETING

Our sole officer and director, Zhang Shufang, will be responsible for marketing of our services. The marketing and advertising will be targeted to small businesses, building company, advertising agencies, home owners and various sectors which have need of 3D products and 3D models. To advertise our business, we plan to contact the marketing companies that will provide services to us to spread our name to the masses. In addition, we will place our own ads on Internet open spaces and create accounts in social networks. We plan to develop a website to market, display and sell our products. Also we will ask our satisfied clients for referrals.

We believe that the best way to market our products is through magazines, banner advertising, Internet advertising on websites, and through our website (www.corpchee.com), and various social networking sites. We believe that we can establish relationships with 3D product distributors in China and in countries all over the world through these mediums of communication.

COMPETITION

There are many well-established 3D manufacturing companies in our industry like Qingdao Unique Products Develop Co., Ltd., Henan Speed Electric Technology Co., Ltd., Zhongshan Capstar Power Technology Co., Limited, and Dongguan Farwise Technology Co., Ltd. We expect to face medium to high level of resistance when we enter the market, where it will be up to our marketing efforts and negotiation skills to acquire new customers. Most of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and will be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we are. We also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants. We

may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

STARTUP EQUIPMENT

We are startup developing company. We believe that the 3D printer business will be successful in the market, as the 3D-printer can print products for different spheres of consumers. The 3D-printer optimally created for small businesses. To start the conduct of our business, we purchase printer (Ultimaker two plus). As of the day of this filing we bought the second 3D printed machine Ultimaker two plus and put it into production. This is due to the fact that 3D printing machine spends a lot of time on one units of product.

For starting 3D business, we are going to expand materials we use and develop our creativeness in 3d business. There are 3(three) kinds of materials that we are going to use firstly:

ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) and PLA (polylactic acid) - are great starter materials: affordable, durable and widely available. They`re available in all colors, and well-suited for prototyping mechanical parts and designs that don`t have a lot of overhangs.

Printing with general purpose plastics come with some design restrictions. Models with an outward facing wall angle sharper than 45 degrees can`t be printed without extra support material and parts under 1 mm will most likely not print.

Ideal for:
 -Low-cost prototyping 
 -Mechanical parts
 -Cases, holders, adapters 
 -Games, toys
 -Scale models

Not recommended for:
-Intriate designs

SLS Nylon - its the perfect all-rounder: easy design rules, strong and slightly flexible. Nylon allows for functional end products and complex designs. Its surface is a bit grainy, but it can be polished for a smooth finish.

Nylon prints are laser sintered on industrial 3D printers. The technology gives you a high degree of form freedom and you can even print moving parts in one go.

Ideal for:
 -Functional prototypes and end products
 -Complex designs with intricate details
 -Moving and assembled parts
 -Cases, holders, adapters 

Not recommended for:
 -Cavities within design (unless making use of escape holes)

For the first time we are going to buy 5 coils of the lead material (PLA and ABS) and one extra spool of ABS, that we are ready to put into production of the exhibition samples of our products. As auxiliary material we are going to use Nylon (three coils) for extra cases and our more advanced features. Our customers will be able to independently create a suitable model for 3D printing, which we will manufacture later on 3D machine, or else our company itself can provide or create models for individual orders. As a complement to our overall operations, we plan to use 3D pen and then buy a 3D scan to improve the quality and accuracy of finished products.

We believe that this is enough to start operation, further more we will buy additional portion of the equipment.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES

We have not incurred any research expenditures since our incorporation.

BANKRUPTCY OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS

There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.

REORGANIZATIONS, PURCHASE OR SALE OF ASSETS

There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
