On April 3, 2003, the Company acquired Proyecciones y Ventas Organizadas, S.A. de C.V. (“Provo Mexico”) and in December 2003 the Company changed the name to Provo International Inc. (“Provo”).
 
In 2008, Provo changed its name to Ebenefits Direct, Inc., which, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, L.A. Marketing Plans, LLC, engaged in the business of direct response marketing.

Agritek Holdings Inc. has organized its interests across three business units – Agritek Venture Holdings; The American Hemp Trading Company; and MediSwipe, Inc. Agritek Venture Holdings includes the Company’s real estate portfolio, controlled equity holdings, minority equity holdings and royalty interests in real estate or licensed operations. Subsidiary operations also include a portfolio of wholly owned and licensed brands that cover high growth segments of the cannabis sector including vaping, pre-rolls, edibles, topicals, medical devices, concentrates and animal health under its American Hemp Trading Company brand and Colorado industrial hemp license. MediSwipe, Inc. offers a suite of services including corporate finance, marketing & branding, operational support, financial management, and compliance & regulatory services. These services are offered by a strong in-house team complemented by independent advisors with the objective of assisting clients and partners in accelerating the commercialization of their product(s) or services, and ultimately in leveraging their unique selling proposition to create a leadership position in their chosen niche within the global cannabis industry.
 
Recent Developments
 
Currently, we are exploring strategic alternatives for certain operational and non-operational assets in both Colorado and California. We are confident we can get a better return on our invested capital by redeploying assets. We’re working with financial advisors to identify locations or permits that can generate non-dilutive capital that can be reinvested in strategic locations to produce greater returns. We have identified multiple opportunities that appear to be a more accretive use of capital. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our exploration of strategic alternatives and there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful.
 
On March 26, 2019, we implemented a 1-for-200 reverse stock split of our common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split became effective in the stock market upon commencement of trading on March 26, 2018. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every two-hundred shares of our Pre-Reverse Stock Split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and any fractional shares were rounded up to the nearest whole share. The number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities were also reduced by a factor of two-hundred as of March 26, 2019. All historical share and per share amounts reflected throughout this report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The authorized number of shares and the par value per share of our common stock were not affected by the Reverse Stock Split.
 
We have a “rollup” growth strategy, which includes the following components:
 

• | With our brand recognition and experienced management team, maximize productivity, provide economies of scale, and increase profitability through our public market vehicle; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Acquire unique products and niche players where barriers to entry are high and margins are robust, providing them clients a broader outlet for their products; and 
• | Acquire multiple production facilities to capture the market vertically from manufacturing to production up to retail. 

Marijuana Industry Overview
 
Marijuana cultivation refers to the planting, tending, improving and harvesting of the flowering plant Cannabis, primarily for the production and consumption of cannabis flowers, often referred to as “buds.” The cultivation techniques for marijuana cultivation differ for other purposes such as hemp production and generally references to marijuana cultivation and production do not include hemp.
 
Cannabis belongs to the genus Cannabis in the family Cannabaceae and for the purposes of production and consumption, includes three species, C. sativa (“Sativa”), C. indica (“Indica”), and C. ruderalis (“Ruderalis”). Sativa and Indica generally grow tall with some varieties reaching approximately four meters. The females produce flowers rich in tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Ruderalis is a short plant and produces trace amounts of THC but is very rich in cannabidiol (“CBD”) and which is an antagonist (inhibits the physiological action) to THC.

As of December 2018, there are a total of 33 states, plus the District of Columbia, with legislation passed as it relates to medicinal cannabis. Of these states, 10 have decriminalized adult use cannabis legislation. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse, has no currently-accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S., and lacks acceptable safety for use under medical supervision.
 
These 33 states, and the District of Columbia, have adopted laws that exempt patients who use medicinal cannabis under a physician’s supervision from state criminal penalties. These are collectively referred to as the states that have de-criminalized medicinal cannabis, although there is a subtle difference between de-criminalization and legalization, and each state’s laws are different.
 
The states that have legalized medicinal cannabis are as follows (in alphabetical order):
 


1 | . | Alaska | 12 | . | Maine | 23 | . | New York 
---+---+-------------+----+---+-------------------+----+---+------------------
2 | . | Arizona | 13 | . | Maryland | 24 | . | North Dakota 
3 | . | Arkansas | 14 | . | Massachusetts | 25 | . | Ohio 
4 | . | California | 15 | . | Michigan | 26 | . | Oklahoma 
5 | . | Colorado | 16 | . | Minnesota | 27 | . | Oregon 
6 | . | Connecticut | 17 | . | Missouri | 28 | . | Pennsylvania 
7 | . | Delaware | 18 | . | Montana | 29 | . | Rhode Island 
8 | . | Florida | 19 | . | Nevada | 30 | . | Utah 
9 | . | Hawaii | 20 | . | New Hampshire | 31 | . | Vermont 
10 | . | Illinois | 21 | . | New Jersey | 32 | . | Washington

Medical cannabis decriminalization is generally referred to as the removal of all criminal penalties for the private possession and use of cannabis by adults, including cultivation for personal use and casual, nonprofit transfers of small amounts. Legalization is generally referred to as the development of a legally controlled market for cannabis, where consumers purchase from a safe, legal, and regulated source.
 
The dichotomy between federal and state laws has limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Treasury have issued guidance for banks considering conducting business with marijuana dispensaries in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must file a Marijuana Limited Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government’s guidelines with regard to revenue that is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, as banks can still face prosecution if they provide financial services to marijuana businesses, there is widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to marijuana businesses operating within state and local laws.
 
In November 2016, California and Nevada voters both approved marijuana use for adults over the age of 21 without a physician’s prescription or recommendation, and permitted the cultivation and sale of marijuana, in each case subject to certain limitations. We have obtained the necessary permits and licenses to expand our existing business to cultivate and distribute marijuana in compliance with the laws in the State of Nevada and California. Despite the changes in state laws, marijuana remains illegal under federal law.
 
In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which is also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“the AUMA”), in a ballot initiative. Among other things, the AUMA makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to 28.5 grams of marijuana flowers and 8 grams of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, the AUMA establishes a licensing system for businesses to, among other things, cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. On January 1, 2018, the California Bureau of Marijuana Control enacted regulations to implement the AUMA.

Nevada voters approved Question 2 in a ballot initiative in November 2016. Among other things, Question 2 makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, Question 2 authorizes businesses to cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. On June 30, 2017, the State of Nevada Department of Taxation approved our Dual-Use Marijuana business licenses. This approval allowed all four of our Blüm cannabis dispensaries in Nevada to commence sales of cannabis for adult-use beginning on July 1, 2017.
 
The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits.
 
We are monitoring the Trump administration’s, the DOJ’s and Congress’ positions on federal marijuana law and policy. Since the start of the new Congress in January 2019, there have been positive discussions about the Federal Government’s approach to cannabis. The DOJ has not signaled any change in their enforcement efforts. Based on public statements and reports, we understand that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.
 
Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and adult use is permitted in California and Nevada, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable Nevada and California laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
 

• | Real Estate – Includes building ownership and construction operations where cannabis dispensary and/or cultivation operations are currently in development 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Real Estate and Construction Operations
 
We own real property in Pueblo, Colorado on which we plan to build a cultivation operation for Hemp once we have completed payment for water and mineral rights. Additionally, we own equity interest within a 15,000 sq. ft. licensed manufacturing and cultivation facility based in San Juan, Puerto Rico including investments in infrastructure and equipment through a five- year operations and licensing agreement with our licensed partners 1919 Clinic. We have the first option to purchase the building under our licensee 1919 Clinic LLC, licensed by the Department of Health of Puerto Rico to produce and manufacture cannabis products.
 
Agritek Holdings Inc. intends to build on its existing relationships by developing operating plans and providing oversight, strategy and management of the business units’ growth and integration. Further, Agritek Holdings plans to continue expanding its reach by building new partnerships with vertical market partners and end- user products companies as well as exploring opportunities with successful cultivators and processors. Through its expansion efforts, Agritek Holdings intends to utilize online sales and marketing platforms, participate in relevant trade shows and develop various advertising materials to communicate its multiple licensed brands including “MD Vapes” “California Premiums”, “Hemp Pops” and additional CBD products.
 
Agritek Holdings is also well-positioned to participate in the large and growing legal cannabis market for enhanced downstream cannabis products and new products with various consumer and medical applications.

Agritek Holdings focuses on the growth of its business units and expanding their reach to end-users and partners. Although the business units are primarily responsible for developing and operating their respective businesses, Agritek Holdings is available to provide functional expertise, financing, oversight and a framework of disciplined planning to the operations of the business units when needed.
 
Agritek Holdings’ short-term objective is to create a sustainable business in the key states of California, Colorado, Washington and Oregon as well as in Canada and Puerto Rico by integrating its holdings to create synergies and true end-to-end solutions geared to the needs of patients and consumers. Agritek Holdings has positioned itself for commercial growth by focusing its expanded resource base on finding and partnering with the best and most innovative companies, projects, assets and overall business frameworks in the legal cannabis sector in the aforementioned jurisdictions.
 
To achieve its objectives, the Company will continue making specific and deliberate investments, including acquisitions, to:
 

1. | Increase the diversity and quality of the Company’s product offerings across different market segments; and 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Increase the strength and segmentation of the Company’s diversified portfolio of real estate holdings and product brands. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, management believes that significant opportunities exist today and will develop further in the future, to leverage the Company’s expertise, financial strength and business model in legal cannabis markets around the world. Agritek Holdings intends on pursuing opportunities in a number of jurisdictions where cannabis use is legal, and/or where governments are actively pursuing legalization.
 
Subject to legislative and regulatory compliance, strategic business opportunities pursued by the Company could include:
 

1. | Providing advisory services to third-parties that are interested in establishing licensed cannabis cultivation, processing and sales operations; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Entering into strategic relationships that create value by sharing expertise and industry knowledge; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Providing capital in the form of debt, royalties, or equity to new business units; and 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Entering into licensing agreements to generate revenue, create strategic partnerships, or other business opportunities. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Agritek Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Agritek Venture Holdings, Inc. American Hemp Trading Company Inc. and Mediswipe Inc. provide turnkey support solutions to the legal cannabis industry. We provide key business services to the legal cannabis sector including:
 


• | Funding and Financing Solutions for Agricultural Land and Properties zoned for the regulated Cannabis Industry. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Dispensary and Retail Solutions 
• | Commercial Production and Equipment Build Out Solutions 
• | Banking and Payment Processing Solutions 
• | Multichannel Supply Chain Solutions 
• | Branding, Marketing and Sales Solutions of proprietary product lines 
• | Consumer Product Solutions 

 
The Company intends to bring its’ array of services to each new state that legalizes the use of cannabis according to appropriate state and federal laws. Our primary objective is acquiring commercial properties to be utilized in the commercial marijuana industry as cultivation facilities in compliance with state law. This is an essential aspect of our overall growth strategy because once acquired and re-zoned, the value of such real property is substantially higher than under the previous zoning and use.

Once properties are identified and acquired to be used for purposes related to the commercial marijuana industry as provided for by state law, and we plan to create vertical channels within that legal jurisdiction including equipment financing, payment processing and marketing of exclusive brands and services to retail dispensaries
 
Agritek’s business focus is primarily to hold, develop and manage real property. The Company shall also provide oversight on every property that is part of its portfolio. This can include complete architectural design and subsequent build-outs, general support, landscaping, general up-keep, and state of the art security systems. At this time, Agritek does not grow, process, own, handle, transport, or sell marijuana as the Company is organized and directed to operate strictly in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws.
 
Services and Markets
 
To date, we have purchased eighty (80) acres approved for licenses and cultivation in Pueblo, Colorado. We have multiple manufacturing and service contracts in place in areas which include the state of Colorado, California and the territory of Puerto Rico.
Funding and Financing Solutions
 
Our goal is to become the funding and financing service partner of choice in the legal Colorado and California cannabis market before expanding nationwide if and when applicable state and federal law allows us to do so. We offer financing and financial aid to cultivators, collectives, dispensaries and product businesses in the legal cannabis industry with alternative funding and financing solutions. In the evolving legal cannabis industry, where traditional banking opportunities are grossly limited, we step in to provide the “traditional” bank lending services; lines of credit, property financing, and/or commercial loans. Businesses and individuals seeking funding and financing solutions are qualified and scored based on their experience, current operations, financial records, and compliance grades given by our proprietary banking partners and credit lines that comply with all state governance rules.
Commercial Build Out and Dispensary Solutions
 
We offer turnkey build-out and commercial services to our clients. Whether it is financial assistance, real estate consulting, operations design, or building construction or brand development our Company can design and rollout customized services for our clients. We also offer traditional business services to dispensaries as well. These services include infrastructure investment, technology partners, donation accounting, payment processing and succession strategies. It is important to note that we are not a “one size fits all” organization, but are committed to custom tailored solutions for legal cannabis industry participants.
Finance and Real Estate
 
Real Estate Leasing
 
Our real estate leasing business primarily includes the acquisition and leasing of cultivation space and related facilities to licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners for their operations. Management anticipates that these facilities will range in size from 5,000 to 50,000 square feet. These facilities will only be leased to tenants that possess the requisite state licenses to operate cultivation facilities. The leases with the tenants will provide certain requirements that permit us to continually evaluate our tenants’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 
As of the date of this report, we own one cultivation property that is located in a suburb of Pueblo, Colorado (the “Pueblo West Property”). The property consists of approximately eighty (80) acres of land. The property is currently zoned for cultivating cannabis and is expected to be leased to a medical cannabis cultivator or manufacturer this year. We are currently evaluating strategic options for this property.
 
Puerto Rico
 We presently maintain a five (5) year operation and licensing agreement for a 15,000 sq. ft. licensed manufacturing facility in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Under the terms of the agreement, we provide financing for build out, equipment leasing and purchase and development of cannabis brands for legal distribution in Puerto Rico. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is entitled to revenue based on consulting fees, rent, and brand royalties up to 30 per cent.

Shared Office Space, Networking and Event Services  
 
We plan to continue to acquire commercial real estate and lease office space to participants in the cannabis industry. These participants include media, internet, packaging, lighting, cultivation supplies, and financial services. In exchange for certain services that may be provided to these tenants, we expect to receive rental income. In certain cases, we may acquire equity interests or provide debt capital to these businesses and eventually acquire a specific business as a wholly owned subsidiary of Agritek.
Industry Finance and Equipment Leasing Services
 
We plan to lease cultivation equipment and facilities to customers in the cannabis industry. We expect we will enter into sale lease-back transactions of land zoned for cultivation, green houses, grow lights, tenant improvements and other grow equipment. Since Colorado State law does not allow entities operating under a cannabis license to pledge the assets or the license of the cannabis operation for any type of general borrowing activity, we intend to provide loans to individuals and businesses in the cannabis industry on an unsecured basis. Equipment will only be leased to tenants that possess the requisite state licenses to operate such facilities. The leases with the tenants will provide certain requirements that permit us to continually evaluate its tenants’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 
Our finance strategy will include making direct term loans and providing revolving lines of credit to businesses involved in the cultivation and sale of cannabis and related products. These loans will generally be secured to the maximum extent permitted by law. We believe there is a significant demand for this financing. We are pursuing other finance services including customized finance, capital formation, and banking, for participants in the cannabis industry.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we possess certain competitive strengths and advantages in the industries which we operate:
 
Range of Services:  We are able to leverage our breadth of services and resources to deliver a comprehensive, integrated solution to companies in the cannabis industry – from operational and compliance consulting to security and marketing to financing needs.
 
Strategic Alliances.  We are dedicated to rapid growth through acquisitions, partnerships and agreements that will enable us to enter and expand into new markets. Our strategy in pursuing these alliances are based on the target’s ability to generate positive cash flow, effectively meet customer needs, and supply desirable products, services or technologies, among other considerations. We anticipate that strategic alliances will play a significant role as more states pass legislation permitting the cultivation and sale of hemp and cannabis.
 

Industry Breadth.  We continue to create, share and leverage information and experiences with the purpose of creating awareness and identifying opportunities to increase shareholder value. Our management team has extensive knowledge of the cannabis industry and closely monitors changes in legislation. We work with partners who enhance our industry breadth.
 
Intellectual Property
 
On November 17, 2016, we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) a federal trademark registration for “Hemp Pops” in the category of Staple Food Products.
Competition
 
Currently, there are a number of other companies that provide similar products and/or services, such as direct finance, leasing of real estate, including shared workspace, warehouse sales, and consulting services to the cannabis industry. In the future we fully expect that other companies will recognize the value of ancillary businesses serving the cannabis industry and enter into the marketplace as competitors.

The cannabis industry in the United States is highly fragmented, rapidly expanding and evolving. The industry is characterized by new and potentially disruptive or conflicting legislation propounded on a state-by-state basis. Our competitors may be local or international enterprises and may have financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources greater than ours. These companies may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and consultants.
 
Our competitive position will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified underwriters, investment banking partners and loan managers, consultants and advisors with industry depth, and talented managerial, operational and other personnel. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to develop and acquire effective proprietary products and solutions, personal relationships of our executive officers and directors, and our ability to secure adequate capital resources. We compete to attract and retain customers of our services. We expect to compete in this area on the basis of price, regulatory compliance, vendor relationships, usefulness, availability, and ease of use of our services.
 
FinCEN
 
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidance on February 14, 2014 about how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) obligations. For purposes of the FinCEN guidelines, a “financial institution” includes any person doing business in one or more of the following capacities:
 

• | Bank (except bank credit card systems); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Broker or dealer in securities; 
• | Money services business; 
• | Telegraph company; 
• | Casino; 
• | Card club; and 
• | A person subject to supervision by any state or federal bank supervisory authority. 

 
In general, the decision to open, close, or refuse any particular account or relationship should be made by each financial institution based on a number of factors specific to that institution. These factors may include its particular business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering a particular product or service, and its capacity to manage those risks effectively. Thorough customer due diligence is a critical aspect of making this assessment.
 
In assessing the risk of providing services to a cannabis-related business, a financial institution should conduct customer due diligence that includes: (i) verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; (ii) reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its cannabis-related business; (iii) requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; (iv) developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus recreational customers); (v) ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; (vi) ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and (vii) refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.
 
As part of its customer due diligence, a financial institution should consider whether a cannabis-related business violates state law. This is a particularly important factor for a financial institution to consider when assessing the risk of providing financial services to a cannabis-related business. Considering this factor also enables the financial institution to provide information in BSA reports pertinent to law enforcement’s priorities. A financial institution that decides to provide financial services to a cannabis-related business would be required to file suspicious activity reports.

While we believe we do not qualify as a financial institution in the United States, we cannot be certain that we do not fall under the scope of the FinCEN guidelines. We plan to use the FinCEN Guidelines, as may be amended, as a basis for assessing our relationships with potential tenants, clients and customers. As such, as we engage in financing activities, we intend to adhere to the guidance of FinCEN in conducting and monitoring our financial transactions. Because this area of the law is uncertain but expected to evolve rapidly, we believe that FinCEN’s guidelines will help us best operate in a prudent, reasonable and acceptable manner. There is no assurance, however, that our activities will not violate some aspect of the CSA. If we are found to violate the federal statute or any other in connection with our activities, our company could face serious criminal and civil sanctions.
 
We intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in. We realize that there is a discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities. The CSA makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense cannabis. Many states impose and enforce similar prohibitions. Notwithstanding the federal ban, as of the date of this filing, twenty-six states and the District of Columbia have legalized certain cannabis-related activity.
 
Moreover, since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, we may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts and insurance and our stockholders may find it difficult to deposit their stock with brokerage firms.
 
Employees
 
Other than the Company’s sole officer and director, we do not have any full-time employees. The Company relies on several independent contractors and other agreements it has with other companies to provide the services needed. Each contractor has been carefully selected to address immediate needs in particular functional areas, but also with consideration of the Company’s future needs during a period of expected rapid growth and expansion. Value is placed not only on outstanding credentials in specific areas of functional expertise, but also on cross-functionality, a strong knowledge of content acquisition and distribution, along with hands-on experience in scaling operations from initial beta and development stage through successful commercial deployment.
