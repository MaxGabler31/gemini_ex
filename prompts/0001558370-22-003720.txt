Overview
Who We Are
Porch is a vertical software platform for the home, providing software and services to over 24,000 home services companies, such as home inspectors, mortgage companies and loan officers, title companies, moving companies, real estate agencies, utility companies, roofers, and others. Porch helps these service providers grow their business and improve their customer experience. Porch also makes the moving process easier for homebuyers by helping them save time and make better decisions about critical services, including insurance, warranty, moving, security, TV/Internet, home repair and improvement. For certain services such as insurance and warranty, Porch can provide its own product to consumers.
Porch has two reportable segments: the Vertical Software segment and the Insurance segment.
Porch’s Vertical Software segment provides software and services to home services companies and, through these relationships, earns SaaS fees and gains unique and early access to homebuyers and homeowners. This early access allows Porch to assist homebuyers and homeowners with critical services such as moving, and, in turn, Porch’s platform drives demand for other services from such companies as part of our value proposition. The Vertical Software segment has three types of customers: (1) home services companies, such as home inspectors, for whom Porch provides software and services to help them make their businesses run more efficiently and grow; (2) consumers, such as homebuyers and homeowners, whom Porch assists with the comparison and provision of various critical home services, such as moving, security, TV/Internet, and home repair and improvement; and (3) service providers, such as moving companies, insurance companies, warranty companies, security companies and TV/Internet providers, who pay Porch for new customer sign-ups.
Our Insurance segment offers various property-related insurance policies through our own risk-bearing carrier and independent agency as well as a risk-bearing home warranty company. Third-party insurance companies pay Porch’s agency upfront and renewal commissions for selling their policies, reinsurers pay Porch ceding commissions when we cede premiums from our owned insurance products, and we earn revenues in the form of policy premiums collected from insureds from our owned insurance products. The Insurance segment also includes home warranty revenue which mainly consists of premiums paid by warranty customers for Porch’s home warranty products.
Porch operates under a number of brands in both the Vertical Software and Insurance segments, such as:

Background and Corporate History
Porch.com, Inc., our principal operating subsidiary, was incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 22, 2011, and officially launched as Porch.com, Inc. on September 17, 2013. We launched Porch with the goal of simplifying the homebuying, move-in and home maintenance process. We began as a data-driven home services marketplace, delivering project requests to home improvement professionals across the country who make up part of the greater than $500 billion estimated North American home improvement market.1 After two (2) years of growth, and with key learnings in hand, Porch expanded its offerings by providing software and service to home services companies, transitioning to a vertical software company focused on the home. We knew that we wanted to focus on individuals making critical and high-value purchase decisions at the start of their homeowning journey. We also knew that we wanted to partner with home services companies to create long-term defensible and proprietary access to these consumers. As of the end of 2021, over 24,000 businesses — home inspectors, mortgage companies, title companies, moving companies, large utilities, roofing companies and more — use Porch to improve their operations, grow their business, and improve their customer experiences. These partnerships provide Porch introductions to end customers (who are largely homebuyers or existing homeowners) to help make their move and home maintenance simpler. This access is unique, wide-ranging and early in the homebuying process. 
Since its founding, Porch has established many partnerships across a number of home-related industries and has also proven effective at selectively acquiring companies that can be efficiently integrated into Porch’s platform. These acquisitions include: AHP, Floify, HireAHelperTM, HOA, iRoofing, ISNTM, Palm-Tech, Rynoh, V12 Data, and as well as the signing of an agreement to purchase CSE, a California based insurance carrier, which is expected to close in mid-2022. We remain committed to pursuing attractive mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) opportunities as a key part of our growth strategy going forward as a public company. Porch Group, Inc. was originally known as PropTech Acquisition Corporation, a Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company (“PTAC”), which completed its initial public offering in November 2019. In July 2020, PTAC entered into a merger agreement to acquire Porch.com, Inc., and on December 23, 2020 (the “PTAC Merger Closing Date”), the merger was completed and Porch.com, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PTAC. On the same date, PTAC changed its name from “PropTech Acquisition Corporation” to “Porch Group, Inc.,” and Porch Group, Inc.’s common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker “PRCH.” References in this Annual Report to Porch prior to the PTAC Merger Closing Date refer to Porch.com, Inc.
The Porch Platform
Porch provides software and services to home services companies, and, through these relationships, gains unique and early access to homebuyers and homeowners, assists homebuyers and homeowners with critical services such as insurance and moving, and, in turn, Porch’s platform drives demand for other services from such companies as part of our value proposition.

​
Software and Services for Home Services Companies
Porch’s platform provides home services companies with software and services to help them grow their business and provide a better experience for their customers. This value proposition can be divided into three components.
First, Porch offers leading vertical-specific software that includes a wide range of functionality required by home services companies like home inspectors, mortgage companies, titles companies, roofers, and moving services providers to run a better business. These software solutions include features such as configurable dashboards, calendars and scheduling, online booking, payment processing, dispatch and routing optimization, customer relations and communications, point of sale interfaces, flexible reporting, industry integrations, reporting writing, quoting and more. Companies use this software for their customers and transactions, managing their employees and tracking their partners. The depth of functionality varies among industry-specific products. Because this software is used in so many aspects of day-to-day management by home services companies such as home inspectors, Porch sees high retention rates among our software customer base.
Second, Porch offers a Moving Concierge service that home services companies can provide to their end customers in order to improve the moving and home improvement experience. Instead of the relationship ending once the initial service is complete, home services companies can offer Porch’s Moving Concierge to assist an end customer with the remaining aspects of their move and, going forward, with ongoing home maintenance. Each Moving Concierge customer is provided with a self-service dashboard through which they can manage their moving “to do” list. A Porch Moving Concierge representative will also contact the customer to talk about their home inspection, answer questions, collect a review for the company, and chart out all upcoming services with which Porch can assist. Instead of selling customer data as leads, Porch helps the end customer compare prices and make decisions about critical services such as insurance (as both a licensed nationwide insurance agent as well as a carrier in certain states), moving, security, and TV/Internet. This experience creates a positive end customer experience that can benefit the home services company.

Third, Porch can help home services companies to grow their business through new customer acquisition. Porch does this through its various digital and concierge experiences and marketing solutions. Home services companies can pay for Porch’s software and certain modules with business-to-business (“B2B”) SaaS fees. In certain verticals, principally home inspection, companies also have the ability to access Porch’s core software offering for free if they provide Porch with access and introductions to their end customers by providing each with Porch’s Moving Concierge experience. This allows Porch to generate business-to-business-to-customer (“B2B2C”) transaction revenues by offering high-value services to end customers. We believe combination of this value proposition is compelling, as this allows Porch to achieve a very strong home services company lifetime value to acquisition cost ratio.
Consumer Services
Porch connects consumers with home services companies nationwide and offers a full range of products and services where homeowners can, among other things: (i) compare and buy home insurance and warranty policies (along with auto, flood and umbrella policies) with competitive rates and coverage; (ii) arrange for a variety of services in connection with their move, from labor to load or unload a truck to full-service, long-distance moving services; (iii) discover and install home automation and security systems; (iv) compare Internet and television options for their new home; (v) book small handyman jobs at fixed, upfront prices with guaranteed quality; and (vi) compare bids from home improvement professionals who can complete bigger jobs.
Porch focuses on the move stage of the homeowner’s journey given the concentration of high value services that are purchased during this time. During the move, Porch assists the customer with services via its Moving Concierge and moving dashboard experience. For example, after helping the consumer quickly compare a large set of options for homeowner’s insurance for the new home, Porch will bind coverage as a licensed insurance agent and connect it back to the homebuyer’s mortgage. In the 15 states where Porch is currently licensed as an insurance carrier, we can offer consumers our own insurance products. Additionally, Porch offers home warranty products to protect critical systems and appliances typically not covered under homeowners’ insurance. Further, Porch can highlight a variety of options and pricing for any type of move, including truck, storage and labor booking. For TV and internet service, Porch provides the consumer a wide variety of rates, options and promotions for all major TV and internet providers in their area and activates service directly for the consumer. According to a survey conducted by Article and OnePoll, moving was one of the most highly stressful moments in a consumer’s life, and across each of these services, Porch helps the consumer quickly and easily select the right products for them.
After the move, Porch provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local professionals to complete most types of home maintenance, repair and improvement projects. Homeowners simply submit a project request on the Porch website, and Porch matches the homeowner with local professionals in their area who have the skills to do the job. Porch then sends the homeowner contact details about the service professionals they have been matched with, so the homeowner can select the right person or company for the job. Professionals can create profiles on Porch.com, but we also partner with both large service provider companies as well as large networks of service providers. This enables Porch to offer consumers various high-quality options without having to build a large sales force or operate as a standalone marketplace.
Our Industry
The home is foundational to the American experience. According to data from the National Association of Realtors and the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 6.12 million existing homes sold and approximately 762,000 newly constructed homes sold in the United States in 20212. There are millions of home services companies, most of which are small businesses operating in fragmented markets, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy. For consumers, moving and maintenance can be full of pitfalls and headaches. Porch seeks to simplify the home by providing software and services to home services companies and connecting homeowners to high-quality services throughout the home lifecycle. In doing so, Porch conducts its business across a broad total addressable market (“TAM”) beyond its software and service offerings, consisting of moving services, property and casualty (“P&C”) insurance,

contractor services, and mover marketing with an estimated total value of approximately $350 billion. This TAM is based on the products Porch offers today, with ample opportunity for expansion of Porch’s addressable market.
​
Moving Services
Porch provides three primary moving services that support homeowners during the moving process: direct moving services, security installations and TV/Internet installations. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data and Porch management estimates, Porch believes the overall addressable opportunity for Porch in these three service offerings in the U.S. to be approximately $4.7 billion. This estimate assumes that of the approximately 6 million annual home sales, approximately 20% will result in a home security purchase (according to industry and management estimates), which at approximately $1,100 per sale results in a $1.3 billion security installation TAM. The TV/Internet installation TAM assumes all homebuyers will get some combination of TV and Internet service at an average commission per household of $125. Based on industry estimates, currently approximately 4% of homes have solar installed; the Solar Energy Industries Association estimates that 13.4% of homes will have solar installed by 2030. Assuming 9.4% of households purchase solar panels at time of home purchase, approximately 564,000 consumers will purchase solar annually. Porch estimates an average commission of $1,350 per solar installation resulting in an annual TAM of approximately $761 million. This also assumes each home sale results in one move and that Porch can receive $321 net commission per move (which is a mix between full service moves and labor only moves), thereby creating a $1.9 billion moving service TAM. Porch bases these net commission assumptions on a review of existing customer purchasing patterns and revenue contributions of commissions.
​
Property and Casualty (P&C) Insurance
Through its wholly-owned licensed insurance agency, EIG, Porch serves customers in the P&C home, auto, flood, and umbrella insurance market. In addition, Porch operates its own risk-bearing insurance carrier, HOA, a leading property and casualty insurance company focused on products in the residential homeowner space. Based on U.S. home insurance annual revenues of $119 billion plus U.S. auto insurance annual revenues of $311 billion, Porch believes the P&C home and auto insurance TAM is approximately $181 billion.3 With the acquisition of AHP, Porch also operates its own home warranty business in a market estimated to be worth $4.5 billion for the combined home warranty and utility service line4.
​
Contractor Services
Contractor services is another large portion of Porch’s TAM with an estimated size of approximately $150 billion. This estimate is based on management’s estimate of a greater than $500 billion valuation of the home improvement market. It assumes 50% of projects are fully managed and coordinated by Porch (i.e., where Porch provides or manages services directly to or on behalf of homeowners) with a 45% take rate ($113 billion managed services TAM) and 50% of projects are referred to third parties without any coordination by Porch for a 15% referral fee ($38 billion referral services TAM). The assumptions surrounding the percentage split between managed and outsourced projects, gross margins, and referral fees are based on Porch’s historical experience.
Mover Marketing
Mover Marketing represents Porch’s opportunity to sell marketing technology and services that help advertisers retain existing customers and attract new customers at key moments in time, such as during the homebuying process. Porch estimates this TAM in the U.S. as $9.7 billion based on 6 million homebuyers annually spending an average of

$10,726 within the first 12 months of moving5, and of this $64 billion in spend, Porch estimates that companies will spend 15% on marketing to these consumers based on what it has observed in the industries it serves.
​
Trends and Growth in the Housing and Home Maintenance Sectors
Home Sales
As a home services platform that provides core software and services to over 24,000 home services companies, Porch’s revenue is in part linked to existing home sales. While the market saw a dip during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, volume of sales have continued to be robust with December, 2021 seeing an annual rate of almost 6.2 million existing homes sold, per the National Association of Realtors. America is a mobile country, with the average American homeowner moving once every 13 years, according to the National Association of Realtors. Research from the National Association of Realtors shows several reasons for Americans moving, with the most frequent reasons being to find a new or better home, to start or transfer jobs or to establish a new family home for the first time.
Buying a Home and Moving Is Becoming More Complex
Moving is considered one of the most stressful life events. The list of decisions a buyer needs to make begin with the qualities and attributes of the new home. There is a growing list of factors that go into choosing a home, including, but not limited to, home affordability, safety, quality of schools and proximity to parks, recreational facilities, health centers and outdoor space. When purchasers do find the right home, they might face a competitive process where their bid is ultimately rejected. Once their bid is accepted, home buyers have to manage home inspections and finalize their mortgage by meeting lender requirements.
With the house purchase offer accepted, homebuyers then must deal with the complexity of and logistics of moving. Pre-move considerations include but are not limited to researching moving services, visiting new communities, booking rentals, reserving storage units, coordinating with movers on packing, transferring utilities, home cleaning, completing a change of address, purchasing home insurance, and purchasing a home warranty. Within the moving company market alone, according to the American Trucking Associations, there are over thousands of moving companies in over 16,522 locations to choose from. Post-move considerations include but are not limited to unpacking, cleaning the new house, scheduling essential home improvements listed in the inspection report, changing locks, transferring medical records, registering vehicles, purchasing Internet and setting up a security system. All of these considerations make moving a stressful and arduous process.
Porch helps make the move simpler through its Moving Concierge and related services. Homebuyers can use Porch’s self-service dashboard to compare prices for movers, provision move-related services, and manage their moving checklist. Customers are also offered a wide variety of home services. Ultimately, Porch makes moving less stressful.
Increasing Home Improvement Spending
After helping consumers with their move, Porch continues to say in touch with the movers to help with home maintenance and improvement projects. The continued growth of the home improvement spending market will have a substantial impact on Porch’s future revenues. The home improvement market has continued to grow and is estimated at over $500 billion in size.
Outsourcing of Specialized Home Improvement Projects
According to iPropertyManagement, four out of five homeowners hire a professional or licensed specialist to assist on typical home projects such as window replacements, roof repairs, heating, ventilation and air conditioning installations, and others, and 87% of home renovations utilized a service professional in 2018. Porch helps make finding these professionals easy and offers transparent pricing.

Digitalization of Home Services
According to Technavio, online on-demand home services are expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of over 70% from 2021 to 2025. Driving this trend are the digitally minded millennial and Gen Z generations that are entering the home ownership market and hiring home services professionals online. Home service professionals experiencing the benefits and scalability of connecting and engaging with consumers online, including reaching wider or targeted audiences, improving conversion rates, reducing acquisition costs, and tracking performance of marketing investments, are expected to invest more into digital offerings over time.
Our Competitive Strengths
Leading Software with over 24,000 Contracted Companies in a Diverse Set of Industries
Porch owns several leading software platform brands including ISN and Palm-Tech for home inspectors, Floify for mortgage companies and loan officers, Rynoh for title companies and HireAHelper for moving companies, iRoofing for roofers. Porch provides software that helps these companies manage and grow their business such as CRM, ERP and POS modules to over 24,000 companies across a number of home services verticals utilizing its various software brands. 
Early Access to Demand
Porch’s early access to homebuyers allows Porch to be among the first service providers to reach out to consumers and to assist them in their moving journey prior to completing many large purchasing decisions. Porch receives access to these homebuyers through its software customers in the various verticals where it operates. In some verticals, home services companies have the option to opt into Porch’s customer access model and receive a core module from Porch’s software for free in exchange for access rights to their customers. This gives Porch the opportunity to market and offer services to these customers up to and before six weeks in advance of their move. Porch’s customer access model represents an extremely valuable marketing tool and customer acquisition platform for home services providers, who typically rely on a change of address request that occurs near the end of the moving journey to reach out to homebuyers.
Porch’s software for home inspectors is the software of choice for a significant portion of inspection companies including most of the largest inspection companies in the U.S. These inspection companies complete over a quarter of all U.S. home inspections through Porch’s software and services. 
Through research and development, Porch continues to invest in and strengthen the software advantage of its software offerings. Moreover, Porch expects to increase the percentage of U.S. homebuyers available through its customer access model by expanding sales efforts, by developing new products and tools for its current verticals, and by offering software and services in new home services sectors.
Innovative Customer Access Pricing Model
Porch utilizes a customer access model in certain verticals whereby software customers receive access to a core element of Porch’s software for free in exchange for providing access rights to their customers. This structure reduces competition from traditional software providers that rely solely on fee revenue to sustain their businesses. In addition to obtaining the that portion of the software for free, inspection companies are able to differentiate their offering by providing the Porch Moving Concierge to their consumers at a critical time of need. As a result, Porch benefits from high retention rates among software customers. 
Proprietary Data and Analytics
Through the services it offers, Porch has access to a trove of proprietary data on homebuyers and their homes. Using this data, Porch intends to continue its investment in data science and analytics to provide more suitable services to homebuyers and improve service provider marketing opportunities. For example, Porch believes that its data could help improve Porch’s ability to predict a variety of events, including the timing and likelihood of specific purchase decisions

around the home, a mover’s likelihood of switching insurance carriers or the likelihood and severity of home insurance and home warranty claims. V12 Data provides software and data solutions to help brands, and small and medium sized businesses acquire new customers and improve their marketing, and helps Porch leverage its own proprietary mover.
Strong Management Team with Extensive Merger and Acquisition Experience
Porch’s management team has significant merger and acquisition and integration experience obtained through over a hundred merger and acquisition transactions between the CEO, CFO and head of corporate development during their employment at previous companies. Porch has a strong track record of driving significant value creation from acquisitions to date. Porch intends to leverage its acquisition experience by continuing to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions of software companies that strengthen Porch’s unique access to demand as well as services where Porch’s early access to homebuyer consumers and unique data provide significant differentiation.
Comprehensive Service Offering
Porch offers a unique breadth and depth of home services that span the entire homeownership experience from the move to ongoing maintenance. Not only is Porch able to help a consumer with the services they need at any point in their journey with their home, but also by going deeper into select services such as insurance, moving, and handyman services, Porch is able to improve the consumer experience and capture more value. This ability to create value from consumers allows Porch to offer a unique and strong value proposition to companies who provide Porch access to their customers. Because we are able to drive value to the companies that use our products and services, we are more easily able to attract new business partners and invest in product development and customer support to ensure we sustain our competitive advantage.
Our Strategies for Growth
Porch aims to achieve its strategic plan by driving organic growth and executing attractive acquisition opportunities. Porch intends to continue focusing on growth that will positively impact long-term shareholder value through the following strategies:
Sell More Software and Gain Access to More Homebuyers
Porch’s software not only generates strong B2B SaaS revenues, but it is also a valuable and low-cost customer acquisition tool that drives growth through expanded homebuyer access. Porch intends to expand its B2B SaaS fees and homeowner access by:

● | Increasing the number of software customers organically through expanded sales and marketing efforts and inorganically through SaaS acquisitions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Upselling into these software customers additional SaaS modules for B2B SaaS fees.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing to develop long-term relationships with software customers, while increasing B2B SaaS fees as Porch helps these companies grow.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing the percentage of software customers that grant access rights to their consumers. Porch works to convert more of its software customers to this option by explaining its benefits, which include increased end customer satisfaction, to companies during Porch’s software training program. In some verticals such as mortgage, this is a strategic benefit to the company utilizing Porch’s software – by providing insurance solutions that are required to be purchased by a borrower, Porch can increase a loan officer’s close rate and reduce time to close.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11



Increase Revenue per Homebuyer
Porch intends to capitalize on its expanded homebuyer access by increasing the revenue generated from each homebuyer by:

● | Improving the digital shopping experience for consumers who prefer to purchase online.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing the percentage of individuals with access rights that are called, contacted, and engaged by Porch’s Moving Concierge call center team.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Making available additional high-margin services for these homebuyers, such as solar installation and increasing the market access for certain services only offered in select geographies, such as Porch’s insurance solutions through HOA and home warranty products through AHP.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing conversion and take rates of both existing and new services by offering more services competitive quotes per service to incentivize customers to not leave the Porch ecosystem.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Generating more revenue from certain services by handling more of the experience for the consumer, such as how Porch takes a larger role in providing insurance and home warranty products via HOA and AHP.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mover Marketing
Today, companies of all shapes and sizes advertise to movers through direct mail after the consumers have moved into their new home and change their address with the United States Postal Service. Through Porch’s early access to homebuyers, Porch helps homebuyers obtain earlier access to discounts and promotions that are typically made available to movers, while helping these brands and advertisers send direct mail to consumers in advance of their move.



On January 12, 2021, the Company acquired V12 Data, a leading consumer data and analytics platform with a focus on household and mover insights, data management and marketing activation. The V12 Data acquisition and the mover marketing businesses provide Porch with full-spectrum, enterprise-grade capabilities to capture the unique-to-the-market pre-mover marketing opportunity.
Insurance Expansion in 2021
EIG, Porch’s wholly owned subsidiary, is an insurance agent that is currently licensed in all 50 states. Porch has expanded from solely operating an insurance agency to, by acquiring HOA, offering its own products through this risk-bearing carrier. By operating as a carrier, Porch intends to capitalize on the underwriting advantage provided by its unique insights into properties and homebuyers. The carrier structure allows Porch to obtain reinsurance ceding commissions higher than what is earned through third-party commissions via EIG and participate in the upside of selecting good risks with lower claims. By ceding a significant portion of insurance premiums, Porch reduces earnings volatility and the capital required for the insurance carrier. Additional potential growth opportunities for Porch’s insurance business include expanding from the 15 states where it operates HOA, as of February 2022, and adding more insurance carriers as partners. 
On September 9, 2021, Porch completed its acquisition of AHP, a Texas-based provider of whole home warranty policies across the U.S. AHP utilizes a direct-to-consumer model to acquire customers for their multi-year warranty plans. Additionally, on the same date, Porch announced that it had executed a definitive agreement with Covéa Cooperations S.A. to acquire GMF Financial Services Corporation (“GMF”) which owns all of the issued and outstanding stock of Civil Service Employees Insurance Company, CSE Safeguard Insurance Company, CSE Insurance Services, Inc. and CSE Group Services Company (collectively and, together with GMF, “CSE”), a California-based personal lines insurer focused on property and auto. CSE has a 71-year history and a management team put in place over the previous two years with significant home and auto experience in the state of California. CSE operates in six states, including its primary focus of California, as well as Arizona, Nevada and Utah and is licensed in an additional six states.

The closing is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval of the California Department of Insurance. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2022.
Expand into New Home Service Verticals
There are opportunities for Porch to expand organically and via acquisitions to provide software and services to additional home service verticals. Porch plans to continue to evaluate potential new home services verticals that fit within our strategy. Porch has an extensive pipeline of additional acquisition targets across the home services SaaS, insurance, moving, and home technology sectors. Management maintains active discussions with potential suitable targets.
In Q2 2021, Porch acquired Rynoh, a leading provider of patented SaaS solutions for title companies and other settlement agents. Located in Virginia, Rynoh applications help protect real estate closings by providing continuous end-to-end account auditing, daily reconciliation, transaction monitoring, fraud detection and reporting.
On October 27th, 2021 Porch completed the acquisition of Floify, a SaaS software provider to mortgage companies and loan officers that helps create a better mortgage and refinancing experience for their customers. Floify’s digital mortgage automation and point-of-sale software streamlines the loan origination process by providing a secure application, communication, and document portal between mortgage lenders, borrowers, real estate agents, and other mortgage stakeholders. Loan officers use Floify to collect and verify borrower documentation, track loan progress, communicate with borrowers and real estate agents, and close loans faster.
Geographic Expansion
Porch currently conducts the vast majority of its business in the United States and a small portion in Canada. While Porch expects to remain focused on the U.S. market for the next several years, in the future Porch may expand internationally into Europe, Australia, and other markets where the home sales market operates similarly to the U.S. Within the United States, Porch operates nationwide and has opportunity to expand is insurance operations and offerings across many U.S. markets.
Revenue
Porch generates revenue in three ways: (i) recurring SaaS fees that companies pay us for our software and services, (ii) reoccurring B2B2C transaction revenues for move-related services, and (iii) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) transaction revenues from post-move related services.
Companies which use Porch’s software and services pay Porch with SaaS fees based on a combination of per user, per organization and / or volume of transactions. In certain verticals, chiefly inspection companies have the option of receiving core software for free and giving Porch access to its customers at which time Porch generates revenue via B2B2C transactions. Because Porch gets full access to a complete base of homeowners from a company, customer access is highly attractive to Porch.
B2B2C transaction revenues for move-related services include payments related to the sale of products and services such as moving services, security, or TV/Internet service as well as revenues from Porch’s insurance and warranty businesses. Where Porch underwrites its own insurance or warranty product, revenues are recognized over the life of the policy and reoccur as long as the policyholder renews. In certain portions of business sold by EIG on behalf of third-party insurers, Porch recognizes the estimated lifetime value (“LTV”) of commissions Porch receives from insurance carriers for each new sale to a policyholder which are paid in the first year and each subsequent year that the policyholder renews.
B2B2C transaction revenues for post-move related services includes per lead, per appointment and per job fees paid by contractors and partners for customer demand.

13



Revenue for B2B2C transactions, excluding Insurance and Warranty, generally follows the seasonality of both existing home sales and home projects, with more revenue concentrated in the second and third quarters rather than the first and fourth quarters.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our software and services to companies using a variety of sales and marketing tactics. We have teams of inside sales representatives organized by vertical market who engaged directly with companies. We have enterprise sales teams which target the large named accounts in each of our vertical markets. These teams are supported by a variety of typical software marketing tactics, including both digital, in-person (such as trade shows and other events) and content marketing. Porch has been very successful at partnering with key companies in our vertical markets who have aided in sales and adoption.
For consumers, Porch largely relies on our unique and proprietary relationships with over 24,000 companies using Porch’s software to provide the company with end customer access and introductions. Porch then utilizes technology, lifecycle marketing and teams in lower cost locations to operate as a Moving Concierge to assist these consumers with services. Porch has invested in limited direct-to-consumer marketing capabilities, but expects to become more advanced over time with capabilities such as digital and social retargeting.
Technology
Porch has invested significantly for many years in engineering, product, and design in order to build out our platform. We operate a modern technology stack that allows for rapid development and deployment as well as integrations. Each of our business units develops its own technology to support its products and services, leveraging both open-source and vendor-supported software technology. Each of our various software brands and businesses has dedicated engineering teams responsible for software development and the creation of new features to support our products and services across a full range of devices (desktop, mobile web and native mobile applications). Our engineering teams use an agile development process that allows us to deploy frequent iterative product and feature releases.
Competition
The home services industry is highly competitive, fragmented, and localized. We compete with, among others: (i) search engines and online directories for all types of home services with which we assist consumers, (ii) other vertical software companies in our markets, (iii) companies who help consumers purchase insurance, moving, and other home services, and (iv) other companies which help consumers to make their homes simple. We believe that our largest competition comes from the wide variety of companies focused on reaching consumers for the purpose of helping with key high-value services such as insurance, moving, TV/Internet and other such services, as well as numerous traditional digital and non-digital service providers.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

● | the size, quality, diversity and stability of the large number of companies utilizing Porch’s software and services who give Porch early and proprietary access to homebuyers before competitors are aware;

● | our ability to increasingly engage with consumers directly through our platforms (rather than through search engine marketing or search engine referrals);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the functionality of our software and services, websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and our products and services generally to home services companies and consumers, as well as our

Intellectual Property
We regard our intellectual property rights as critical to our success generally, with our trademarks, service marks and domain names being especially critical to the continued development and awareness of our brands and our marketing efforts.
We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain name registrations, and trade secrets, as well as through contractual restrictions and reliance on federal, state and common law. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with employees, consultants, contractors and business partners, and employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment provisions.
We have several registered trademarks in the United States (including Porch, ISN, HireAHelper, Homeowners of America, and Floify brands), as well as other trademarks in Canada and Europe. We have also registered a variety of domain names, including those related to our consumer and other key brands.
Government Regulation
We are subject to laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet generally and through mobile applications, including laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for their operations and the activities of their users. As a result, we could be subject to claims based on negligence, unfair business practices, various torts and trademark and copyright infringement, among other actions.
In addition, because we receive, transmit, store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by consumers and service professionals, we are also impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy, the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data and data breaches.


We are particularly sensitive to laws and regulations that adversely impact the popularity or growth in the use of the Internet and/or online products and services generally, restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide our products and services, regulate the practices of third parties upon which we rely to provide our products and services and undermine open and neutrally administered Internet access. To the extent our businesses are required to implement new measures and/or make changes to our products and services to ensure compliance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Compliance with this legislation or similar or more stringent legislation in other jurisdictions could be costly, and the failure to comply could result in service interruptions and negative publicity, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in December 2017, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission adopted an order reversing net neutrality protections in the United States, including the repeal of specific rules against blocking, throttling or “paid prioritization” of content or services by Internet service providers. To the extent Internet service providers take such actions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We are also subject to laws governing marketing and advertising activities conducted by/through telephone, e-mail, mobile devices and the Internet, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”), the Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”), the CAN-SPAM Act, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and similar state laws, as well as federal, state, and local laws and agency guidelines governing background screening.

Additionally, as we expand into the insurance business, which is highly regulated, we must comply with and maintain various licenses and approvals with a number of individual state departments of insurance, and we are subject to state governmental regulation and supervision. 
Further, we are subject to certain laws and regulations with regard to the real estate settlement process, including the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which, among other matters, prohibits certain practices, such as kickbacks, referrals, and unearned fees for the referral of real estate settlement services.
Human Capital Management
Our core values are foundational to Porch. By staying true to: No Jerks/No Egos; Solve Each Problem; Be Ambitious; Care Deeply; and Together We Win, we have created a company where good people can do great work and drive shareholder value. These values guide us in everything we do, from individual everyday tasks to high-level strategic planning. They foster a culture of dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family that contributes to our long-term success.
Porch is organized as a decentralized operating model, which we believe allows our businesses to move quickly and entrepreneurially with a common playbook and infrastructure that benefit from shared best practices as we scale. When we acquire a company, our decentralized operating model helps us manage the costs and mitigate the risks associated with integration. We integrate acquisitions into our (1) central data platform; (2) transactional monetization to drive our B2B2C revenues such as insurance; and (3) key back-end systems such as accounting. 
We engage and empower our team with continued career and learning and development opportunities. Fostering a growth mindset facilitates a culture where all voices are heard and team members can take informed risks, ask questions, and seek creative solutions to tough problems. This approach helps us build a strong bench of leaders for tomorrow’s business challenges.
Our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are based on the principle that all Porch team members can bring their whole selves to work and thrive. We have a growing Employee Resource Group (ERG) community and a commitment throughout the organization for Porch to be a supportive and inclusive environment.
As of January 2022, Porch had approximately 1,700 full-time employees and independent contractors. We believe that we generally have good relationships with our employees and contractors.
