(dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)
 
General 
 
Bassett is a leading retailer, manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings. Our products are sold primarily through a network of Company-owned and licensee-owned branded stores under the Bassett Home Furnishings (“BHF”) name, with additional distribution through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers. We also sell our products through our website at www.bassettfurniture.com. We were founded in 1902 and incorporated under the laws of Virginia in 1930. Our rich 119-year history has instilled the principles of quality, value, and integrity in everything we do, while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever-changing consumer tastes and meet the demands of a global economy.
 
With 97 BHF stores at November 27, 2021, we have leveraged our strong brand name in furniture into a network of Company-owned and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories.  Our store program is designed to provide a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish, quality furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service.  In order to reach markets that cannot be effectively served by our retail store network, we also distribute our products, including the Lane Venture outdoor furniture products, through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers. We use a network of over 30 independent sales representatives who have stated geographical territories. These sales representatives are compensated based on a standard commission rate. We believe this blended strategy provides us the greatest ability to effectively distribute our products throughout the United States and ultimately gain market share.  
 
The BHF stores feature custom order furniture, free in-home and virtual design visits (“home makeovers”) and coordinated decorating accessories.  Our philosophy is based on building strong long-term relationships with each customer.  Sales people are referred to as “Design Consultants” and are trained to evaluate customer needs and provide comprehensive solutions for their home decor.  Until a rigorous training and design certification program is completed, Design Consultants are not authorized to perform in-home or virtual design services for our customers.
 
We have factories in Newton, North Carolina that manufacture Bench Made custom upholstered and outdoor furniture. We also have factories in Martinsville and Bassett, Virginia that assemble and finish our custom dining offerings, including our Bench Made line of solid hardwood furniture. We currently lease a facility in Haleyville, Alabama where we manufacture aluminum frames for our outdoor furniture. Our manufacturing team takes great pride in the breadth of its options, the precision of its craftsmanship, and the speed of its manufacturing process. Our logistics team then ships the product to one of our home delivery hubs or to a location specified by our licensees.  In addition to the furniture that we manufacture domestically, we source most of our formal bedroom and dining room furniture (casegoods) and certain leather upholstery offerings from several foreign plants, primarily in Vietnam, Thailand and China. Over 75% of the products we currently sell are manufactured in the United States.
 
During fiscal 2018 we acquired Lane Venture, a manufacturer and distributor of premium outdoor furniture and is operated as a component of our wholesale segment. This acquisition marked our entry into the market for outdoor furniture and we believe that Lane Venture has provided a foundation for us to become a significant participant in this category. Our strategy is to distribute this brand outside of our BHF store network only.
 
With the knowledge we have gained through operating Lane Venture, we have developed the Bassett Outdoor brand that is only marketed through the BHF store network. This allows Bassett branded product to move from inside the home to outside the home to capitalize on the growing trend of outdoor living.
 
We also own Zenith Freight Lines, LLC (“Zenith”) which provides logistical services to Bassett along with other furniture manufacturers and retailers. Zenith delivers best-of-class shipping and logistical support services that are uniquely tailored to the needs of Bassett and the furniture industry. Over 60% of Zenith’s revenue is generated from services provided to non-Bassett customers.
 
Ongoing Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Related Supply Chain and Labor Issues Upon Our Business
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States, federal, state and local governments throughout the country imposed varying degrees of restrictions on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. These measures had a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the economy, including non-essential retail commerce, beginning in our second fiscal quarter of 2020.
 
    2 

  

In response to the above and for the protection of our employees and customers, we temporarily closed our dedicated BHF stores, our manufacturing locations and many of our warehouses for several weeks primarily during the second fiscal quarter of 2020. The disruption to our operations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant loss for the year ended November 28, 2020. By the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we had reopened all stores and resumed manufacturing activity, allowing us to return to profitability beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and continuing through fiscal 2021.
 
Since restarting our manufacturing operations and reopening stores, the pace of incoming wholesale orders from both the retail stores and our independent dealers outside the BHF store network have far exceeded our post reopening forecasts. Wholesale orders for fiscal 2021 increased 29% as compared to 2020. In addition, wholesale orders for fiscal 2021 represented a 28% increase as compared to pre-pandemic levels of fiscal 2019. However, various supply chain disruptions and logistical challenges have created significant delays in order fulfillment resulting in abnormally high backlogs. In addition, inflationary pressures throughout the supply chain have resulted in us implementing multiple wholesale price increases over the last several months. We expect that wholesale gross margins will be slightly impacted during the first half of fiscal 2022 as we cycle through the backlog.
 
To address our growing backlog, in fiscal 2021 we opened another upholstery manufacturing facility in Newton, NC, adjacent to our existing 500,000 square foot complex. Production from this additional 123,000 square foot facility began in early June and is dedicated to our opening price point “Everyday Value” product. The added space will also allow us to expand our Bench Made motion program, previously referred to as Magnificent Motion, that has exceeded our sales projections since its debut in early 2020.
 
We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its lingering impact on the economy, the consumer and our business. While the rate of incoming orders at both our wholesale and retail segments remains strong, there are continuing logistical challenges faced by us and the entire home furnishings industry resulting from COVID-related labor shortages and supply chain disruptions creating significant delays in order fulfillment and increasing backlogs. Although unable to predict with certainty, we expect gradual decreases in wholesale and retail backlogs over the course of fiscal 2022 driven by an anticipated lower rate of future incoming orders coupled with increased manufacturing and shipping activity. Whereas the progress in mass vaccination programs in the U.S. has prompted state and local governments to substantially lift most remaining restrictions on commercial retail activity, it is nevertheless possible that the recent resurgence in COVID-19 cases due to the Delta and Omicron variants, as well as any future variants of the coronavirus entering the U.S., could prompt a return to tighter restrictions in certain areas of the country. Furthermore, pandemic-related labor shortages and supply chain disruptions remain unresolved and order cancellations could result if the present delays in order fulfillment continue for an extended period of time. Therefore, uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon our financial condition and future results of operations.
 
Operating Segments 
 
We have strategically aligned our business into three reportable segments: Wholesale, Retail – Company-owned stores, and Logistical Services.
 
The wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design, manufacture, sourcing, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of BHF stores (Company-owned retail stores and licensee-owned stores) and independent furniture retailers. Our retail segment consists of 63 Company-owned and operated BHF stores. The following table shows the number of Company-owned stores by state as of November 27, 2021:

 | Number of | | Number of
--------------+-----------+----------------+----------
State | Stores | State | Stores 
Alabama | 1 | Missouri | 1 
Arizona | 3 | Nevada | 1 
Arkansas | 1 | New Jersey | 2 
California | 3 | New York | 6 
Connecticut | 3 | North Carolina | 5 
Delaware | 1 | Ohio | 2 
Florida | 4 | Oklahoma | 1 
Georgia | 3 | Pennsylvania | 2 
Kansas | 1 | South Carolina | 1 
Kentucky | 1 | Tennessee | 1 
Maryland | 3 | Texas | 12 
Massachusetts | 1 | Virginia | 4 
 | | Total | 63 

 
    3 

  

Our six locations in the state of New York include a 16,000 square foot clearance center in Middletown, New York. Unlike our other 62 BHF locations, the clearance center offers only clearance merchandise at reduced price points and without design consulting services.
 
Wholesale Segment Overview
 
The wholesale furniture industry is very competitive and there are a large number of manufacturers both within and outside the United States who compete in the market on the basis of product quality, price, style, delivery and service. Additionally, many retailers source imported product directly, thus bypassing domestic furniture manufacturers and wholesale importers. We believe that we can be successful in the current competitive environment because our products represent excellent value combining attractive prices, quality and styling, prompt delivery, and superior service.
 
Wholesale shipments by category for the last three fiscal years, excluding intercompany sales to our retail segment, are summarized below:
 

 | 2021 | | 2020 | | | 2019 
--------------------------+----------+---------+--------------+---+---------+------
 | External | | Intercompany | | | Total | | External | Intercompany | | | Total | | | External | | Intercompany | Total | 
Bassett Custom Upholstery | $ | 105,445 | | $ | 69,533 | | $ | 174,978 | | 59.2 | % | | $ | 71,840 | | $ | 56,360 | $ | 128,200 | 58.0 | % | $ | 78,856 | $ | 73,559 | $ | 152,415 | 58.4 | %

Bassett Casegoods | | 17,378 | | | 18,610 | | | 35,988 | | 12.2 | % | | | 13,719 | | | 18,409 | | 32,128 | 14.5 | % | | 17,221 | | 23,699 | | 40,920 | 15.7 | %
Accessories (1) | | - | | | - | | | - | | 0.0 | % | | | - | | | - | | - | 0.0 | % | | 748 | | 1,720 | | 2,468 | 0.9 | %

(1) | Beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2019, our wholesale segment no longer purchases accessory items for resale to our retail segment or to third party customers such as licensees or independent furniture retailers. Our retail segment and third party customers now source their accessory items directly from the accessory vendors.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Approximately 24% of our 2021 wholesale sales were of imported product compared to 24% and 23% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We define imported product as fully finished product that is sourced. Our domestic product includes certain products that contain components which were also sourced. We continue to believe that a blended strategy including domestically produced products primarily of a custom-order nature combined with sourcing of major collections provides the best value and quality of products to our customers.
 
The dollar value of our wholesale backlog, representing orders received but not yet shipped to the BHF store network or independent dealers, was $90,057 at November 27, 2021 and $54,874 at November 28, 2020. We believe that the backlog will gradually decrease over the course of 2022 to a more manageable level as supply chain constraints begin to ease and because we do not believe the pace of business experienced in late fiscal 2020 through most of fiscal 2021 is sustainable.
 
We use lumber, fabric, leather, foam and other materials in the production of wood and upholstered furniture. These components are purchased from a variety of domestic and international suppliers and are widely available. The price and availability of foam, which is highly dependent on the cost of oil and available capacity of oil refineries, can be subject to significant volatility from time to time. We currently assemble and finish these components in our five manufacturing facilities in the United States.
 
Retail Segment Overview – Company-Owned Retail Stores
 
The retail furniture industry remains very competitive and includes local furniture stores, regional furniture retailers, national department and chain stores, single-vendor branded retailers and on-line retailers. As a whole, our store network with 63 Company-owned stores and 34 licensee-owned stores, ranks in the top 30 in retail furniture sales in the United States. Our Company-owned store network peaked at 70 stores in fiscal 2019. Since that time, we have closed seven underperforming locations.

----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The COVID crisis has given us the opportunity to look inward and to make structural improvements to our business model. We instituted a “virtual appointment” program for our stores in late March of 2020, whereby consumers digitally engage with our designers and transact without physically visiting a store. Adding this new form of engagement is one of the many lasting changes that have come out of the pandemic.
 
We consider our website to be the front door to our brand experience where customers can research our furniture and accessory offerings and subsequently buy online or engage with an in-store design consultant. Customer acquisition resulting from our digital outreach strategies has significantly increased our traffic to the website and our online orders over the last two years. While the growth in website traffic and orders moderated somewhat in fiscal 2021 compared to 2020, both have nearly doubled since 2019. Digital advertising dominated our marketing expenditures for the majority of the year as we chose to spend less on traditional television and direct mail advertising. We plan to continue with increased levels of spending on digital advertising and outreach during 2022.
 
The migration to digital brand research has caused us to comprehensively evaluate all of our American made custom products. While our Custom Upholstery, Custom Dining, and Bench Made product lines continue to be our most successful offerings, most of these items must be purchased in a store as they are not conducive to web transactions due to the number of options available. Consequently, we will continue to methodically re-design each one of these important lines. Our intent is to continue to offer the consumer custom options that will help them personalize their home but to do so in an edited fashion that will provide a better web experience in the research phase and will also allow the final purchase to be made either on the web or in the store. While we work to make it easier to purchase either in store or on-line, we will not compromise on our in-store experience or the quality of our in-home makeover capabilities.
 
We also continue to re-examine the performance of every one of our stores. Store traffic has been declining for three years and the effect on our retail model has become increasingly challenging. We believe that on a market-by-market basis, there will be fewer stores in the future. We will continue to evaluate store-by-store performance as we seek the optimal store count in the markets in which we compete at retail.
 
We also plan to heavily emphasize our “Made in America” story and utilize locally harvested and organic materials when possible. As part of this, we recently rebranded our premier Custom Upholstery line to be part of the Bench Made program emphasizing that those products are artisan crafted with exceptional domestic materials and are made to order. In addition, we expanded our Bench Made solid wood dining offerings to provide a sleeker more contemporary styling product to complement our initial Bench Made dining offerings.

Logistical Services Segment Overview
 
Zenith is a specialized supply chain solutions provider, offering the home furnishings industry the benefit of an asset-based network to move product with greater efficiency, enhanced speed to market, less damage and a single source of shipment visibility. We provide fully integrated solutions with the highest commitment to customer care and service as we seek to go beyond our customers’ transactional expectations to create collaborative partnerships that provide a single source network to:

● | Better manage inventory across multiple locations and provide total audit-ready accountability
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduce line haul and delivery costs
--+------------------------------------


● | Ensure availability of high-volume items in stores
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Integrate the omnichannel nature of today’s retail supply chain
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Management and predictability of the total landed cost of goods
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our customer solutions are provided through the following services:
 

● | Network line haul freight (middle mile)
--+----------------------------------------


● | Warehousing, distribution and inventory management
--+---------------------------------------------------

 
At November 27, 2021, our shipping and delivery fleet consisted of the following:
 

 | Owned | | Leased | | Total
----------------------+-------+-----+--------+-----+------
Tractors | | 125 | | 110 | | 235
Trailers | | 318 | | 360 | | 678
Local delivery trucks | | 7 | | 22 | | 29 

 
We own a central warehousing and national distribution hub located in Conover, North Carolina, and we lease fourteen facilities in ten states across the continental United States from which we operate regional freight terminals and provide warehouse and distribution services.
 
Recent Development Regarding Zenith
 
On January 31, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of Zenith Freight Lines, LLC to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. for approximately $87,000 in cash. We expect the transaction to close by February 28, 2022 subject to customary closing conditions.
Trademarks 
 
Our trademarks, including “Bassett” and the names of some of our marketing divisions, products and collections, are significant to the conduct of our business. This is important due to consumer recognition of the names and identification with our broad range of products. Certain of our trademarks are licensed to independent retailers for use in full store and store gallery presentations of our products. We also own copyrights that are important in the conduct of our business.
Government Regulations 
 
We believe that we have materially complied with all federal, state and local standards regarding safety, health and pollution and environmental controls.
 
Our logistical services segment is also subject to regulation by several federal governmental agencies, including the Department of Transportation (“DOT”). Specifically the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the Surface Transportation Board, which are agencies within the DOT. We are also subject to rules and regulations of various state agencies. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers and other matters.
 
We may also be affected by laws and regulations of countries from which we source goods. Labor, environmental and other laws and regulations change over time, especially in the developing countries from which we source. Changes in these areas of regulation could negatively impact the cost and availability of sourced goods. The timing and extent to which these regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations is difficult to predict. In addition, the imposition of new or increased duties, tariffs, retaliatory tariffs and trade limitations with respect to foreign-sourced products could negatively impact the cost of such goods. Based on the present facts, we do not believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations.

Human Capital 
 
We employed 2,219 people as of November 27, 2021. Our associate count represents an increase of 202 from a year ago, which can be attributed to increased production capacity at our upholstery facilities and the restoration of COVID-19 related headcount reductions in our logistical services segment. Headcount by segment is as follows:

● | 1,034 in the wholesale segment
--+-------------------------------


● | 541 in the retail segment
--+--------------------------


● | 644 in the logistical services segment
--+---------------------------------------

We continue to maintain and enforce our policy prohibiting discrimination and harassment in our workplace. Our managers are trained in how to prevent, recognize and respond to possible inappropriate behavior. Associates have several available avenues for reporting concerns, including a confidential hotline. We promptly and carefully investigate each complaint of harassment or discrimination.
Major Customers
 
Our risk exposure related to our customers, consisting primarily of trade accounts receivable along with certain guarantees, net of recognized reserves, totaled approximately $30,048 and $24,476 at November 27, 2021 and November 28, 2020, respectively. At November 27, 2021 and November 28, 2020, approximately 22% and 24%, respectively, of the aggregate risk exposure, net of reserves, was attributable to five customers. In fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated net sales. However, two customers accounted for approximately 23%, 29% and 44% of our consolidated revenue from logistical services during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
