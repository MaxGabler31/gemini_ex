Item 1.        Business
Altice USA, Inc. ("Altice USA" or the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware on September 14, 2015. As of December 31, 2017, Altice USA was majority‑owned by Altice N.V., a public company with limited liability (naamloze vennootshcap) under Dutch law ("Altice N.V." and Altice N.V. and its subsidiaries, the "Altice Group"). Upon the completion of the Altice N.V. distribution discussed below, the Company will no longer be majority-owned by Altice N.V.
Altice USA is one of the largest broadband communications and video services providers in the United States. We deliver broadband, pay television, telephony services, proprietary content and advertising services to approximately 4.9 million residential and business customers. Our footprint extends across 21 states through a fiber-rich broadband network with more than 8.6 million homes passed as of December 31, 2017. 
        We acquired Cequel Corporation ("Suddenlink" or "Cequel") on December 21, 2015 and Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Optimum" or "Cablevision") on June 21, 2016. These acquisitions are referred to throughout this document as the "Suddenlink Acquisition" (or the "Cequel Acquisition") and the "Optimum Acquisition (or the "Cablevision Acquisition"), respectively, and collectively as the "Acquisitions." We are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. We serve our customers through two business segments: Optimum, which operates in the New York metropolitan area, and Suddenlink, which principally operates in markets in the south-central United States.
Following the Acquisitions, we began to simplify our organizational structure, reduce management layers, streamline decision-making processes and redeploy resources with a focus on network investment, customer service enhancements and marketing support. As a result, we have made significant progress in integrating the operations of Optimum and Suddenlink, centralizing our business functions, reorganizing our procurement processes, eliminating duplicative management functions, terminating lower-return projects and non-essential consulting and third-party service arrangements, and investing in our employee relations and our culture. Improved operational efficiency has allowed us to redeploy physical, technical and financial resources towards upgrading our network and enhancing the customer experience to drive customer growth. This focus is demonstrated by reduced network outages since the Acquisitions, which we believe improves the consistency and quality of the customer experience. In addition, we have expanded, and intend to continue expanding, our e-commerce channels for sales and marketing.
        Since the Acquisitions, we have quadrupled the maximum available broadband speeds we are offering to our Optimum customers from 101 Mbps to 400 Mbps for residential customers and 450 Mbps for business customers and expanded our 1 Gbps broadband service to approximately 72% of our Suddenlink footprint from approximately 40% prior to the Suddenlink Acquisition. In addition, we have commenced a plan to build a fiber-to-the-home ("FTTH") network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We believe this FTTH network will be more resilient with reduced maintenance requirements, fewer service outages and lower power usage, which we expect will drive further cost efficiencies in our business. In order to further enhance the customer experience, during the fourth quarter, we introduced a new home communications hub, Altice One, and we have begun rolling it out across our Optimum footprint. Our new home communications hub is an innovative, integrated platform with a dynamic and sophisticated user interface, combining a set-top box, Internet wireless router and cable modem in one device, and is our most advanced home communications hub. We are also beginning to offer managed data and communications services to our business customers and more advanced advertising services, such as targeted multi-screen advertising and data analytics, to our advertising and other business clients. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we and Sprint Corporation ("Sprint") entered into a multi-year strategic agreement pursuant to which we will utilize Sprint's network to provide mobile voice and data services to our customers throughout the nation, and our broadband network will be utilized to accelerate the densification of Sprint's network. We believe this additional product offering will enable us to deliver greater value and more benefits to our customers.

Altice N.V. Distribution
On January 8, 2018, Altice N.V. announced plans for the separation of the Company from Altice N.V. Altice N.V. will distribute substantially all of its equity interest in the Company through a distribution in kind to holders of Altice N.V.'s common shares A and common shares B (the “Distribution”). Following the Distribution, Altice N.V. will no longer own a controlling equity interest in the Company, and the Company will operate independently from Altice N.V. Altice N.V. is ultimately controlled by Patrick Drahi through Next Alt S.a.r.l. (‘‘Next Alt’’). As of December 31, 2017, Next Alt held 60.31% of the outstanding share capital and voting rights of Altice N.V., representing 49.5% of the economic rights and 66% of the voting power in general meetings. Mr. Drahi has informed us that Next Alt will elect to receive 100% of the shares of Altice USA to which it is entitled in the Distribution in the form of Altice USA Class B common stock and will be subject to proration, in the same manner as other Altice N.V. shareholders, in the event the number of shares of Altice USA Class B common stock elected to be received by Altice N.V. shareholders exceeds a cap of 247.7 million shares (the "Class B Cap"). As a result of Next Alt’s intended election, and voting agreements that Next Alt will enter into with certain members of Altice N.V. and Altice USA management with respect to all shares of Altice USA common stock they own, Mr. Drahi will control Altice USA immediately after giving effect to the Distribution regardless of the elections made by other Altice N.V. shareholders.
The implementation of the Distribution is expected to be subject to certain conditions precedent being satisfied or waived. Although Altice N.V. and the Company have not yet negotiated the final terms of the Distribution and related transactions, the Company expects that the following will be conditions to the Distribution: 

• | Approval of Altice N.V. shareholders of (i) the distribution in kind and (ii) the board resolution approving the change in identity and character of the business of Altice N.V. resulting from the Distribution;


• | Receipt of certain U.S. regulatory approvals, which could take up to 180 days;


• | The Registration Statement filed on January 8, 2018, as amended, being declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’);

3


• | The entry into a separation agreement (the "Master Separation Agreement") and the entry into, amendments to or termination of various arrangements between Altice N.V. and the Company, such as a license to use the Altice brand, the stockholders’ agreement among Altice USA, Altice N.V. and certain other parties and the management agreement pursuant to which the Company pays a quarterly management fee to Altice N.V.; and


• | The declaration and payment of a one-time $1.5 billion dividend to Altice USA stockholders as of a record date prior to the Distribution (the ‘‘Pre-Distribution Dividend’’).

Prior to Altice N.V.'s announcement of the Distribution, the Board of Directors of Altice USA, acting through its independent directors, approved in principle the payment of the Pre-Distribution Dividend to all shareholders immediately prior to completion of the separation. Formal approval of the Pre-Distribution Dividend and setting of a record date are expected to occur in the second quarter of 2018. The payment of the Pre-Distribution Dividend will be funded with available Cablevision revolving facility capacity and available cash from new financings, completed in January 2018, at CSC Holdings LLC ("CSC Holdings"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision. In addition, the Board of Directors of Altice USA has authorized a share repurchase program of $2.0 billion, effective following completion of the separation.
Our Products and Services
       We provide broadband, pay television and telephony services to both residential and business customers. We also provide enterprise-grade fiber connectivity, bandwidth and managed services to enterprise customers through Optimum’s Lightpath business (also marketed as Altice Business) and advertising time to advertisers.
The prices we charge for our services vary based on the number of services and associated service level or tier our customers choose, coupled with any promotions we may offer. As part of our marketing strategy our customers are increasingly choosing to bundle their subscriptions to two (‘‘double product’’) or three (‘‘triple product’’) of our services at the same time. Customers who subscribe to a bundle generally receive a discount from the price of buying each of these services separately, as well as the convenience of receiving multiple services from a single provider, all on a single monthly bill. For example, we offer an ‘‘Optimum Triple Play’’ package that is a special promotion for new customers or eligible current customers where Optimum broadband, pay television and telephony services are each available at a reduced rate for a specified period when purchased together. Approximately 50% of our residential customers were triple product customers as of December 31, 2017.
Residential Services
       We offer broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential customers through both our Optimum and Suddenlink segments. The following tables show our residential customer relationships and revenues by service offerings for each of our Optimum and Suddenlink segments as well as on a combined basis.

Broadband Services
        We offer a variety of broadband service tiers tailored to meet the different needs of our residential customers. Current customer offers include four tiers with download speeds ranging from 60 Mbps to 400 Mbps for our Optimum residential customers and 50 Mbps to 1 Gbps for our Suddenlink residential customers. Our broadband services also include the Optimum wireless router, as well as Internet security software, including anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewall and anti-spam protection. Substantially all of our hybrid fiber-coaxial ("HFC") network is digital and data over cable service interface specification ("DOCSIS") 3.0 compatible, with approximately 275 homes per node and a bandwidth capacity of at least 750 MHz throughout. This network allows us to provide our customers with advanced broadband, pay television and telephony services. Since the Acquisitions, we have quadrupled the maximum available broadband speeds we are offering to our Optimum customers from 101 Mbps to 400 Mbps for residential customers and 450 Mbps for business customers and expanded our 1 Gbps broadband service to approximately 72% of our Suddenlink footprint from approximately 40% prior to the Suddenlink Acquisition. We have also commenced a plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint.
        In addition, we have deployed Wi-Fi across our Optimum service area with approximately 2.1 million Wi-Fi hotspots as of December 31, 2017. The Optimum Wi-Fi network allows Optimum broadband customers to access the service while they are away from their home or office. Wi-Fi is delivered via wireless access points mounted on our Optimum broadband network, in certain retail partner locations, certain NJ Transit rail stations, New York City parks and other public venues. Similarly, our "Optimum wireless router" product includes a second network that enables all Optimum broadband customers to access the Optimum Wi-Fi network. Access to the Optimum Wi-Fi network is offered as a free value-added benefit to Optimum broadband customers and for a fee to non-customers in certain locations. Our Wi-Fi service also allows our Optimum broadband customers to access the Wi-Fi networks of Comcast Corporation ("Comcast"), Charter Communications, Inc. ("Charter")(within the legacy Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks footprints) and Cox Communications. Through these relationships we offer our Optimum customers access to approximately 350,000 additional hotspots nationwide.
Pay Television Services
        We currently offer a variety of pay television services, which include delivery of broadcast stations and cable networks, and advanced digital pay television services, such as video-on-demand ("VOD"), high-definition ("HD") channels, digital video recorder ("DVR") and pay-per-view, to our residential markets. Depending on the market and level of service, our pay television services include, among other programming, local broadcast networks and independent television stations, news, information, sports and entertainment channels, regional sports networks, international channels and premium services such as HBO, Showtime, Cinemax and The Movie Channel. Our residential customers pay a monthly charge based on the pay television programming level of service, tier or package they receive and the type of equipment they select. Customers who subscribe to seasonal sports packages, international channels and premium services may be charged an additional monthly amount. We may also charge additional fees for pay-per-view programming, DVR and certain VOD services.
        As of December 31, 2017, Optimum residential customers were able to receive up to 605 digital channels and Suddenlink residential customers were able to receive up to 438 digital channels depending on their market and level of service. Optimum offers up to 174 HD channels and Suddenlink offers up to 139 HD channels, which represent the most widely watched programming, including all major broadcast networks, as well as most leading national cable networks, premium channels and regional sports networks. HDTV features high-resolution picture quality, digital sound quality and a wide-screen, theater-like display when using an HDTV set and an HD-capable converter. We also continue to launch additional HD channels to continuously improve our customer's viewing experience. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 95% of our residential Optimum pay television customers subscribe to HDTV services. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 81% of Suddenlink pay television customers were digital pay television customers and approximately 95% of those digital pay television customers subscribe to HDTV services.
        We also provide advanced services, such as pay-per-view and VOD, that give residential pay television customers control over when they watch their favorite programming. Our pay-per-view service allows customers to pay to view single showings of programming on an unedited, commercial-free basis, including feature films, live sporting events, 
5

concerts and other special events. Our VOD service provides on-demand access to movies, special events, free prime time content and general interest titles. Subscription-based VOD premium content such as HBO and Showtime is made available to customers who subscribe to one of our premium programming packages. Our customers have the ability to start the programs at whatever time is convenient, as well as pause, rewind and (for most content) fast forward both standard definition and HD VOD programming. As of December 31, 2017, pay-per-view services were available for all Optimum and 99% of Suddenlink pay television customers and VOD services were available to all of our Optimum pay television customers and 95% of our Suddenlink pay television customers, and we offered thousands of HD titles on-demand for Optimum and Suddenlink customers, respectively.
        For a monthly fee, we offer DVR services through the use of digital converters, the majority of which are HDTV-capable and have video recording capability. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 50% of our residential Optimum pay television customers and 37% of our Suddenlink pay television customers utilized DVR services. Optimum customers can choose either a set-top box DVR with the ability to record, pause and rewind live television or the Cloud DVR Plus with remote-storage capability to record 15 shows simultaneously while watching any live or pre-recorded show, and pause and rewind live television. Depending on the market, Suddenlink customers have the option to use a set-top box DVR or a TiVo HD/DVR converter, which delivers multi-room DVR capability using TiVo Mini devices that allow customers to pause and rewind live television, manage recordings from different television locations and play them back throughout the home. In addition, TiVo Stream service, which allows customers to stream live television channels and recorded programming wirelessly throughout their home to Android and iOS devices, and, subject to copyright restrictions, download previously recorded content to these devices so that it can be viewed outside the home, is provided to current TiVo DVR customers.
        We also introduced a new home communications and entertainment hub during the fourth quarter of 2017, Altice One, which is our most advanced home hub, and we have begun rolling it out across our Optimum footprint. This new hub is an innovative, integrated platform with a dynamic and sophisticated user interface, combining a set-top box, Internet wireless router and cable modem in one device. It is based on LaBox, which Altice N.V. has successfully deployed in France, the Dominican Republic and Israel, and is initially offered to new customers subscribing to our double and triple-product packages. It is capable of delivering broadband Internet, Wi-Fi, digital television services, over-the-top ("OTT") services and fixed-line telephony and supports 4K video and a remote-storage DVR with the capacity to record 15 television programs simultaneously and the ability to rewind live television on the last two channels watched. Additional features include a point-anywhere voice-command remote control and a companion mobile app that allows viewing of all television content including DVR streaming. Additional televisions will be paired with "minis," which can also act as Wi-Fi extenders for an advanced Wi-Fi experience throughout the home. 
        We also offer alternative viewing platforms for our pay television programming through mobile applications. Our Optimum customers have access to Optimum App, available for the iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, personal computers, Kindle Fire and select Android phones and tablets, and our Suddenlink customers have access to Suddenlink2GO, available for personal computers and select phones and tablets. Depending on the platform, the Optimum App features include the ability to watch live television, stream on-demand titles from various networks and use the device as a remote to control the customer's digital set-top box while inside the home. Suddenlink2GO enables Suddenlink customers to watch over 300,000 movies, shows and clips from over 200 networks on a personal computer once authenticated via the Suddenlink customer portal and select television shows and movies on their mobile devices.
Telephony Services
        Through voice over Internet protocol ("VoIP") telephone service we also offer unlimited local, regional and long-distance calling within the United States, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and Canada for a flat monthly rate, including popular calling features such as caller ID with name and number, call waiting, three-way calling, enhanced emergency 911 dialing and television caller ID. We also offer additional options designed to meet our customers' needs, including directory assistance, voicemail services and international calling. Discount and promotional pricing are available when our telephony services are combined with our other service offerings.
Mobile
        In the fourth quarter of 2017, we and Sprint entered into a multi-year strategic agreement pursuant to which we will utilize Sprint's network to provide mobile voice and data services to our customers throughout the nation, and our broadband network will be utilized to accelerate the densification of Sprint's network. We believe this additional product 
6

offering will enable us to deliver greater value and more benefits to our customers, including by offering "quad play" offerings that bundle broadband, pay television, telephony and mobile voice and data services to our customers.
Business Services
        Both our Optimum and Suddenlink segments offer a wide and growing variety of products and services to both large enterprise and small and medium-sized business ("SMB") customers, including broadband, telephony, networking and pay television services. For the year ended December 31, 2017, business services accounted for approximately 14% of the revenue for both our Optimum and Suddenlink segments, respectively, and accounted for approximately 14% of our consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2017, our Optimum segment served approximately 263,000 SMB customers and our Suddenlink segment served 109,000 SMB customers. We serve enterprise customers primarily through our Lightpath business, a subsidiary of Cablevision.
Enterprise Customers
        Lightpath provides Ethernet, data transport, IP-based virtual private networks, Internet access, telephony services, including session initiated protocol ("SIP") trunking and VoIP services to the business market. Our Lightpath bandwidth connectivity service offers download speeds up to 100 Gbps. Lightpath also provides managed services to businesses, including hosted telephony services (cloud based SIP-based private branch exchange), managed Wi-Fi, managed desktop and server backup and managed collaboration services including audio and web conferencing. Through Lightpath, we also offer fiber-to-the-tower ("FTTT") services to wireless carriers for cell tower backhaul and enable wireline communications service providers to connect to customers that their own networks do not reach. Lightpath's customers include companies in health care, financial, education, legal and professional services, and other industries, as well as the public sector and communication providers, incumbent local exchange carriers ("ILEC"), and competitive local exchange carriers ("CLEC"). As of December 31, 2017, Lightpath had over 9,100 locations connected to its fiber network. Our Lightpath advanced fiber optic network extends more than 7,100 route miles, which includes approximately 361,000 miles of fiber, throughout the New York metropolitan area.
        For enterprise and larger commercial customers, Suddenlink offers high capacity data services, including wide area networking and dedicated data access and advanced services such as wireless mesh networks. Suddenlink also offers enterprise class telephone services which include traditional multi-line phone service over DOCSIS and trunking solutions via SIP for our Primary Rate Interface and SIP trunking applications. Similar to Lightpath, Suddenlink also offers FTTT services. These Suddenlink services are offered on a standalone basis or in bundles that are developed specifically for our commercial customers.
SMB Customers
        Both our Optimum and Suddenlink segments provide broadband, pay television and telephony services to SMB customers. In addition to these services, we also offer managed services, including business e-mail, hosted private branch exchange, web space storage and network security monitoring for SMB customers. We also offer Optimum Voice for Business, providing for up to 24 voice lines for SMB customers and 20 business calling features at no additional charge. Optimum Voice for Business offers business trunking services with support for application programming interfaces. Optional add-on services, such as international calling, toll free calling and virtual receptionists, are also available for business customers.
Advertising Sales
        As part of the agreements under which we acquire pay television programming, we typically receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time during such programming, generally two minutes per hour, into which our systems can insert commercials, subject, in some instances, to certain subject matter limitations. Our advertising sales infrastructure includes in-house production facilities, production and administrative employees and a locally-based sales force, and is part of Altice Media Solutions ("AMS"), the advertising sales division of Altice USA.
        AMS offers data-driven television, digital and other multi-platform advertising to clients ranging from Fortune 500 brands to local businesses. AMS provides national and local businesses with television and digital advertising opportunities targeted within specific geographies, including in New York City, and throughout the Suddenlink footprint. AMS offers clients opportunities to use interactive television products to reach their customers and provide a deeper level of audience engagement.
7

        In several of the markets in which we operate, we have entered into agreements commonly referred to as interconnects with other cable operators to jointly sell local advertising, simplifying our clients' purchase of local advertising and expanding their geographic reach. In some of these markets, we represent the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators; in other markets, other cable operators represent us. For instance, AMS manages the New York Interconnect, a partnership between AMS and Comcast that provides national brands with television and digital advertising opportunities over a broader portion of the New York designated market area ("DMA") than AMS's local offerings. The New York Interconnect is the largest interconnect in the country, with a footprint of over 3.2 million households. In the larger DMAs in the Suddenlink footprint, we participate in a number of interconnects managed by others, such as the Houston and Dallas interconnects. In December 2017, Altice USA, Charter Communications and Comcast announced a preliminary agreement to form a new Interconnect in the New York market that would provide a single solution to reach more than 6.2 million households across the New York DMA. The new New York Interconnect is expected to launch in early second quarter 2018.
        For the year ended December 31, 2017, advertising sales accounted for approximately 5% and 3% of the revenue for our Optimum and Suddenlink segments, respectively, and accounted for approximately 4% of our consolidated revenue.
Data Analytics
        The Advanced Data Analytics business, which was launched by Optimum in 2013, provides data-driven, audience-based advertising solutions to the media industry, including AMS, programmers and multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"). Total Audience Data, its flagship portfolio of products, consists of advanced analytics tools providing granular measurement of consumer groups, accurate hyper-local ratings and other insights into target audience behavior not available through traditional sample-based measurement services. These tools allow us and our clients to more precisely optimize our product offerings, target and deliver ads more efficiently, and provide accurate measurement to our clients and partners.
        Our March 2017 acquisition of Audience Partners, a leading provider of data-driven, audience-based digital advertising solutions, expands the scope of targeted advertising solutions we offer from television to include digital, mobile and tablets. In addition, the acquisition expands our audience-based advertising services to include further advanced analytics tools within key and growing segments, including political, advocacy, healthcare, automotive, and programming. 
News 12 Networks
        Our News 12 Networks consists of seven 24-hour local news channels in the New York metropolitan area—the Bronx, Brooklyn, Connecticut, Hudson Valley, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester—providing each with complete access to hyper-local breaking news, traffic, weather, sports, and more. In addition, News 12 Networks also includes five traffic and weather channels that offer constantly updated information; the award-winning News12.com, the premier destination for local news on the web; News 12 Interactive, channel 612 on Optimum TV, providing local news on demand; and News 12 To Go, the network's mobile app for phones and tablets. Since launching in 1986, News 12 Networks has been widely recognized by the news industry with numerous prestigious honors and awards, including over 230 Emmy Awards, plus multiple Edward R. Murrow Awards, NY Press Club Awards, and more. We derive revenue from our News 12 Networks for the sale of advertising and affiliation fees paid by cable operators. Advertising revenue is included in "Advertising" and affiliation fees charged for the programming are included in "Other."
Franchises
        As of December 31, 2017, our systems operated in more than 1,300 communities pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by state and local governmental authorities. Franchise agreements typically require the payment of franchise fees and contain regulatory provisions addressing, among other things, service quality, cable service to schools and other public institutions, insurance and indemnity. Franchise authorities generally charge a franchise fee of not more than 5% of certain of our cable service revenues that are derived from the operation of the system within such locality. We generally pass the franchise fee on to our customers.
        Franchise agreements are usually for a term of 5 to 15 years from the date of grant (a majority of which are for 10 years), however, approximately 400 of Altice’s communities are now served under perpetual state-issued franchises. Franchise agreements are usually terminable only if the cable operator fails to comply with material provisions and then 
8

only after the franchising authority complies with substantive and procedural protections afforded by the franchise agreement and federal and state law. Prior to the scheduled expiration of most franchises, we generally initiate renewal proceedings with the granting authorities. This process usually takes less than three years but can take a longer period of time. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"), which is the primary federal statute regulating interstate communications, provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably withhold renewals. See "Regulation—Cable Television—Franchising." In connection with the franchise renewal process, many governmental authorities require the cable operator to make certain commitments, such as building out certain franchise areas, meeting customer service requirements and supporting and carrying public access channels.
        Historically, we have been able to renew our franchises without incurring significant costs, although any particular franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable terms or otherwise. We expect to renew or continue to operate under all or substantially all of these franchises. For more information regarding risks related to our franchises, see "Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Regulatory and Legislative Matters—Our cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. The failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business." Proposals to streamline cable franchising recently have been adopted at both the federal and state levels. For more information see "Regulation—Cable Television—Franchising."
Programming
        We design our channel line-ups for each system according to demographics, programming contract requirements, market research, viewership, local programming preferences, channel capacity, competition, price sensitivity and local regulation. We believe offering a wide variety of programming influences a customer's decision to subscribe to and retain our pay television services. We obtain programming, including basic, expanded basic, digital, HD, VOD and broadband content, from a number of suppliers, including broadcast and cable networks.
        We generally carry cable networks pursuant to written programming contracts, which continue for a fixed period of time, usually from three to five years, and are subject to negotiated renewal. Cable network programming is usually made available to us for a license fee, which is generally paid based on the number of customers who subscribe to the level of service that provides such programming. Such license fees may include "volume" discounts available for higher numbers of customers, as well as discounts for channel placement or service penetration. Where possible, we negotiate volume discount pricing structures. For home shopping channels, we receive a percentage of the revenue attributable to our customers' purchases, as well as, in some instances, incentives for channel placement.
        We typically seek flexible distribution terms that would permit services to be made available in a variety of retail packages and on a variety of platforms and devices in order to maximize consumer choice. Suppliers typically insist that their most popular and attractive services be distributed to a minimum number or percentage of customers, which limits our ability to provide consumers full purchasing flexibility. Suppliers also typically seek to control or limit the terms on which we are able to make their services available on various platforms and devices yet this has become more flexible each year.
        Our cable programming costs have increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost-of-living type increases. We expect programming costs to continue to increase due to a variety of factors including annual increases imposed by stations and programmers and additional programming being provided to customers, including HD, digital and VOD programming. In particular, broadcast and sports programming costs have increased significantly over the past several years. In addition, contracts to purchase sports programming sometimes provide for optional additional programming to be available on a surcharge basis during the term of the contract. These increases have coincided with a significant increase in the quality of the programming, from high production value original cable series to enhanced camera and statistical data technology in sports broadcasts, and more flexible rights to make the content available on various platforms and devices.
        We have programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire in the near term. We will seek to renegotiate the terms of these agreements, but there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. To the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we have been, and may in the future be, forced to remove such programming channels from our line-up, which may result in a loss of customers. For example, in 2017, we were unable to reach agreement with Starz on acceptable economic terms, and effective January 1, 2018, all Starz services were removed from our lineups 
9

in our Optimum and Suddenlink segments, and we launched alternative networks offered by other programmers under new long-term contracts. On February 13, 2018, we and Starz reached a new carriage agreement and we started restoring the Starz services previously offered by Optimum and Suddenlink. Also in our Suddenlink segment, we were unable to reach agreement with Viacom on acceptable economic terms for a long-term contract renewal, and effective October 1, 2014, all Viacom networks were removed from our channel lineups in our Suddenlink segment, and we launched alternative networks offered by other programmers under new long-term contracts. We and Viacom did not reach a new agreement to include certain Viacom networks in the Suddenlink channel lineup until May 2017. For more information, see "Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business—Programming and retransmission costs are increasing and we may not have the ability to pass these increases on to our customers. Disputes with programmers and the inability to retain or obtain popular programming can adversely affect our relationship with customers and lead to customer losses."
Sales and Marketing
        Sales are managed centrally and multiple sales channels are leveraged to reach current and potential customers, including in-bound customer care centers, outbound telemarketing, stores, field technician sales and door-to-door sales. E-commerce is also managed centrally on behalf of the organization and is a growing and dynamic part of our business and is our fastest growing sales channel. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, 27% of our gross adds were via our online sales channel, compared to 14% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. We also use mass media, including broadcast television, digital media, radio, newspaper and outdoor advertising, to attract customers and direct them to our in-bound customer care centers or website. Our sales and service employees use a variety of sales tools as they work to match customers' needs with our best-in-class products, with a focus on building and enhancing customer relationships.
        Because of our local presence and market knowledge, we invest heavily in targeted marketing. Our strategic focus is on building new customer relationships and bundling broadband, pay television and telephony services. Our promotional materials and messaging focus on how our products and services deliver innovative solutions to customer pain points. Much of our advertising is developed centrally and customized for our regions. Among other factors, we monitor customer perceptions, marketing tactic impact and competition, to increase our responsiveness and the effectiveness of our efforts. Our footprint has several large college markets where we market specialized products and services to students for multiple dwelling units ("MDUs"), such as dormitories and apartment complexes.
        We have separate dedicated sales teams for our SMB and enterprise offerings and dedicated service teams to support SMB and enterprise clients.
Altice Technical Services
In January 2018, the Company acquired 70% of the equity interests in Altice Technical Services US Corp. ("ATS") for $1.00 (the "ATS Acquisition") and the Company expects to become the owner of 100% of the equity interests in ATS prior to the Distribution. ATS was previously owned by Altice N.V. and a member of ATS's management through a holding company. In light of Altice N.V.'s determination to focus on businesses other than the Company, we and Altice N.V. concluded it is in Altice N.V.'s and the Company's interests for Altice USA to own and operate ATS. The ATS Acquisition was approved by our Audit Committee pursuant to the Company's related-party transaction approval policy.
ATS has and will continue to provide technical operating services to the Company, including field services, such as dispatch, customer installations, disconnects, service changes and other customer service visits, outside plant maintenance services and design and construction services for HFC and FTTH infrastructure pursuant to an Independent Contractor Agreement and Transition Services Agreement with the Company.
Customer Experience
        We believe customer service is the cornerstone of our business. Accordingly, we make a concerted effort to continually improve each customer's experience and have made significant investments in our people, processes and technology to enhance our customers' experience and to reduce the number of times customers need to contact us. The insights from operational metrics help us focus our improvement efforts. For example, we link internal sales incentives to early churn and product mix, as opposed to more traditional criteria of new sales, in order to refocus our organization away from churn retention to churn prevention.

        Our customer care centers are managed and operated locally, with the deployment and execution of end-to-end care strategies and initiatives conducted on a site-by-site basis. We have residential and commercial customer care centers located throughout our footprint, including in Newark, NJ; Jericho, NY; Bronx, NY; Melville, NY; Tyler, TX; and Lubbock, TX. Our customer care centers function as an integrated system and utilize software programs that provide increased efficiencies and limited wait-times for customers requiring support.
        We provide technical service to our customers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and we have systems that allow our customer care centers to be accessed and managed remotely in the event that systems functionality is temporarily lost, which provides our customers access to customer service with limited disruption.
        We also utilize our customer portal to enable our customers to view and pay their bills online, obtain useful information and perform various equipment troubleshooting procedures. Our customers may also obtain support through our online chat, e-mail functionality and social media websites, including Twitter and Facebook.
Network Management
        Our cable systems are generally designed with an HFC architecture that has proven to be highly flexible in meeting the increasing needs of our customers. We deliver our signals via laser-fed fiber optic cable from control centers known as headends and hubs to individual nodes. Each node is connected to the individual homes served by us. A primary benefit of this design is that it pushes fiber optics closer to our customers' homes, which allows us to subdivide our systems into smaller service groups and make capital investments only in service groups experiencing higher than average service growth.
        As of December 31, 2017, approximately 96% of our basic pay television customers were served by systems with a capacity of at least 750 MHz and approximately 275 homes per node. Our Optimum network has been upgraded to nearly four times the maximum available broadband speeds and we have expanded our Gbps broadband service to approximately 72% of our Suddenlink footprint, compared to approximately 40% prior to the Suddenlink Acquisition. More than 99% of our residential broadband Internet customers are connected to our national backbone with a presence in major carrier access points in New York, Dallas, Chicago, San Jose, Washington D.C. and Phoenix. This presence allows us to avoid significant Internet transit costs by establishing peering relationships with major Internet service and content providers enabling direct connectivity with them at these access points.
We also have a networking caching architecture that places highly viewed Internet traffic from the largest Internet-based content providers at the edge of the network closest to the customer to reduce bandwidth requirements across our national backbone, thus reducing operating expense. This collective network architecture also provides us with the capability to manage traffic across several Internet access points, thus helping to ensure Internet access redundancy and quality of service for our customers. Additionally, our national backbone connects most of our systems, which allows for an efficient and economical deployment of services from our centralized platforms that include telephone, VOD, network DVR, common pay television content, broadband Internet, hosted business solutions, provisioning, e-mail and other related services.
        We have also commenced a plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We believe this FTTH network will be more resilient with reduced maintenance requirements, fewer service outages and lower power usage, which we expect will drive further structural cost efficiencies.
        We have also focused on system reliability and disaster recovery as part of our national backbone and primary system strategy. For example, to help ensure a high level of reliability of our services, we implemented redundant power capability, as well as fiber route and carrier diversity in our networks serving most of our customers. With respect to disaster recovery, we invested in our telephone platform architecture for geo-redundancy to minimize downtime in the event of a disaster to any single facility. Additionally, we are working to implement a geo-redundant disaster recovery environment for our network operations center supporting both residential and business customers.
        In addition, we have expanded and refined our bandwidth utilization in capacity constrained systems in order to meet demand for new and improved advanced services. A key component to reclaim bandwidth was the digital delivery of pay television channels that were previously distributed in analog through the launch of digital simulcast, which duplicates analog channels as digital channels. Additionally, the deployment of lower-cost digital customer premises equipment, such as HD digital transport adapters, enabled the use of more efficient digital channels instead of analog 
11

channels, thus allowing the reclamation of expanded basic analog bandwidth in the targeted systems. This reclaimed analog bandwidth could then be repurposed for other advanced services such as additional HDTV services and faster Internet access speeds. This technology has the added benefit of providing improved picture and sound quality to customers for most of their pay television programming.
Information Technology
        Our IT systems consist of billing, customer relationship management, business and operational support and sales force management systems. We are updating and simplifying our IT infrastructure through further investments, focusing on cost efficiencies, improved system reliability, functionality and scalability and enhancing the ability of our IT infrastructure to meet our ongoing business objectives. Further, we have made significant progress in integrating and consolidating the IT platforms and systems and streamlining the processes of Optimum and Suddenlink, which has driven operating efficiencies. Additionally, through investment in our IT platforms and focus on process improvement, we have simplified and harmonized our service offering bundles, optimized our technical service delivery and improved customer service.
Suppliers
Customer Premise and Network Equipment
        We purchase set-top boxes and other customer premise equipment from a limited number of vendors because each of our cable systems uses one or two proprietary technology architectures. We also buy HD, HD/DVRs and VOD equipment, routers, including the components of our new home communications hub, and other network equipment from a limited number of suppliers, including Altice Labs, Altice N.V.'s technology, services and innovation center. See "Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business—We rely on network and information systems for our operations and a disruption or failure of, or defects in, those systems may disrupt our operations, damage our reputation with customers and adversely affect our results of operations."
Broadband and Telephone Connectivity
        We deliver broadband and telephony services through our HFC network. We use circuits that are either owned by us or leased from third parties to connect to the Internet and the public switched telephone network. We pay fees for leased circuits based on the amount of capacity available to it and pay for Internet connectivity based on the amount of IP-based traffic received from and sent over the other carrier's network.
Competition
        We operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of broadband, pay television and telephony providers and delivery systems, including broadband communications companies, wireless data and telephony providers, satellite delivered video signals, Internet-delivered video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers in our service areas. We believe our leading market positions in our footprint, technologically advanced network infrastructure, including our FTTH build-out, our new home communications hub and our focus on enhancing the customer experience favorably position us to compete in our industry. See also "Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business—We operate in a highly competitive business environment which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity."
Broadband Services Competition
        Our broadband services face competition from broadband communications companies' digital subscriber line ("DSL"), FTTH and wireless broadband offerings as well as from a variety of companies that offer other forms of online services, including satellite-based broadband services. Current and future fixed and wireless Internet services, such as 3G, 4G and 5G fixed and wireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as wireless data cards, tablets and smartphones, and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may compete with our broadband services.
Pay Television Services Competition
        We face intense competition from broadband communications companies with fiber-based networks, primarily Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon"), which has constructed a FTTH network plant that passes a significant number of households in our Optimum service area. We estimate that Verizon is currently able to sell a fiber-based pay television 
12

service, as well as broadband and VoIP services, to at least half of the households in our Optimum service area. In addition, Frontier offers pay television service in competition with us in most of our Connecticut service area.
        We also compete with direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") providers, such as DirecTV (a subsidiary of AT&T Inc.) and DISH Network Corporation ("DISH Network"). DirecTV and DISH offer one-way satellite-delivered pre-packaged programming services that are received by relatively small and inexpensive receiving dishes. DirecTV has exclusive arrangements with the National Football League that give it access to programming that we cannot offer. AT&T also has an agreement to acquire Time Warner Inc., which owns a number of cable networks, including TBS, CNN and HBO, and Warner Bros. Entertainment, which produces television, film and home-video content. However, we believe cable-delivered VOD services, which include HD programming, offer a competitive advantage to DBS service because cable headends can provide two-way communication to deliver a large volume of programming which customers can access and control independently, whereas DBS technology can only make available a much smaller amount of programming with DVR-like customer control.
        Our pay television services also face competition from a number of other sources, including companies that deliver movies, television shows and other pay television programming over broadband Internet connections to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices, such as Hulu, iTunes, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube, Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now and Sling TV.
Telephony Services Competition
        Our telephony service competes with wireline, wireless and OTT phone providers, such as Vonage, Skype, GoogleTalk, Facetime, WhatsApp and magicJack, as well as companies that sell phone cards at a cost per minute for both national and international service. In addition, we compete with other forms of communication, such as text messaging on cellular phones, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email. The increase in the number of different technologies capable of carrying telephony services and the number of alternative communication options available to customers as well as the replacement of wireline services by wireless have intensified the competitive environment in which we operate our telephony services.
Business Services Competition
        We operate in highly competitive business telecommunications market and compete primarily with local incumbent telephone companies, especially AT&T, CenturyLink, Inc. ("Centurylink"), Frontier and Verizon, as well as from a variety of other national and regional business services competitors.
Advertising Sales Competition
        We face intense competition for advertising revenue across many different platforms and from a wide range of local and national competitors. Advertising competition has increased and will likely continue to increase as new formats seek to attract the same advertisers. We compete for advertising revenue against, among others, local broadcast stations, national cable and broadcast networks, radio stations, print media and online advertising companies and content providers.
Regulation
Our cable and related services are subject to a variety of federal, state and local law and regulations. The Communications Act, and the rules, regulations and policies of the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), as well as other federal and state laws governing cable television, communications, consumer protection, privacy and related matters, affect significant aspects of our cable system and services operations.
The following paragraphs describe the existing legal and regulatory requirements we believe are most significant to our cable system operations today. Our business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework, whether triggered by legislative, administrative or judicial rulings.
Cable Television
Franchising.    The Communications Act requires cable operators to obtain a non-exclusive franchise from state or local franchising authorities to provide cable service. Although the terms of franchise agreements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, they typically require payment of franchise fees and contain regulatory provisions addressing, among other things, use of the right of way, service quality, cable service to schools and other public institutions, insurance, indemnity and sales of assets or changes in ownership. State and local franchising authority, however, must be exercised consistent 
13

with the Communications Act, which sets limits on franchising authorities' powers, including limiting franchise fees to no more than 5% of gross revenues from the provision of cable service, prohibiting franchising authorities from requiring us to carry specific programming services, and protecting the renewal expectation of franchisees by limiting the factors a franchising authority may consider and requiring a due process hearing before denying renewal. Even when franchises are renewed, however, the franchise authority may, except where prohibited by applicable law, seek to impose new and more onerous requirements as a condition of renewal. Similarly, if a franchising authority's consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system, the franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirements as a condition for providing its consent. Cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance. They may also be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions.
In recent years, the traditional local cable franchising regime underwent significant change as a result of various federal and state actions. Several states have reduced or eliminated the role of local, municipal government in franchising in favor of state or system-wide franchises, and the trend has been toward consolidation of franchising authority at the state level, in part to accommodate the interests of new broadband and cable entrants over the last decade. At the same time, the FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (such as those affiliated with broadband communications companies) and reduce certain franchising burdens for these new entrants. The FCC adopted more modest relief for existing cable operators, but a recent federal court decision curtailed a portion of this relief that relates to the cap on in-kind payments to franchising authorities.
Pricing and Packaging.    The Communications Act and the FCC's rules limit the scope of price regulation for cable television services. Among other limitations, franchising authorities may regulate rates for only "basic" cable service. In 2015, the FCC adopted an order reversing its historic approach to this local rate regulation. Previously, rate regulation was in effect in a community unless and until a cable operator successfully petitioned the FCC for relief by showing the existence of "effective competition" (as defined under federal law) in the community. The FCC reversed that presumption, barring franchise authority rate regulation absent an affirmative showing by the franchising authority that there is an absence of effective competition. As none of our franchise authorities have filed the necessary rate regulation certification, none of our pay television customers are currently subject to rate regulation.
There have been frequent calls to impose further rate regulation on the cable industry. It is possible that Congress or the FCC may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming. For example, there has been legislative and regulatory interest in requiring cable operators to offer historically bundled programming services on an à la carte basis. In addition, the FCC recently initiated a proceeding exploring how programming practices involving MVPDs affect the availability of diverse and independent programming. As we attempt to respond to a changing marketplace with competitive marketing and pricing practices, we may face regulations that impede our ability to compete.
Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent.    Cable operators are required to carry, without compensation, programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations that elect "must carry" status.
Alternatively, local commercial broadcast television stations may elect "retransmission consent," giving up their must-carry right and instead negotiating with cable systems the terms on which the cable systems may carry the station's programming content. Cable systems generally may not carry a broadcast station that has elected retransmission consent without the station's consent. The terms of retransmission consent agreements frequently include the payment of compensation to the station.
Broadcast stations must elect "must carry" or retransmission consent every three years. A substantial number of local broadcast stations currently carried by our cable systems have elected to negotiate for retransmission consent. In the most recent retransmission consent negotiations, popular television stations have demanded substantial compensation increases, thereby increasing our operating costs.
Ownership Limitations.    Federal regulation of the communications field traditionally included a host of ownership restrictions, which limited the size of certain media entities and restricted their ability to enter into competing enterprises. Through a series of legislative, regulatory, and judicial actions, most of these restrictions have been either eliminated or substantially relaxed. The FCC is currently considering substantial changes in this area, which could alter the business environment in which we operate.
Set-Top Boxes.    The Communications Act includes a provision that requires the FCC to take certain steps to support the development of a retail market for "navigation devices," such as cable set-top boxes. As a result, the FCC has adopted certain mandates, from time to time, to require cable operators to accommodate third party navigation devices, sometimes imposing substantial development and operating requirements on the industry. From time to time, the FCC has proposed additional rules to effectuate this mandate, though there is no currently active effort to advance these proposals. Nevertheless, the FCC may in the future consider implementing other measures to promote the competitive availability of retail set-top boxes or third party navigation options that could impact our customers' experience, our ability to capture user interactions to refine and enhance our services, and our ability to provide a consistent customer support environment.
14

PEG and Leased Access.     Franchising authorities may require that we support the delivery and support for public, educational, or governmental ("PEG") channels on our cable systems. In addition to providing PEG channels, we must make a limited number of commercial leased access channels available to third parties (including parties with potentially competitive pay television services) at regulated rates. The FCC adopted revised rules several years ago mandating a significant reduction in the rates that operators can charge commercial leased access users. These rules were stayed, however, by a federal court, pending a cable industry appeal. This matter currently remains pending, and the revised rules are not yet in effect. Although commercial leased access activity historically has been relatively limited, increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of our cable systems.
Pole Attachments.    The company makes extensive use of utility poles and conduit owned by other utilities to attach and install the facilities that are integral to our network and services. The Communications Act requires most utilities to provide cable systems with access to poles and conduits for access to attach such facilities at regulated rates. States (or, where states choose not to regulate, the FCC) regulate utility company rates for the rental of pole and conduit space used by companies, including operators like us, to provide cable, telecommunications services, and Internet access services, unless states establish their own regulations in this area. Many states in which we operate have elected to set their own pole attachment rules.
In 2011 and again in 2015, the FCC amended its pole attachment rules to promote broadband deployment. The 2011 order allows for new penalties in certain cases involving unauthorized attachments, but generally strengthens the cable industry's ability to access investor-owned utility poles on reasonable rates, terms and conditions. Additionally, the 2011 order reduces the federal rate formula previously applicable to "telecommunications" attachments to closely approximate the more favorable rate formula applicable to "cable" attachments. The 2015 Order continues this rate reconciliation, effectively closing a remaining "loophole" that potentially allowed for significantly higher rates for telecommunications attachments in certain scenarios. Neither the 2011 order nor the 2015 Order directly affects the rate in states that self-regulate (rather than allowing the FCC to regulate) pole rates, but many of those states have substantially the same rate for cable and telecommunications attachments. Adverse changes to the pole attachment rate structure, rate, and classifications could significantly increase our annual pole attachment costs.
Program Access.    The program access rules generally prohibit a cable operator from improperly influencing an affiliated satellite-delivered cable programming service to discriminate unfairly against an unaffiliated distributor where the purpose or effect of such influence is to significantly hinder or prevent the competitor from providing satellite-delivered cable programming. FCC rules also allow a competing distributor to bring a complaint against a cable-affiliated terrestrially-delivered programmer or its affiliated cable operator for alleged violations of this rule, and seek reformed terms of carriage as remedy.
Program Carriage.    The FCC's program carriage rules prohibit us from requiring that an unaffiliated programmer grant us a financial interest or exclusive carriage rights as a condition of its carriage on our cable systems and prohibit us from unfairly discriminating against unaffiliated programmers in the terms and conditions of carriage on the basis of their nonaffiliation.
On October 12, 2011, Game Show Network ("GSN") filed a program carriage complaint against Cablevision, alleging that we discriminated against it in the terms and conditions of carriage based on GSN's lack of affiliation with us. Although the Enforcement Bureau of the FCC recommended on October 15, 2015, that the administrative law judge adjudicating this dispute find in our favor because GSN had not satisfied its burden of proving that we discriminated against it on the basis of affiliation, the administrative law judge issued his initial decision in GSN's favor on November 23, 2016, requiring that we restore GSN to the expanded basic tier. The FCC reversed that decision and denied GSN's complaint on July 13, 2017. GSN initiated review of that decision in a federal appeals court on September 11, 2017. We believe GSN's claims are without merit and intervened in GSN's appeal to support the FCC's decision on October 11, 2017. On December 28, 2017, we entered into a binding settlement agreement with GSN. On January 25, 2018, the federal court of appeals entered dismissal of the action.
Exclusive Access to Multitenant Buildings.    The FCC has prohibited cable operators from entering into or enforcing exclusive agreements with owners of multitenant buildings under which the operator is the only MVPD with access to the building.
CALM Act.    The FCC's rules require us to ensure that all commercials carried on our cable service comply with specified volume standards.
Privacy and Data Security.    In the course of providing our services, we collect certain information about our customers and their use of our services. We also collect certain information regarding potential customers and other individuals. Our collection, use, disclosure and other handling of information is subject to a variety of federal and state privacy requirements, including those imposed specifically on cable operators and telecommunications service providers by the Communications Act. We are also subject to data security obligations, as well as requirements to provide notice to individuals and governmental 
15

entities in the event of certain data security breaches, and such breaches, depending on their scope and consequences, may lead to litigation and enforcement actions with the potential of substantial monetary forfeitures or to adversely affect our brand.
As cable operators provide interactive and other advanced services, additional privacy and data security requirements may arise through legislation, regulation or judicial decisions. For example, the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 has been extended to cover online interactive services through which customers can buy or rent movies. In addition, Congress, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), and other lawmakers and regulators are all considering whether to adopt additional measures that could impact the collection, use, and disclosure of customer information in connection with the delivery of advertising and other services to consumers customized to their interests. In October 2016, the FCC adopted new privacy and data security rules governing the use of customer information by broadband ISPs, including cable ISPs and providers of VoIP. These new rules permit the collection and use of non-sensitive customer information subject to the customers' ability to opt out, but require the customers' opt-in before access, use or disclosure of sensitive proprietary information. These new rules are more stringent than the FTC's privacy standards. The FCC suspended the data security portion of these rules in February. In March, both houses of Congress voted to overturn all of the rules. This legislation was signed by the President in April and it is now effective. Some states are now considering imposing similar rules, however.
Federal Copyright Regulation.    We are required to pay copyright royalty fees on a semi-annual basis to receive a statutory compulsory license to carry broadcast television content. These fees are subject to periodic audit by the content owners. The amount of a cable operator's royalty fee payments are determined by a statutory formula that takes into account various factors, including the amount of "gross receipts" received from customers for "basic" service, the number of "distant" broadcast signals carried and the characteristics of those distant signals (e.g., network, independent or noncommercial). Certain elements of the royalty formula are subject to adjustment from time to time, which can lead to increases in the amount of our semi-annual royalty payments. The U.S. Copyright Office, which administers the collection of royalty fees, has made recommendations to Congress for changes in or elimination of the statutory compulsory licenses for cable television carriage of broadcast signals and the U.S. Government Accountability Office is conducting a statutorily-mandated inquiry into whether the cable compulsory license should be phased out. Changes to copyright regulations could adversely affect the ability of our cable systems to obtain such programming, and could increase the cost of such programming. Similarly, we must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations. These licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the past, and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future.
 Access for Persons with Disabilities.    The FCC's rules require us to ensure that persons with disabilities can more fully access the programming we carry. We are required to provide closed captions and pass through video description to customers on some networks we carry, and to provide an easy means of activating closed captioning and to ensure the audio accessibility of emergency information navigation capabilities of our video offerings.
 Other Regulation.    We are subject to various other regulations, including those related to political broadcasting; home wiring; the blackout of certain network and syndicated programming; prohibitions on transmitting obscene programming; limitations on advertising in children's programming; and standards for emergency alerts, as well as telemarketing and general consumer protection laws and equal employment opportunity obligations. The FCC also imposes various technical standards on our operations. In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, the FCC and the states are examining whether new requirements are necessary to improve the resiliency of communications networks, potentially including cable networks. Each of these regulations restricts our business practices to varying degrees. The FCC can aggressively enforce compliance with its regulations and consumer protection policies, including the imposition of substantial monetary sanctions. It is possible that Congress or the FCC will expand or modify its regulations of cable systems in the future, and we cannot predict at this time how that might impact our business.
Broadband
Regulatory Classification.    Broadband Internet access services were traditionally classified by the FCC as "information services" for regulatory purposes, a type of service that is subject to a lesser degree of regulation than "telecommunications services." In 2015, the FCC reversed this determination and classified broadband Internet access services as "telecommunications services." This reclassification had subjected our broadband Internet access service to greater regulation, although the FCC did not apply all telecommunications service obligations to broadband Internet access service. The 2015 Order could have had a material adverse impact on our business. In December 2017, the FCC adopted an order that in large part reversed again the 2015 Order and reestablished the "information service" classification for broadband Internet access service. The 2017 Order has not yet gone into effect, however, and the 2015 Order will remain binding until the 2017 Order takes effect. The 2017 Order is expected to be subject to legal challenge that may delay its effect or overturn it.

Net Neutrality.    The 2015 Order also established a new "Open Internet" framework that expanded disclosure requirements on Internet service providers ("ISPs") such as cable companies, prohibited blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization of Internet traffic on the basis of the content, and imposed a "general conduct standard" that prohibits unreasonable interference with the ability of end users and edge providers to reach each other. The FCC's 2017 Order eliminates these rules except for certain disclosure requirements. As noted above, however, we cannot be certain when or if the 2017 Order will take effect. Additionally, Congress and some states are considering legislation that may codify "net neutrality" rules. 
Access for Persons with Disabilities.    The FCC's rules require us to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to "advanced communications services" ("ACS"), such as electronic messaging and interoperable video conferencing. They also require that certain pay television programming delivered via Internet Protocol include closed captioning and require entities distributing such programming to end users to pass through such captions and identify programming that should be captioned.
Other Regulation.    The 2015 Order also subjected broadband providers' Internet traffic exchange rates and practices to potential FCC oversight and created a mechanism for third parties to file complaints regarding these matters. In addition, our provision of Internet services also subjects us to the limitations on use and disclosure of user communications and records contained in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. Broadband Internet access service is also subject to other federal and state privacy laws applicable to electronic communications.
 Additionally, providers of broadband Internet access services must comply with Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (‘‘CALEA’’), which requires providers to make their services and facilities accessible for law enforcement intercept requests. Various other federal and state laws apply to providers of services that are accessible through broadband Internet access service, including copyright laws, telemarketing laws, prohibitions on obscenity, and a ban on unsolicited commercial e-mail, and privacy and data security laws. Online content we provide is also subject to some of these laws.
Other forms of regulation of broadband Internet access service currently being considered by the FCC, Congress or state legislatures include consumer protection requirements, cyber security requirements, consumer service standards, requirements to contribute to universal service programs and requirements to protect personally identifiable customer data from theft. Pending and future legislation in this area could adversely affect our operations as an Internet service provider and our relationship with our Internet customers.
       Additionally, from time to time the FCC and Congress have considered whether to subject broadband Internet access services to the federal Universal Service Fund ("USF") contribution requirements. Any contribution requirements adopted for Internet access services would impose significant new costs on our broadband Internet service. At the same time, the FCC is changing the manner in which Universal Service funds are distributed. By focusing on broadband and wireless deployment, rather than traditional telephone service, the changes could assist some of our competitors in more effectively competing with our service offerings.
Telephony Services - VoIP
We provide telephony services using VoIP technology ("interconnected VoIP"). The FCC has adopted several regulations for interconnected VoIP services, as have several states, especially as it relates to core customer and safety issues such as E911, local number portability, disability access, outage reporting, universal service contributions, and regulatory reporting requirements. The FCC has not, however, formally classified interconnected VoIP services as either information services or telecommunications services. In this vacuum, some states have asserted more expansive rights to regulate interconnected VoIP services, while others have adopted laws that bar the state commission from regulating VoIP service.
Universal Service.     Interconnected VoIP services must contribute to the USF used to subsidize communication services provided to low income households, to customers in rural and high cost areas, and to schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. The amount of universal service contribution required of interconnected VoIP service providers is based on a percentage of revenues earned from interstate and international services provided to end users. We allocate our end user revenues and remit payments to the universal service fund in accordance with FCC rules. The FCC has ruled that states may impose state universal service fees on interconnected VoIP providers.
Local Number Portability.   The FCC requires interconnected VoIP service providers and their "numbering partners" to ensure that their customers have the ability to port their telephone numbers when changing providers. We also contribute to federal funds to meet the shared costs of local number portability and the costs of North American Numbering Plan Administration.
Intercarrier Compensation.    In an October 2011 reform order and subsequent clarifying orders, the FCC revised the regime governing payments among providers of telephony services for the exchange of calls between and among different networks ("intercarrier compensation") to, among other things, explicitly include interconnected VoIP. In that Order, the FCC determined that intercarrier compensation for all terminating traffic, including VoIP traffic exchanged in time-division 
17

multiplexing ("TDM") format, will be phased down over several years to a "bill-and-keep" regime, with no compensation between carriers for most terminating traffic by 2018. The FCC is considering further reform in this area, which could reduce or eliminate compensation for originating traffic as well.
Other Regulation.     Interconnected VoIP service providers are required to provide enhanced 911 emergency services to their customers; protect customer proprietary network information from unauthorized disclosure to third parties; report to the FCC on service outages; comply with telemarketing regulations and other privacy and data security requirements; comply with disabilities access requirements and service discontinuance obligations; comply with call signaling requirements; and comply with CALEA standards. In August 2015, the FCC adopted new rules to improve the resiliency of the communications network. Under the new rules, providers of telephony services, including interconnected VoIP service providers, must make available eight hours of standby backup power for consumers to purchase at the point of sale. The rules also require that providers inform new and current customers about service limitations during power outages and steps that consumers can take to address those risks.
Telephony Services - Traditional
We operate traditional telecommunications services under the trade name Lightpath in various state subsidiaries, and those services are largely governed under rules established for CLECs under the Communications Act. The Communications Act entitles our CLEC subsidiaries to certain rights, but as telecommunications carriers, it also subjects them to regulation by the FCC and the states. Their designation as telecommunications carriers also results in other regulations that may affect them and the services they offer.
Interconnection and Intercarrier Compensation.    The Communications Act requires telecommunications carriers to interconnect directly or indirectly with other telecommunications carriers. Under the FCC's intercarrier compensation rules, we are entitled, in some cases, to compensation from carriers when they use our network to terminate or originate calls and in other cases are required to compensate another carrier for using its network to originate or terminate traffic. The FCC and state regulatory commissions, including those in the states in which we operate, have adopted limits on the amounts of compensation that may be charged for certain types of traffic. As noted above, the FCC has determined that intercarrier compensation for all terminating traffic will be phased down over several years to a "bill-and-keep" regime, with no compensation between carriers for most terminating traffic by 2018, and is considering further reform that could reduce or eliminate compensation for originating traffic as well.
Universal Service.    Our CLEC subsidiaries are required to contribute to the USF. The amount of universal service contribution required of us is based on a percentage of revenues earned from interstate and international services provided to end users. We allocate our end user revenues and remit payments to the universal service fund in accordance with FCC rules. The FCC has ruled that states may impose state universal service fees on CLEC telecommunications services.
Other Regulation.    Our CLEC subsidiaries' telecommunications services are subject to other FCC requirements, including protecting the use and disclosure of customer proprietary network information; meeting certain notice requirements in the event of service termination; compliance with disabilities access requirements; compliance with CALEA standards; outage reporting; and the payment of fees to fund local number portability administration and the North American Numbering Plan. As noted above, the FCC and states are examining whether new requirements are necessary to improve the resiliency of communications networks. Communications with our customers are also subject to FCC, FTC and state regulations on telemarketing and the sending of unsolicited commercial e-mail and fax messages, as well as additional privacy and data security requirements.
State Regulation.    Our CLEC subsidiaries' telecommunications services are subject to regulation by state commissions in each state where we provide services. In order to provide our services, we must seek approval from the state regulatory commission or be registered to provide services in each state where we operate and may at times require local approval to construct facilities. Regulatory obligations vary from state to state and include some or all of the following requirements: filing tariffs (rates, terms and conditions); filing operational, financial, and customer service reports; seeking approval to transfer the assets or capital stock of the broadband communications company; seeking approval to issue stocks, bonds and other forms of indebtedness of the broadband communications company; reporting customer service and quality of service requirements; outage reporting; making contributions to state universal service support programs; paying regulatory and state Telecommunications Relay Service and E911 fees; geographic build-out; and other matters relating to competition.
Other Services
We may provide other services and features over our cable system, such as games and interactive advertising that may be subject to a range of federal, state and local laws such as privacy and consumer protection regulations. We also maintain various websites that provide information and content regarding our businesses. The operation of these websites is also subject to a similar range of regulations.

Environmental Regulations
Our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. In part as a result of the increasing public awareness concerning the importance of environmental regulations, these regulations have become more stringent over time. Amended or new regulations could impact our operations and costs.
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2017, we had 9,047 full-time (5,962 in our Cablevision segment and 3,085 in our Suddenlink segment), 72 part-time (63 in our Cablevision segment and 9 in our Suddenlink segment) and 295 temporary employees (294 in our Cablevision segment and 1 in our Suddenlink segment) of which 208 (in our Cablevision segment) were covered under collective bargaining agreements and an additional 94 (in our Cablevision segment) were represented by a union. As of December 31, 2017, ATS had approximately 3,250 employees, none of which were covered under collective bargaining agreements or represented by a union. We believe our relations with employees are satisfactory.
