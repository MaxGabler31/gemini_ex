Item 1. Business 
Overview



Token Communities, Ltd. (hereinafter the “Company”, “Our”, “We” or “Us”) researches and creates white paper analysis for companies regarding block chain technology, and also operated the “Lukki Exchange,” including until its sale in April 2022. The Lukki Exchange offers its users the user-friendly interface an in-depth experience in crypto assets trading. We do not believe the operation of the Lukki Exchange triggers any obligations under the Securities Act or Securities Exchange Act, including any requirements to register as a national securities exchange, alternative trading system or broker-dealer, or any obligations to register with the CFTC as a futures exchange. The Lukki Exchange is operated outside of the United States (China), and not available to citizens of the United States. Further the LOT is not a “security” as established in the US Supreme Court case of SEC v Howey. The Howey Test has remained a notable determiner of regulatory oversight for many decades. In the past few years, it has been called into question, most frequently in conjunction with discussions about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In SEC v Howey, the Supreme Court articulated the legal standard for determining when a financial arrangement may be deemed an “investment contract” and, therefore, a “security.” As Howey and its progeny explain, a financial arrangement is an “investment contract” if the arrangement involves (1) an investment of money; (2) in a common enterprise; (3) with a reasonable expectation of profits to be (4) derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. The Howey Test determines that a transaction represents an investment contract if “a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party,” Here there is no evidence of investors’ reasonable expectation of profits derived predominantly from the managerial efforts of others. In recent years, the SEC has ruled that the two most valuable cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin and Ethereum—are not securities, Further we do not undertake any brokerage activities including marketing and facilitating the sale of digital assets, accepting investors’ orders and funds for payment, and enabling the disbursement of proceeds. We do not receive compensation based on a percentage of the proceeds raised.  We also do not purchase and then resell LOT for accounts in the Company’ name.

Intellectual Property



We do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our existing and planned blockchain and cryptocurrency related operations. We do not have any copyrights, trademarks, but we generally rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect and maintain our proprietary rights for our technology and products. Notwithstanding the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our products and services.
Competition



There are many companies offering or developing blockchain solutions, and there can be no assurance that direct competitors to our solutions will arise. Our technology is designed to be compliant with the new GDPR and other Governmental regulations and initiatives to protect the consumer’s data but there is no guarantee that it will be in compliance. The markets for our products are intensely competitive, continually evolving and subject to changing technologies. We face significant competition, including from companies that have entered this space much earlier than us and are better capitalized, with vertically integrated business models, larger than us, have more access to capital and have lower operating costs than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. These competitors may enter our existing or future markets with currencies that may be less expensive, that may provide higher performance or additional features or that may be introduced more quickly than our products.
Industry 



A blockchain, also known as a “distributed ledger technology,” is a sequential, ever-growing, time-stamped set of records that are grouped in blocks and maintained by disparate participants. Each block is interdependent, making alterations of records economically difficult if not outright impossible. A Blockchain includes, but is not limited to, the following features:

● | decentralized and distributed digital ledger used to record and secure transactions, which deters fraud.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | transactions cannot be changed. 
● | transactions can be verified and audited. 
● | confirmation that each unit of value was transferred only once.

The blockchain, being a globally distributed ledger running on millions of devices, is capable of recording transfers of anything of value. Two or more parties, be they businesses or individuals who may not even know each other, can forge agreements, make transactions, and build value without relying on intermediaries (such as banks, payment institutions, rating agencies and other third parties) to verify their identities, establish trust, or perform the critical business logic contracting, clearing, settling, and record-keeping tasks that are foundational to all forms of commerce. As opposed to a centralized database whereby an entire database, or full copies of that database, remains in the control of one person or entity stored on a computer that is controlled or owned by that same person or entity, a blockchain ledger typically has partial copies of itself across various nodes, or computers, in the network. Each new block requires a method of consensus between nodes of the network in order for the block to post to the ledger and become permanent. There are various methods being developed for executing a consensus. Currently, the most popular blockchain is Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, which uses a mathematical problem to be solved before it can be confirmed and added to its blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange that are transacted through and recorded on a blockchain and therefore within our scope of business. The Bitcoin consensus process, for example, entails solving complex mathematical problems using custom designed computers. However, many more public and private blockchains are being developed with different algorithms or consensus models, which can use different hardware and methods for performing function of adding blocks to their blockchains.



Cryptocurrencies are currencies that are not backed by a central bank or a national, supra-national or quasi-national organization and are not typically backed by hard assets or other credit. Cryptocurrencies are typically used as a medium of exchange, similar to fiat currencies like the U.S. Dollar. In addition to cryptocurrencies, there are other assets such as contracts or other information that reside on a blockchain that represent a form of ownership. Examples may include insurance contracts, deeds, wills, health data, or securities. The value of is determined by the value that various market participants place on them through their transactions, for example, via peer-to-peer transactions, e-commerce, or exchanges.



Government Regulation



Government regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrency is being actively considered by the United States federal government through various agencies and regulatory bodies, as well as other countries and transnational organizations, such as the European Union. State and local regulations also may apply to our activities such and other activities in which we participate or may participate in the future. Other governmental or semi-governmental regulatory bodies have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or cryptocurrency business. For instance, the SEC has taken an active role in regulating the use of public offerings of proprietary coins (so-called “Initial Coin Offerings”) and has made statements and official promulgations as to the status of certain cryptocurrencies as “securities” subject to regulation by the SEC.



Presently, we do not believe any U.S. or State regulatory body has taken any action or position adverse to our main cryptocurrency, Lukki, with respect to its production, sale, and use as a medium of exchange; however, future changes to existing regulations or entirely new regulations may affect our business in ways it is not presently possible for us to predict with any reasonable degree of reliability. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see the Section entitled “Risk Factors” herein and in our other SEC filings, which are incorporated by reference herein.



Employees



Currently we and our subsidiaries employ a total of eight individuals. These individuals consist of management, developers, sales and support staff. Some of these individuals are employed through outside sourcing companies.
