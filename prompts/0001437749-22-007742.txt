Silicon Carbide Ceramic Membranes for Liquid Filtration
 
For more than two decades, LiqTech has developed, manufactured, and sold innovative silicon carbide ceramic filtration technologies for liquid and gas purification. Our product portfolio consists of silicon carbide ceramic filters for liquid purification and diesel particulate filters for gas purification. Based on our continuous R&D, patented technologies, and evolved production methods, we are able to produce state-of-the-art silicon carbide filters.
 
Our products are manufactured with a silicon carbide ceramic membrane based on patented technology. We are not aware of other companies that make both the substrate (honeycomb) and the membrane (the part that accomplishes the filtering) solely from silicon carbide. Our products are based on the following silicon carbide membrane technologies:
 

● | CoMem ceramic membranes, which are unique patented technology designed as a tubular membrane. It utilizes a crossflow structure to handle high concentrations of suspended solids found in produced water from the oil and chemical industry, wastewater from industrial processes and manure filtration, and other applications. It offers consistent removal of oil and suspended solids at high throughput rates regardless of feed conditions. We offer onshore and offshore solutions and have extensive experience with produced water streams for fracking, gas condensate, and oil emulsions. We believe our SiC filters are the best alternative to micro-flotation and walnut shell filters due to their cost savings, reduced installation cost, robustness, and reduced downtime. Our chemically inert, plug-and-play membranes are extremely hard, chemically resistant, and durable ceramics with high flux (flow). SiC membranes are stronger, harder, longer-lasting, more temperature-resistant, and recover faster than conventional ceramic or polymeric membranes;

● | Flat sheet membranes (FSM), which are designed for submerged outside-in filtration applications. The FSM is highly applicable for wastewater reuse, groundwater, pre reverse osmosis treatment, and other applications. LiqTech’s FSM towers can be customized with different rack sizes and tower heights. The FSMs offer low energy consumption, maximum permeation, innovative rack design, and high flux;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disc membranes, which are designed for the removal of high-suspended solids, oil droplets, and process water. The disc membranes use outside-in filtration and have internal permeation channels, facilitating the removal of the solids. A crossflow effect is generated through the discs' rotation at high velocities, which enables flow cleaning of the filter membrane surface. This principle offers 80% energy savings compared to conventional cross-flow;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aqua Solution®, which integrates a dead-end structural design with cutting-edge membrane technology in a solution specifically designed for applications in the pre-treatment for reverse osmosis, wastewater treatment, and swimming pool and spa water filtration. Our Aqua Solution® offers the same water flow as conventional sand filters, which typically require up to 400 times more space and have pore sizes at least three times larger than our SiC membranes. Moreover, our Aqua Solution® reduces the number of membrane elements, pressure vessels, the water consumption for backwash, and the energy costs by offering high flow capabilities at very low pressure. Also, it eliminates the consumption or maintenance of filter cartridges; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hybrid Technology Membranes (HTM), which is a new patented asymmetric membrane that combines the desired properties from silicon carbide (SiC) and zirconia (ZrO₂) ceramics. With a pore size of 60 nanometers (nm), it is suitable for ultrafiltration applications. This state-of-the-art membrane technology facilitates new separation processes and new filtration applications.

Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) for Gas Purification
 
We offer diesel particulate filters for exhaust emission control solutions to the verified retrofit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market through our direct sales force. DPF sales are generally made to distributors specializing in sales to end-users. We use a proprietary “nano wash coat” to provide a catalytic coating for anything from diesel particulate filters to catalytic converters. Our DPF products are sold worldwide under the LiqTech brand.
 
We have developed a robust silicon carbide diesel particulate filter that is especially effective for vehicles that produce a high soot load. If properly maintained, a LiqTech DPF can last as long as the vehicle’s engine. Our DPFs are ideal for off-road vehicles because of their strength, chemical non-reactive nature, temperature resilience, and thermal conductivity.
 
Our DPF filters can handle higher soot loads than filters that do not use a silicon carbide membrane, making them ideal for situations in which engines infrequently reach high enough temperatures to burn off the soot. Examples include: 
 

● | Garbage trucks; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Port vehicles; 
● | Diesel pickup trucks not carrying a full load; 
● | Off-road construction vehicles that idle for long periods of time; and
● | Intra-city vehicles that do not reach highway speeds. 

 
Future tightening legislation in the marine industry has also created a new opportunity for our DPF product to reduce black carbon emissions from shipping.
 
Turnkey Water Treatment Solutions
 
LiqTech develop, manufacture, and sell liquid filtration systems using our patented silicon carbide technology (sometimes also referred to herein as our “SiC Filters”). Our current focus is on marine scrubber wastewater, hydrocarbon production-derived contaminated water, which we refer to herein as “produced water”, removal of heavy metals in mining and energy applications, pre-filtration for reverse osmosis in drinking water, and other industrial applications.
 
Our SiC ceramic membrane systems have been used in the following applications by our clients:
 

● | Marine Scrubber Wastewater: We supply water filtration systems for marine scrubber systems that may be employed on ships to reduce sulfur emissions stemming from heavy fuel oil (HFO) operations, allowing vessels to comply with the IMO 2020 sulfur cap.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Produced Water: Our membrane systems can be used for the filtration of produced water, which is a byproduct of oil and gas production. The amount of produced water varies from 0.1 to 10 times the amount of oil produced. We have performed testing with major international private and public oil and gas companies. Our solution is market-proven, approved by various international oil and gas companies, and applicable for onshore and offshore operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pre-filtration of Reverse Osmosis Drinking Water: To convert seawater or surface water into potable water, the seawater or surface water must be pre-filtered before entering the reverse osmosis membranes. We have a market-proven solution for pre-filtration in reverse osmosis, tested by various customers all over the world.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Industrial Applications: We have delivered complete water treatment systems for specific targeted, aggressive fluid applications such as removing heavy metals for energy providers in Denmark and Finland and water treatment systems for mining wastewater for a European mining company. In addition, our membrane systems have achieved meaningful results to reduce OPEX and increase product quality in acidic purification.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our SiC ceramic membranes provide unique advantages for the commercial pool filtration industry with the smallest footprint on the market, reduced water and chemical consumption, and consistent, high-quality water filtration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Besides the applications mentioned above utilizing silicon carbide ceramic membranes, LiqTech has many other industrial water treatment applications that do not use ceramic membranes. These applications include:
 

● | Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO): SWRO represents a brand-new LiqTech solution to turn seawater into potable water using polymeric membranes. Through its high energy efficiency and guaranteed, consistent water quality, SWRO provides one of the most efficient and sustainable solutions to convert seawater into drinkable freshwater. The LiqTech SWRO units are suitable for small commercial vessels, fishing boats, sailing boats, small port applications, and generally all places with access to seawater and where desalinated, potable water is needed.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Filter Press: The LiqTech Filter Press is a water sludge treatment system, enabling solid and liquid separation. The filter press can convert sludge into a filter cake consisting of 80% dry matter, depending on the pressure and application. One of the primary purposes of employing a filter press is to reduce discharge handling costs.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
Our products compete with other filters that are made of ceramic and polymeric materials. Most of our competitors are large industrial companies; however, we believe our patented technology allows us to produce high-quality products that provide an advantage over many of our direct and, in many cases, larger competitors. We intend to continue investing in R&D with the aim of developing new technologies and improving our existing products to reinforce our competitive advantages, retain our existing customers, and acquire new customers.
 
We believe the following strengths underpin our ability to increase revenue and profitability:
 

● | Advantages of Silicon Carbide Membranes: Our liquid filtration and diesel exhaust products utilize silicon carbide membranes, which have unique qualities that we believe make our products more effective than those of our competitors. Unlike filtration products made of aluminum oxide, silicon carbide membranes are chemically inert and temperature resistant. Furthermore, silicon carbide membranes exhibit a high degree of hydrophilicity (the tendency of a surface to become wet or absorb water), which results in unique flux (low energy consumption). Silicon carbide is also very durable, and its hardness is only surpassed by diamonds, making it a highly desirable material for various abrasive fluids in industrial applications. As a result, we believe that such superior physical properties make our products desirable in both liquid filtration products and exhaust emission control products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Complete Systems Fabrication: LiqTech provides full fabrication and integration of our membranes into complete filtration systems made from corrosive-resistant materials and components. We possess in-house engineering capabilities for process design, 3D modeling, and control. Our professional staff of highly dedicated engineers and craftsmen take responsibility for the entire specification, engineering, fabrication, and commissioning process. We believe that supplying our customers with turnkey solutions built upon our silicon carbide membranes is unique in the market. LiqTech is more than a membrane supplier — LiqTech is also a complete water treatment system supplier. 
● | Broad Application of LiqTech Membranes: Our membranes can be applied in a variety of applications, including filtration of marine scrubber wastewater, processing of industrial wastewater and produced water, pre-treatment of drinking water and pre-filtration for reverse osmosis, oil emulsion separation, bacteria removal for aquaculture, commercial swimming pool water treatment, food and beverages, and the separation of metals from liquids in industrial processes.

Our Industry

Overview
 
We serve primarily two industries: the liquid filtration market and the diesel particle filter (DPF) market. Our goal is to leverage our products and technologies into industrial liquid filtration applications that offer significant growth opportunities and take advantage of favorable market trends.
Liquid Filtration Market
 
The market for marine water filtration systems is rapidly developing due to new regulations for sulfur and ballast water emissions. Industry experts estimate that 8,000-10,000 ships will be retrofitted with a scrubber water treatment system over the next five years. At the end of 2019, the industry statistics note that nearly 4,000 ships have installed or ordered scrubbers (according to the DNV GL report March 2020), with most installations being open-loop scrubbers. Open-loop scrubbers discharge the wash water directly into the sea. The addressable market for LiqTech is focused on closed-loop scrubbers, where the scrubber wash water is routed through the LiqTech filtration system to remove sulfur and other particulates, and the clean water is then recycled as wash water.
 
As noted above, the use of open-loop scrubbers to clean the exhaust from marine engines that use high-sulfur residual oil and diesel fuels may lead to the discharge of high concentrations of harmful compounds in the waters from vessels using such scrubbers. Several trials have been conducted on board vessels by scrubber suppliers to define the constituent concentrations in wash water discharge. The research concluded that scrubber wash water also contains suspended solids, heavy metals, hydrocarbons, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Before the scrubber wash water is discharged, it must be treated to remove solids. LiqTech’s water treatment systems can be used to remove the solids from the wet scrubber wash water. The treatment process includes a pre-filtration step followed by a LiqTech SiC membrane filtration. Treated water quality is monitored (NTU, PAH, and pH) before discharge. We believe that many of the open-loop scrubbers already installed will eventually be converted to closed-loop (where the LiqTech filtration system is employed), thus resulting in a significantly larger market for LiqTech. The Company is globally engaging with scrubber equipment suppliers, ship owners/operators, and shipyards. Furthermore, we present our water treatment and filtration solutions at marine conferences and trade shows, while also through digital marketing.
 
In addition to our marine scrubbers, LiqTech offers packaged filtration systems consisting of ceramic SiC and conventional reverse-osmosis (RO) membranes for industrial and municipal customers. We anticipate that global demand will increase for robust and low operating expense products such as ours that are well-suited for mobile and modular systems. RO membranes are increasingly used to produce drinking water (desalination of seawater or brackish water), demineralized water for industrial processes (boiler feed water, microelectronics production), and food processing and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, many laboratories rely on pure water, for which demineralization is an essential step. LiqTech is differentiated by what we believe is our superior SiC membrane technology and by being able to provide a complete water treatment system. According to Global Industry Analyst report, dated April 2021, the global membrane filtration market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3%, from $14 billion in 2020 to $20 billion in 2027.
 
Generally, we also see a growing, global demand for higher-quality re-injection water from unconventional oil and gas productions. In addition, we see tightening water discharge legislation, increasing water usage (more water produced per barrel of oil), and the introduction of Enhanced Oil Recovery (“EOR”) techniques. The tightening water discharge legislation is a problem for conventional treatment and filtration technologies; however, our SiC Filters can mitigate these challenges, and we believe the increasing demand represents a favorable market trend for our business.

Water is essential to life on earth, and clean water shortages are affecting billions of people. Today, 2.2 billion people lack safely managed drinking water, and 3 billion people worldwide lack basic handwashing facilities at home. In addition, more than 700 million people could be displaced due to water scarcity (according to the UN). According to the World Health Organization, approximately 361,000 children die every year due to unsafe water and lack of basic sanitation. Due to the growing need for pure water for drinking and industrial purposes, the market for water filtration is growing rapidly, with more and larger plants being commissioned all over the world.
 
Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Market
 
Our legacy business related to the provision of DPF filters is expected to continue growing across Asia, Europe, and the United States as regulators require diesel engines to comply with new and more stringent environmental rules and regulation. In Europe, for example, German cities continue enforcing increased requirements for diesel engines to include DPF filters, with the same trend also taking place in select Asian countries.
 
Furthermore, our proprietary DPF technology has paved the way for new market opportunities such as black carbon marine, where our solutions allow both ocean-going and inland marine vessels to comply with current and future regulatory thresholds as defined by both IMO and regional regulators. In Asia, we are currently intensifying our commercial efforts and expanding our regional manufacturing capabilities in China with the aim of capitalizing on its future market potential.
 
According to an industry publication (Diesel Particulate Filter – Global Market Outlook (2017-2026)), dated January 16 2019, the global market for new DPF filters manufactured by OEMs is expected to increase approximately 13% per year from 2017 to 2026. Diesel emissions consist of several toxic gases and particles: particulate matter (soot), carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons. Soot has been linked to a variety of human health problems. Reducing diesel emissions will have both health and social benefits, along with reduced costs.
 
In response to these health impacts, governments have been implementing legislation to regulate emissions from diesel engines. California implemented the Diesel Risk Reduction Plan, and New York City implemented binding directives for the retrofitting of buses, garbage trucks, and construction machines. In the European Union, Directive EC 715/2007 of June 20, 2007, defines particle count limits for certain cars and light utility vehicles. Also, low emission zones have been implemented locally in various places in Europe, creating a patchwork of regulation.
 
The Asian markets have shown an improved standard of living due to financial growth, which has led to increased sales of vehicles in the region. At the same time, pollution in major cities has reached high particulate matter levels. As a result, the Chinese government has introduced additional regulations, including new emissions standards, faster than previously anticipated. We also believe the high pollution levels will increase the need to retrofit existing vehicles.
 
Research and Development
 
We have eighteen (18) full-time employees that are primarily engaged in research and development activities pertaining to the developing of technology and intellectual property rights related to silicon carbide product forms, applications, and manufacturing processes.
Manufacturing
 
We currently manufacture our DPF and membrane products in Ballerup, Denmark. We assemble our water treatment systems in Hobro, Denmark, and we manufacture plastic products in our facilities located in Aarhus, Denmark. We plan to expand our production capacity in China and the Middle East, primarily through investment in additional facilities and manufacturing equipment for both membranes and filter products.
Raw Materials
 
The main raw materials we use in our manufacturing processes are silicon carbide, steel, plastic, platinum, and palladium. We purchase these commodities from various sources generally based upon availability and price.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

Our products are sold primarily to large industrial customers for gas and liquid filtration. The Company sells through direct sales, systems integrators, distributors, agents, and partners.
 
The Company initially focused on selling its DPF filters to the automotive industry. In 2014, we acquired Provital Solutions, a Danish filtration system manufacturing company, which enabled us to shift our focus to providing complete, modular liquid filtration systems. The Company’s liquid filtration systems business is now rapidly expanding, focusing on the marine industry and other industrial applications in mining, power generation, aquaculture, oil and gas, and other applications within the pool industry, water reclamation, and drinking water.
 
We plan to actively market our existing products to new customers as we increase our production capacity. As of March 2022, we employed eleven (11) full-time salespeople in addition to distribution agents. We promote our products through direct sales to potential customers and marketing activities such as participation in tradeshows and exhibitions, with a heavy focus on digital marketing.
 
In certain instances, our products are delivered to the end customer through system integrators. These system integrators use our filtration products in larger filtration systems, which eventually are installed in products used by the end customer. Due to legislative regulation, system integrators are often required by end customers to receive approval for their systems, including the components used in such systems, which requires significant time and expenses. As a result, we believe that certain system integrators that use our products will not replace our filters with competitive products unless there are compelling reasons to do so. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have one issued patent in the United States that we co-own with a third party, two issued patents in Denmark, three issued foreign patents (Germany, China, and South Korea) that we co-own with a third party, and one pending European patent application that we co-own with a third party. The United States patent that we co-own is generally effective for 20 years from the filing date (July 8, 2004) of the earliest U.S. or international application to which it claims priority. The scope and duration of each of our foreign patents vary in keeping with local laws. On July 7, 2014, we obtained a new Danish patent application related to our silicon carbide membrane technology.
 
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Trade secrets, however, can be difficult to protect. We may not be able to maintain our technology or know-how as trade secrets, and competitors may develop or acquire equally valuable or more valuable technology or know-how related to the manufacture of comparable silicon carbide products. We also seek to protect our confidential and proprietary information, in part, by requiring all employees, consultants, and business partners to execute confidentiality and/or nondisclosure agreements upon the commencement of any employment, consulting arrangement, or engagement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential and proprietary information developed by the employee, consultant, or business partner, or made known to the employee, consultant, or business partner by us, during the course of the relationship with us and thereafter, be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties.
 
We also believe that having distinctive names is an important factor in marketing our products and therefore use trademarks to brand some of our products. As of March 2022, we had one trademark registration in the United States (LiqTech NA) and four trademark registrations in the European Union (AQUA SOLUTION, CoMem, CDPX, and FUTURE FILTRATION).
 
Government Regulation
 
We do not believe that we are subject to any special governmental regulations affecting our products in the countries in which we operate. We are subject to numerous health and safety laws and regulations. In the United States, these laws and regulations include the Federal Occupation Safety and Health Act and comparable state legislation. We are also subject to similar requirements in other countries in which we have extensive operations, including Denmark. We actively seek to maintain a safe, healthy and environmentally friendly workplace for all of our employees and other stakeholders.
 
  8 

  

Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the handling, storage, disposal, and release of waste and hazardous substances. It is our policy to comply with all applicable environmental requirements at each of our facilities. We are subject to similar requirements in Denmark and other European countries. From time to time, we have identified minor environmental compliance issues at our facilities. To date, compliance with environmental matters has not had a material effect upon the Company’s capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position.
 
We believe that, due to the constant focus on the environment, clean air, and clean water standards throughout the world, more stringent regulations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere around the world are likely as governmental agencies seek to improve standards required for certification of products intended to promote clean air and water. In the event our products fail to meet these changing standards, some or all our products may become obsolete, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and long-term prospects.
 
Competition

Our products compete with other filters that are made using both ceramic and plastic membranes. Most of our competitors are large industrial companies; however, we believe our patented technology, manufacturing know-how, and trade secrets allow us to produce high-quality products that provide an advantage over many of our competitors, many of which have greater financial, technological, manufacturing and personnel resources. We intend to continue to devote resources to the development of new technologies and the improvement of our products to retain existing customers and acquire new customers.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2021 we had 120 employees, including 67 in production, 12 in administration, 18 in research and development, 21 in sales and engineering and 2 in executive management.
 
Certain employees in Denmark are represented by workers’ councils that have collective bargaining agreements. With the exception of such Danish employees, no other employees are members of a labor union or are represented by workers’ councils that have collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
