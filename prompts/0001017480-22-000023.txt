Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Hibbett, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, is a leading athletic-inspired fashion retailer with approximately 1,100 stores under the Hibbett and City Gear banners, primarily located in underserved communities. Founded in 1945, Hibbett has a rich history of convenient locations, personalized customer service and access to coveted footwear, apparel and equipment from top brands like Nike, Jordan and adidas.
Our Business Strategy
We target underserved markets with branded products and provide a high level of customer service. This market strategy establishes greater customer, vendor and landlord recognition as a leading specialty retailer in these communities. We believe our ability to align our merchandising mix to local preferences and trends differentiates us from our national competitors and delivers incremental sales opportunities for our vendor partners. We use information systems to maintain tight controls over inventory and operating costs and continually search for ways to improve efficiencies and the customer experience through information system upgrades.
Our Store Brands
We operated the following store brands as of January 29, 2022:

 | | Location 
Brand | Average Square Footage | Strip Center(1) | Mall | Total
Hibbett | 5,800 | 720 | | 180 | 900
City Gear | 5,100 | 142 | | 37 | 179
Sports Additions(2) | 2,900 | 3 | | 14 | 17 

(1) Strip centers include free-standing stores and, for our Hibbett locations, are usually near a major chain retailer.
(2) Approximately 90% of the merchandise carried in our Sports Additions stores is athletic footwear.
In selecting retail locations, we consider the size, demographics, quality of real estate and competitive conditions in each market. Our stores offer a core merchandising mix of premium athletic branded footwear, apparel, accessories and team sports equipment designed to appeal to the GEN-Z customers within each market. We strive to meet the fashion and technical demands of our customers.
Our Growth Strategy
We identify markets for our stores under a clustered expansion program. This approach primarily focuses on opening new stores within close proximity of existing locations, allowing us to take advantage of efficiencies in logistics, marketing and regional management. It also aids us in building a better understanding of appropriate merchandise selection for the local market. In addition to proximity to existing stores, we also consider population, economic conditions, local competitive dynamics, availability of suitable real estate and potential for return on investment when evaluating potential markets.
Omni-channel strategy: We recognize that even though our core customer is in underserved markets, they are digitally savvy. Our customer has high expectations that are constantly evolving including the ability to engage with us in multiple ways. As a result, we continue to make investments in omni-channel as well as our core e-commerce experience. 
Our goal is to provide a completely frictionless digital and omni-channel experience. In essence, this means customers can shop for what they want and can get those items quicker. To achieve this goal, we continue to invest in the user experience for our website and apps and add fulfillment capabilities and speed. In Fiscal 2023, we intend to invest in next generation omni-channel capabilities that will take us beyond traditional retail programs, which will allow us to offer greater shopping flexibility and convenience than ever before.

Our Logistics
We maintain a full-line wholesale and logistics facility in Alabaster, Alabama (a suburb of Birmingham) where we receive and ship most of our merchandise. In addition, we utilize a third-party logistics facility in Memphis, Tennessee to increase efficiencies and to improve time to market. For key products, we maintain backstock at the Alabaster and Memphis facilities. This product is allocated and shipped to stores through an automatic replenishment system based on inventory levels and sales. Merchandise is delivered to stores, and transferred between stores, via small package carriers, Company operated vehicles or third-party logistics providers (which also deliver initial new store inventories). In Fiscal 2021, we increased our delivery frequency to every store in the chain and improved our store-to-store transfer capabilities to further enhance our speed-to-market and in-store product availability for our customers. We believe strong logistics support for our stores is a critical element of our business strategy and that our current logistics structure will support our growth over the next several years.
Our Merchandise
Our merchandising strategy emphasizes a TOE-TO-HEADTM approach. We provide a broad assortment of premium brand name footwear, apparel, accessories and team sports equipment at competitive prices in a full service omni-channel environment. We believe that the assortment of brand name merchandise we offer consistently exceeds the merchandise selection carried by most of our competitors, particularly in our underserved markets and neighborhood centers. Many of these brand name products have limited availability and/or are technical in nature requiring considerable sales assistance. We coordinate with our vendors to educate the sales staff at the store level on new products and trends.
Although the core merchandise assortment tends to be similar for each store, it is somewhat differentiated by the Hibbett or City Gear brands. Each brand utilizes important demographic, local and/or regional considerations. Accordingly, we offer products that reflect preferences for particular demographics as well as interests from each community. Our knowledge of these interests, combined with access to leading brands, enables our merchandising staff to react quickly to emerging trends or special events, such as fashion shifts or athletic events.
Our merchandising staff, operations staff and management analyze current trends primarily through the lens of our store typing strategy. Information is largely gathered and analyzed utilizing business intelligence tools. Other strategic measures we utilize to recognize trends or changes in our industry include:
•maintaining close relationships with vendors and other retailers;
•studying other retailers for best practices in merchandising;
•attending various trade shows, both in our industry and outside as well as reviewing industry trade publications; and
•actively participating in industry associations.
The merchandising staff works closely with store personnel to meet the requirements of individual stores for appropriate merchandise in sufficient quantities.
Our Vendor Relationships
The athletic specialty and city specialty retail businesses are brand-name-driven. Accordingly, we maintain positive relationships with a number of well-known vendors to satisfy customer demand. We believe that we offer a best-in-class omni-channel experience through physical locations, mobile apps and website and that we are among the primary retail distribution avenues for brand name vendors that seek to engage with consumers in underserved markets. As a result, we are able to attract considerable vendor interest and establish long-term partnerships with vendors. As our vendors expand their product lines and grow in popularity, we expand sales of these products. In addition, as we continue to increase our store base and enter new markets, our vendors increase their brand presence within these regions. We also work with our vendors to establish favorable pricing and to receive cooperative marketing funds.

Our Information Systems
We use technology as an enabler of our business strategies. We implement and maintain systems targeted at improving financial control, cost management, inventory control, merchandise planning, logistics, replenishment and product allocation. Our systems are designed to be flexible to meet the unique needs of each specific store location. We continue to evolve our digital channel experience and to develop further channel integration for a more seamless and frictionless set of capabilities aimed at enhancing our customer's shopping experience in-store, online and through our mobile solutions.
Our communications networks send and receive critical business data to and from stores, third-party cloud providers and managed hosting facilities (data centers). Our Company’s information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets. We attempt to mitigate the risk of cyber-security threats and business interruptions by maintaining strong security protocols, threat monitoring, regular risk reviews and a detailed disaster recovery plan. In early Fiscal 2021, we consolidated the City Gear data center into our St. Louis hosted facility, which accomplished the alignment of controls over data. We completed the integration of all core systems during Fiscal 2021.
We strive to maintain highly qualified and motivated third-party partners and teams of individuals to support our information systems, which includes security, help desk, network, platform engineering, operations, quality assurance, compliance, business analysis, solution development, analytics and project management. Our systems are monitored 24 hours a day, and management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will continue to support current needs and future growth. We use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning and enterprise risk management. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business criteria.
Our Marketing and Promotion
We focus on marketing opportunities that drive traffic and sales to our stores and digital business. For the last few years, digital marketing has been the major growth area for our marketing investments. We continue to see opportunities in personalization as well as hyper-local marketing efforts, including events and local store social media accounts. We have also maintained more traditional elements of our portfolio to drive store traffic. 
Our Rewards program represented a significant portion of overall sales in Fiscal 2022. Loyalty sales increased in Fiscal 2022, driven by the relaunch of our existing loyalty program and expansion of the program into our City Gear stores. In Fiscal 2023, we intend to continue to improve our Rewards program to drive member acquisition and retention.
Our Competition
The business in which we are engaged is highly competitive. The marketplace for athletic specialty merchandise is highly fragmented as many different brick and mortar and online retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of formats and merchandising strategies. We compete with specialty shoe stores, department stores, traditional shoe stores, mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers and, in some of our large and mid-size markets, national sporting goods superstores. In addition, we face competition from vendors that sell directly to consumers.
Although we face competition from a variety of competitors, we believe that our stores are able to compete effectively by providing a premium assortment of footwear, apparel, accessories and team sports equipment. Additionally, we differentiate our store experience through extensive product knowledge, customer service and convenient locations. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors in the underserved markets and neighborhood centers predominantly in the South, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the United States.

Human Capital
Human Capital Management
At Hibbett, our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. Our inclusive culture inspires leadership, encourages innovative thinking and supports advancement opportunities for all team members. Our human resources programs are central to our long-term strategy and are designed to develop talent in preparation for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support team members through competitive pay and benefits; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; engage team members as brand ambassadors of the Company’s products and experiences; and evolve and invest in technology, tools and resources to enable team members at work.
As of January 29, 2022, we employed approximately 11,000 team members, of which approximately 3,600 were full-time team members and over 92% of the total population work in our retail locations. None of our team members are represented by a labor union. The number of full-time and part-time team members fluctuates depending on seasonal needs. We have a long history of providing competitive compensation and benefits and providing meaningful experiences and career-development opportunities to our team members. As a result, we have not experienced significant interruptions in our operations due to labor disagreements or team member dissatisfaction. 
COVID-19
We are committed to the health and safety of our team members and their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we supported our team members by expanding remote work, broadening benefit offerings such as increasing paid-time-off for our retail team members and providing health care premium forgiveness. Our Chief Executive Officer has provided updates to our team members, including field leadership, every month since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and we offer Associate Assistance Program counseling sessions to assist with team member needs.
Our Diversity and Inclusion Statement:
-10-


Index

Diversity, inclusion and belonging are at the heart of who we are as a Company. We’ve cultivated an authentic representation of our communities through thoughtful local hiring, often from our customer base. Our teams’ unique backgrounds, perspectives and skills improve us all, creating a competitive advantage that positively impacts our business and contributes to our success. We intentionally foster a culture of belonging and inspiring self-expression in our team members and our customers.
We are committed to doing our part to improve our inclusion and increase our diversity. We are driving important change through specific actions, including continuing our relationship with the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at the University of Alabama at Birmingham to provide diversity and inclusion education sessions. In addition, we have fostered a culture where team members are encouraged and empowered to be leaders through our Leadership Academy professional development program and we recently formed our first employee resource group focused on supporting and engaging women in our workforce. 
Talent Acquisition/Talent Development/Team Member Engagement
Investing in our team members is one of our core strategies. We aim to provide best-in-class training and development opportunities, while creating innovative programs that enable a vibrant and engaged learning culture to flourish. In addition to our Leadership Academy, we utilize LinkedIn Learning as our e-learning platform, and we introduced a professional development series consisting of various monthly educational sessions for leadership positions at our Store Support Center. We also support and encourage continued education with a competitive tuition reimbursement program for our team members.
We recognize that maintaining an inclusive and high-performance culture requires an engaged workforce, where team members are motivated to do their best work every day. Our engagement approach centers on communication and recognition. We communicate with our team members in a variety of ways, including monthly live CEO updates that include Q&A sessions with team members and regular communications to all our retail locations. We conduct periodic team member engagement surveys at our Store Support Center to understand and respond to team member needs. In February 2022, we expanded our annual survey company-wide to provide all team members a channel for feedback on a variety of topics, including company direction and strategy, individual growth and development, diversity, health and well-being and meaningful work. 
We continuously strive to be an employer of choice. In 2021, Forbes recognized Hibbett as one of "America’s Best Employers", “Best Employers for Diversity,” “Best Employers for Women,” “America’s Best Employers for New Grads” and “America’s Best Employers by State.” 
Community and Social Impact - Building Connections
We believe that building connections between our team members, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling, and enjoyable workplace. We are committed to providing comfort to those in need through our ongoing relationship with the United Way of Central Alabama. Team members make contributions to this organization that supports 71 partner agencies, and we match 100% of all team member contributions. We support a number of organizations through financial and in-kind giving, including the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Children’s Hospital of Alabama, Alabama Sheriff’s Youth Ranch, UAB O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Jefferson County, Alabama Board of Education. Our retail store team members engage with local community partners across our vast store footprint by hosting events such as free haircuts for back to school and holiday food drives. 
SOLE SCHOOL® is the main focus for community engagement in our local retail districts. In Fiscal 2022, we partnered with over 85 schools, one school from each Hibbett and City Gear sales districts, to participate in the program. Highlights of SOLE SCHOOL® include product donations, engagement programs, career coaching, academic incentives and monetary donations. Our retail team members lead focus groups where student athletes are encouraged to excel in school and are introduced to various career paths that may be available to them after high school and college. Additionally, the student athletes get a first look at some of the newest product releases and selections and can provide feedback, potentially influencing future product selection.
At our Store Support Center, we continue our partnership with Holy Family Cristo Rey High School, an organization that supports inner-city education for students from families of limited economic means. Students participated in a Corporate Work-Study Program to gain real-world work experience at our corporate headquarters. We also support our local disabled community through our partnership with United Ability of Alabama and its Job Exploration Training Services ("JETS") program. Through the JETS program, we enabled 10 high school students with varying abilities to receive on-the-job training, mentoring and work experience at our Wholesale and Logistics Facility. 
Environmental Sustainability
-11-


Index

We have recently partnered with a third party to develop a science-based methodology of measuring, monitoring and reporting on sustainability. Our current focus is on reduction of waste and sustainable product offerings. We also understand the importance of reducing our energy consumption and aim to monitor and report on our efforts in the future.
Our LED Lighting Initiative, which we adopted in 2016, reduces store energy use by about 30%, and the majority of our stores are either fully or partially supplied with LED lights. Other energy efficient initiatives such as upgrades of our older HVAC units have further reduced our energy use.
Additionally, we aim to divert waste from landfills by increasing our existing recycling programs. In order to reduce waste, we recycle corrugated boxes and strive to reuse cartons and pallets in our logistics facility. Our recycling efforts are further complemented by our shopping bags, which contain 15% of recycled materials.
Finally, we continue to collaborate with certain vendors to increase sustainable product offerings. We support Nike's Move to Zero®, a closed-loop process that uses manufacturing scrap, unsellable products, and worn-out shoes to make new products, by significant marketing and social media effort and in-store displays. We also offer other sustainable products from a number of other vendors, and we expect to increase sustainable product offerings in the future.

In addition, our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of new store openings, the amount and timing of net sales contributed by new stores, weather fluctuations, merchandise mix, demand for merchandise driven by local interest in sporting events and the timing of sales tax holidays and annual tax refunds.
