 Operations:
 The management is changing the direction of the Company to be a product development and marketing company. The Company is in the process of developing a line of products for camping, travel and emergency, all of which will be marketed under a company logo.
 As a part of the program, the Company is designing a lightweight travel, camping and emergency trailer, which encompasses a number of extra features that will make it unique in the industry.
 The trailer, unlike most trailers, is a one-wheel (swivel-wheel) trailer that is versatile, capable of being towed by any size of vehicle, from a large van to a small Volkswagen Bug or other small cars. It is designed to be very different from camper trailers that are presently on the market. Not to be a sleeper trailer, and yet, with the adaption of a specially made tent attachment, can accommodate sleeping arrangements. There will be several different models.
 A single wheel trailer is a trailer that has only one wheel supporting it with a rigid attachment to the vehicle. Unlike traditional trailers with a ball pivot, the single swivel wheel trailer always tracks with the tow vehicle, acting more like an extension of the vehicle.
 The trailer is usually fitted with a two-power hitch, which is attached to the tow vehicle at a standard Class-III or Class-IV, 2x2 receiver on the vehicle.

With the swivel wheel, the trailer does not swing from side to side and does not fishtail or jackknife like most trailers. When backing and turning, the trailer stays straight with the tow vehicle and the wheel swivels around to the direction of the motion.
 In one model of the trailer, there will be an assortment of emergency type of items such as the following:
 
1. | Our emergency kit containing 17 very important items for travel, camping and emergency use 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | First Aid Kit containing 299 items for camping or emergency or when traveling 
3. | Water purifier kit  small and convenient but excellent for camping or emergency or travel 
4. | Emergency Reflectors - 3 large reflectors for emergency use

7. | Camp Table  lightweight and strong 3-Fold N Half Aluminum Table 
8. | Folding Camp chairs - 2 each-lightweight but compact and strong  2 in each trailer 
9. | Portable camp toilet /camping commode  for camping and emergency use 
10. | Collapsible Water bucket  for camping and emergency use. Folds to 2 and holds up to 3 gallons 
11. | Waterproof folding Toilet Paper Storage Cylinder Case for keeping toilet paper handy and dry. 
12. | Tarp - Large Multi-Purpose, waterproof, heavy duty poly tarp 
13. | Portable battery powered shower  This battery powered shower for showering from a bucket of water.

 The Company has researched possible venders for components for the trailer and all items that would be included in the basic model of the trailer.
 Covid-19 Pandemic.
 We do not believe that the Covid-19 pandemic will have a material on the operations of the Company.
 Competition
 There are many different camp trailers, work trailers, emergency kits, etc. which we consider competition. However, none offers the same diverse options that the Company intends to offer through the Model SW-A1 trailer.
 There are many types and models of small camping trailers manufactured and sold in the US and throughout the world. Most of these trailers have some type of sleeping accommodations, either inside the trailer or creating sleeping quarters with a pop up or fold out system, usually for two people.
 A tent trailer is one where the tent itself takes up the entire trailer bed, thus allowing for little else to be transported in the trailer. Other camping trailers are designed to be small sleep trailers only.
 A number of companies make tent trailers that pop up out of a trailer bed, while others make small sleeping trailers like the Tear Drop models. Lees-ure Lite, out of British Columbia, is a good example. They make a variety of pop-up tent two-wheel trailers. After extensive research, we could find nothing that competed directly with our Model SW-A1 type of trailer.
 Management is not aware of any trailers that are similar to the Model SW-A1 trailer.
 There is no assurance that we will be able to compete with the existing trailer and emergency kit manufacturers and new event centers that may be built in the future.
 Many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us including:
 
● | Longer operating histories and greater market presence, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------
● | Better name recognition,

● | Access to larger customer bases, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Economies of scale and cost structure advantages, and 
● | Greater sales and marketing, programming, distribution, technical, financial and other resources. 

These competitors also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or third parties. In addition, some of our competitors have used or may use aggressive pricing or promotional strategies, have stronger relationships on more favorable terms with retail outlets. These relationships may affect the ability of potential customers to purchase our products.
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. The majority of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we plan to operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for facilities and personnel than our financial resources permit.
 Pricing
 After extensive research of the market for trailers and for the emergency items that would be included, we believe that we can be competitive in pricing of our product.
Technology
 We currently have no technology that differs from any other company in our field. We do not believe technology will separate our business from other competitors; rather our focus will be on the uniqueness of our event center and our marketing programs.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts, including Duration
 We have no patents or trademarks. We also have no franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts.
 Employees and Independent Contractors
 Our only employee is our President, Phil E. Ray, who currently devotes 25 - 30 hours per month to company matters. After receiving funding or a substantial increase in revenues, Mr. Ray plans to devote as much time as the board of directors determines is necessary to manage the affairs of the Company. There are no formal employment agreements between the Company and Mr. Ray.
Reports to Security Holders
 We are a smaller reporting company and will comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act. We will file annual, quarterly and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we will not be required to deliver our annual or quarterly reports to security holders, we intend to forward this information to security holders upon receiving a written request to receive such information. The reports and other information filed by us will be available for inspection and copying at the public reference facilities of the Securities and Exchange Commission located at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
 Copies of such material may be obtained by mail from the Public Reference Section of the Securities and Exchange Commission at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, at prescribed rates. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the Commission maintains a website at: http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 General Information
 We are considered a startup company and have not generated revenues and have a short operating history. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion, which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
 Our plan is to attempt to continue with our business plan of developing a unique trailer with numerous accessories.
 Our focus for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 will be to raise additional capital, more research as to the overall concept and contacting companies that could be possible venders to the Company. We will also be searching for other business opportunities in the event we cannot raise additional capital and move ahead with our business plan.
