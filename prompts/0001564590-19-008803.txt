Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage messenger RNA, or mRNA, therapeutics company developing a new class of potentially transformative medicines to treat diseases caused by protein or gene dysfunction. Using our proprietary mRNA therapeutic platform, or MRT platform, we create mRNA that encodes functional proteins. We believe that the mRNA design, delivery and manufacturing capabilities of our MRT platform provide us with the most advanced platform for developing product candidates that deliver mRNA encoding functional proteins for therapeutic uses. Our mRNA is delivered to the target cell where the cell’s own machinery recognizes it and translates it, restoring or augmenting protein function to treat or prevent disease. We believe that our MRT platform is broadly applicable across multiple diseases in which the production of a desirable protein can have a therapeutic effect. We are initially focused on restoring the expression of intracellular and transmembrane proteins, areas that have eluded conventional protein therapeutics, in patients with genetic diseases where there is high unmet medical need. 
 We are developing our lead MRT product candidate for the lung, MRT5005, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF. We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MRT5005 and anticipate reporting interim data from this trial 
in the second half of 2019. We are developing our lead MRT product candidate for the liver, MRT5201, for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase, or OTC, deficiency
. In December 2018, we submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, for MRT5201, 
which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has placed on clinical hold
. The FDA is requiring additional preclinical toxicology data. We have identified the 
additional preclinical studies required, and plan to complete these studies and submit a response to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019. We believe that our MRT platform is distinct from other mRNA-based technologies and has the potential to provide clinical benefits by transforming life-threatening illnesses into manageable chronic conditions. 
 mRNA plays a central role in the production of proteins, which are needed to carry out essential cellular functions. mRNA transcribes genetic information encoded in DNA into instructions that are used by cells to produce proteins. mRNA therapy is engineered to deliver mRNA encoding natural, functional proteins that replace defective or missing proteins, and has potential advantages, including that it: 
  
• | restores gene expression without entering the cell nucleus or changing the genome;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enables the treatment of diseases that were previously undruggable by using the cell’s own machinery to produce natural and fully functional proteins;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | has drug-like properties that are familiar to health care providers, including the potential to repeat and adjust dosing in a chronic setting; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | permits rapid development from target gene selection to product candidate.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our product candidates consist of two major components: the protein-coding mRNA and a delivery vehicle. Once we have established delivery capability to a target tissue, we can design new product candidates that vary only in the mRNA sequence, which we expect will allow for rapid target and development candidate identification. We believe that this will enable our MRT platform to be flexible and scalable as we develop additional product candidates. We engineer our mRNA sequences for enhanced stability and to provide for optimal expression of desired proteins. Our mRNA is manufactured by a proprietary, cell-free, enzyme catalyzed process using structural components that are identical to natural mRNA within the body. We then formulate the product candidate by packaging our biosynthetic mRNA into proprietary lipid-based nanoparticle, or LNP, delivery vehicles that are optimized for distribution to specific tissues. We are initially focused on the development of product candidates to treat diseases of the lung and liver. We also believe that our platform has the potential to apply across a broad array of diseases and target tissues. In our preclinical studies, we have observed targeted delivery to the eye, central nervous system, or CNS, lymphatic system and circulatory system, as well as the ability of our platform to enable the production of antibodies. Additionally, we have observed significant improvements in mRNA potency and delivery when compared to prior generations of our mRNA technology as well as competing approaches.

Our MRT platform has been in development for over 10 years, initially at Shire Human Genetic Therapies, Inc., or Shire, a subsidiary of Shire plc. We acquired the MRT platform from Shire in December 2016 and have dedicated substantial resources to the further development of the platform and product candidates. The scientific founders of the MRT platform who were responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and delivery know-how and intellectual property supporting this platform joined our company as part of the acquisition. We have been building upon Shire’s pioneering work and significant investment by advancing our product candidates towards clinical trials. We believe these efforts have positioned us as a leading company in mRNA therapeutic development worldwide. 
 We are developing our lead MRT product candidate for the lung, MRT5005, for the treatment of patients with CF, which is the most common fatal inherited disease in the United States. CF affects approximately 30,000 patients in the United States and a total of more than 70,000 patients worldwide and leads to premature death. CF is caused by genetic mutations that result in dysfunctional or absent cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, protein. CF results in mucus buildup in the lungs, pancreas and other organs, and mortality is primarily driven by a progressive decline in lung function. There remains a large unmet medical need in the CF patient population as currently approved CFTR modulating therapies are limited to patients with specific genetic mutations and patients treated with these therapies still suffer from long-term decline in lung function and exacerbations that require hospitalization. 
 We believe MRT5005 is the first clinical-stage mRNA product candidate designed to deliver mRNA encoding fully functional CFTR protein to the lung. MRT5005 is being developed to treat all patients with CF, regardless of the underlying genetic mutation. This broad applicability is in contrast to CFTR protein modulators currently marketed or in clinical development, which are only effective in a subset of patients with specific genetic mutations, including those with limited or no CFTR protein. 
 We have designed MRT5005 to be inhaled via a handheld nebulizer and to be administered in a once-weekly dose. Once the inhaled MRT5005 has entered the epithelial cells lining the patient’s lungs, our therapeutic mRNA uses the cells’ own machinery for translation and expression of fully functional CFTR protein, thereby restoring this essential ion channel, which we believe will address the pathology of CF directly. In our preclinical studies we have observed dose-dependent increases in CFTR being restored to cell membranes and that the inhaled formulation of MRT5005 resulted in broad CFTR expression in lung tissue. We have initiated a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 clinical trial of MRT5005 in which we plan to enroll at least 32 patients with CF. In late May 2018, we began enrolling and dosing patients in the single-ascending dose part of this trial. In January 2019, we announced that we received approval from the Protocol Safety Review Committee to initiate the multiple-ascending dose, or MAD, portion of the trial and in February 2019, we announced that dosing of patients in the MAD portion of the trial had begun. We anticipate reporting interim data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the second half of 2019. In 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to MRT5005 for the treatment of CF. 
 We are advancing our lead MRT product candidate for the liver, MRT5201, for the treatment of patients with OTC deficiency, a metabolic liver enzyme disorder that results from a mutation in the OTC gene. OTC deficiency is the most common urea cycle disorder. This enzyme is an intracellular protein necessary for preventing the accumulation of ammonia, a normal byproduct of protein breakdown. When the enzyme is defective or absent, high levels of ammonia accumulate in the blood, which can cause serious and irreversible neurological damage. The incidence of OTC deficiency is estimated to be 1 in 56,500 live births in the United States. 
 We have designed MRT5201 for intravenous delivery of mRNA encoding fully functional OTC enzyme to the liver to enable hepatocytes, the predominant type of liver cell, to produce normal OTC enzyme. We expect that sufficient expression of the functional OTC enzyme in hepatocytes would reduce or eliminate the need for current treatments such as strict low-protein diets or ammonia scavengers. We have conducted preclinical studies in OTC-deficient mice in which we have observed delivery of MRT5201 and expression of functionally active human OTC in the mouse liver. Furthermore, MRT5201 was observed to normalize levels of urinary orotic acid, a biomarker of the disease, in these mice and render them resistant to the introduction of ammonia from outside the body for up to four weeks
. In December 2018, we submitted an IND to the FDA to support the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for MRT5201 in patients with OTC deficiency. Subsequently, the FDA notified us that our IND for MRT5201 was placed on clinical hold. Prior to initiation of our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial, the FDA is requiring additional preclinical toxicology data to assess the potential for adverse effects related to the clearance time of MRT5201. We have identified the additional preclinical studies required, and plan to complete these studies and submit a response to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019. In 2018, MRT5201 was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of OTC deficiency in the United States and European Union.

In addition to genetic diseases of the lung and liver, we continue to explore other tissues where we believe we can leverage the broad applicability of our MRT platform across multiple diseases in which the production of desirable protein can have a therapeutic effect. 
 Beyond our two lead product candidates, we continue to advance our discovery-stage programs and our mRNA technology. We intend to leverage the broad applicability of our MRT platform through our collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur Inc., or Sanofi, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi S.A., to develop infectious disease vaccines using mRNA technology, or mRNA vaccines, for up to five infectious disease pathogens. 
 Our technology and products are protected by an extensive intellectual property portfolio, including issued patents and pending patent applications covering mRNA sequences, lipids and polymer composition of matter, manufacturing, specific targets, disease treatments, and formulation and delivery technology. We continue to innovate to improve both the mRNA constructs as well as the delivery technology involved in creating our MRT product candidates. 
 Going Concern
 We have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $144.1 million. 
Based 
on our 
recurring losses and cash outflows from operations since inception, expectation of continuing operating losses and cash outflows from operations for the foreseeable future and the 
need to raise additional capital to finance our 
future operations, we 
have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For a further discussion of our liquidity, please refer to Part II, Item 7 of this report under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Funding Requirements” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our Pipeline 
 Our proprietary MRT platform has been designed with the potential to apply across a broad array of diseases and target tissues and through multiple routes of administration. The following chart summarizes key information about our two lead product candidates and programs: 



In addition to the programs above, we have several discovery-stage programs focused on treating diseases that potentially can be addressed by delivery of mRNA to the lung, liver, eye, CNS and lymphatic system. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to continue building a leading, global mRNA therapeutics company that capitalizes on our extensive experience with proprietary mRNA product development, delivery, manufacturing and process development. Our proprietary MRT platform has enabled us to focus on direct therapeutic approaches to treat specific genetic diseases with high unmet medical need. We are leveraging our platform’s broad applicability and believe that our first-in-class MRT product candidates in CF and OTC deficiency have the potential to transform these debilitating and life-threatening illnesses into manageable chronic conditions with an improved quality of life.

 The Role of mRNA 
 mRNA is a fundamental component of gene expression. It is the key link in the process of translating genetic information encoded in DNA into instructions that are used by cells to produce the proteins needed to carry out essential cellular functions. These instructions are processed through cellular mechanisms in two steps: transcription and translation. During transcription, a gene that encodes an amino acid sequence for a particular protein is transcribed into a complementary sequence of mRNA. The mRNA then carries these instructions to other areas of the cell where the instructions are translated by ribosomes, which are specialized molecular machines within cells that carry out protein synthesis. During transcription, the ribosomes use the instructions conveyed by mRNA as a template for assembling the amino acids to create the desired protein. The following graphic illustrates the transcription and translation processes. 
 

7

Abnormal gene expression, caused by a mutation in a DNA sequence, can result in the transcription of defective instructions. The translation of defective instructions by the cell can lead to the failure to produce, insufficient production or over production of a protein, or the production of dysfunctional proteins. This protein defect is the underlying cause of genetic disease. 
 There are several existing treatment approaches that seek to address the underlying cause of the absent or defective proteins associated with genetic disorders, including protein replacement therapy, gene therapy, gene editing and small molecule therapies. However, each has important limitations. 
 Existing Treatment Approaches and Their Limitations 
 Protein Replacement Therapy 
 Protein replacement therapy seeks to supplement or replace absent or deficient proteins or enzymes. While this approach has been used successfully to treat a subset of protein-based disorders, it is most effective if the protein carries out its function outside the cell. However, a majority of genetic disorders involve intracellular or transmembrane proteins, which carry out their function inside the cell. These proteins are significantly more challenging to replace. 
Gene Therapy 
 Gene therapy is the process of introducing a functional copy of a defective gene sequence into a patient’s cells to express the desired protein. However, some current gene therapy approaches do not efficiently integrate this functional genetic sequence into the genome, while other approaches randomly integrate thereby causing safety concerns. The failure to efficiently integrate results in the functional genetic sequence not being effectively passed to new cells following cell division. As a result, in genetic disorders that involve dividing cells, such as epithelial cells of the lung, the efficacy of gene therapy may be limited. Repeated gene therapy treatments may be required to effectively treat such disorders. However, the ability to provide repeated treatments is limited by current gene therapy’s reliance on the delivery through a viral vector, which is an engineered virus that is designed to express genes of interest and results in serious challenges concerning safety and immunogenicity, such as neutralizing antibodies. The success of this approach is further limited by difficulties in delivering the therapy to the cell nucleus, which is a crucial step to ensure ultimate expression of the desired therapeutic protein. The cost of manufacturing gene therapy product candidates in large scale is also significant. 
Gene Editing 
 Gene editing seeks to permanently replace, delete or repair a defective gene sequence at the natural gene location in a patient’s genome. In contrast to gene therapy, an edited genetic sequence would be replicated in new cells following cell division, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for repeat dosing. However, current methods of gene editing face significant limitations, including unwanted on- and off-target modifications to DNA, failure to make the intended modification, challenges in introducing the particular edit into the cell nucleus, and manufacturing complexities. There are currently no approved gene editing products, and there is limited clinical experience with this approach. 
Small Molecule Therapy 
 In small molecule therapy, small molecules are designed to bind to disease-associated molecules and modulate their activity. Small molecule approaches to genetic disorders have limitations, including the inability to directly address specific gene defects and the potential to cause off-target toxicities. 
 mRNA Therapy 
 mRNA therapy has long been of interest because of its potential to overcome many of the shortcomings of existing approaches. The goal of mRNA therapy is to provide the instructions needed for cells to produce functional proteins through the cells’ own machinery. mRNA does not integrate into or alter the genome, which may offer a better safety profile than gene therapy, gene editing or small molecule therapy. Because mRNA is a natural component of all cells, it is inherently biocompatible. As such, mRNA therapy offers the ability to titrate and dose repeatedly. The central role of mRNA in protein expression confers the potential for mRNA therapy to have broad applicability across multiple diseases in which the production of a desirable protein can have a therapeutic effect. 
 8

However, the potential of mRNA therapy has been unrealized due to the following key challenges: 
  
• | Stability: mRNA is susceptible to rapid degradation by nucleases, including ribonuclease, or RNase, which can limit the duration of the therapeutic effect.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immunogenicity: An effective therapeutic mRNA must be pure and in a form not recognized by the body as foreign to avoid triggering an immune response.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Delivery: Therapeutic mRNA must be safely and effectively delivered across the cell membranes of the target tissues without off-target toxicity and degradation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manufacture of mRNA Products: It is difficult to achieve scalable and cost-effective manufacturing of stable and non-immunogenic therapeutic mRNA in quantities sufficient to support clinical trials and commercial production.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our scientific expertise and years of investment in mRNA construct design, delivery and manufacturing have allowed us to overcome many challenges that have limited the development of mRNA therapy. 
 Our MRT Platform 
 Our MRT platform has enabled us to develop product candidates designed to deliver mRNA that can carry instructions to produce intracellular, transmembrane and secreted proteins. Our platform is also designed to be flexible and scalable by allowing for the development of MRT product candidates that vary only in the mRNA sequence and the tissue-specific delivery vehicle. This modular nature of our platform may allow us to rapidly advance into new indications after successfully establishing delivery vehicles for specific tissues. For example, we are utilizing our MRT platform to identify and rapidly develop new product candidates designed to address the underlying causes of additional diseases of the lung and liver. 
 As depicted below, mRNA directly provides the instructions for the body to produce proteins. Our MRT product candidates are designed to enter the cell and unpackage our therapeutic mRNA in the cytoplasm. Upon release of the mRNA, the ribosomes in the cell engage the mRNA and begin the translation process, resulting in the production of the desired natural protein. This process of translation is designed to continue until the mRNA is expended.

Advantages of our MRT Platform 
 We believe that our proprietary MRT platform and the design of our product candidates, which consist of the protein-coding mRNA and a delivery vehicle, will enable us to overcome the challenges of mRNA therapy and allow for chronic dosing of our MRT product candidates for the following reasons: 
  
• | Enhanced Stability. Our mRNA design, manufacturing processes and nanoparticle formulations are designed to protect our mRNA from degradation by nucleases, including RNase, and by chemical or physical forces, in order to achieve the appropriate duration of therapeutic effect.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Targeting Lower Immunogenicity. We use manufacturing processes to remove impurities and we design our mRNA using structural components that are identical to natural mRNA within the body, thereby potentially reducing the risk of stimulating an immune response.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tissue-Specific Delivery. Our delivery technology is designed for efficient encapsulation and cellular uptake in target tissues, thereby reducing the risk of degradation, off-target toxicity and unwanted stimulation of the immune system.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalable and Flexible Manufacturing. We employ a unique, biosynthetic, cell-free process to manufacture pure, high-quality mRNA and delivery vehicles with significant potency at a scale suitable for clinical trials and that is designed to be scaled to support commercial production.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mRNA Construct Design 
 Delivering the desired mRNA sequences is the first step to restoring healthy function to proteins. In our preclinical studies, we observed that such mRNA sequences, when flanked by proprietary signaling sequences and packaged into our delivery vehicles, entered cells and restored proper cellular protein production. 
 We design our proprietary mRNA sequences to encode the natural protein sequences. We use unmodified mRNA bases to replicate the composition and function of endogenous mRNA. We then further optimize the sequences to result in efficient protein production. We achieve this optimization through the selection of appropriate transcription and translational control elements to maximize protein expression across a broad range of tissues. 
 Delivery 
 After we create the desired mRNA sequences, we then package our mRNA sequences into delivery vehicles, such as our LNPs, that are customized for delivery to specific tissues. We design our delivery vehicles for optimal size, surface charge and lipid composition. 
 For example, MRT5005 is intended to address the underlying cause of CF, and thus we use a lipid composition and particle size designed specifically to deliver mRNA to the lung by inhalation. By contrast, MRT5201, which is administered intravenously, is intended to address the underlying cause of OTC deficiency, and thus its lipid composition and particle size are designed specifically to deliver mRNA into hepatocytes. 
 We intend to apply our delivery expertise gained in the development of our lead MRT product candidates to the design, optimization and manufacturing of new MRT product candidates. 
 Our LNPs are designed to have low immunogenicity, meaning that they are intended to avoid stimulating the body’s natural response to exogenous therapies, thereby preventing the formation of antibodies which can neutralize exogenous therapeutic products and dramatically decrease their efficacy. Neutralizing antibodies pose a major limitation to gene therapies and related approaches. In preclinical studies, we have not observed any neutralizing antibody effect towards our MRT product candidates and have observed continued therapeutic benefits after repeat administrations. Because we can dose our MRT product candidates repeatedly, we expect to be able to titrate dosing to the minimally effective dose to maximize patient-specific therapeutic benefit. The ability to dose repeatedly may also allow us to treat cells that routinely turn over in the body, such as epithelial cells in the lungs. 
 Manufacturing 
 Through years of investment, we have established current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, of our mRNA drug substance. We have developed proprietary processes that reproducibly provide sufficient quantities of highly pure, high-quality and highly potent mRNA to support our clinical trials. We have made extensive efforts to develop analytical assays to allow for complete characterization of the mRNA drug substance. These assays allow us to demonstrate the quality and potency of the resulting mRNA drug substance. We believe that our manufacturing processes successfully address key issues commonly associated with the manufacturing of mRNA, such as poor capping at one end of the mRNA sequence and the extensive presence of prematurely terminated sequences, such as double-stranded RNA and other contaminants. 
 The modular nature of our mRNA drug substance manufacturing processes allows for versatility by using the same core production and purification processes for any mRNA drug substance. We only change the sequence of the coding region for the desired mRNA candidate to produce a new mRNA drug substance. Further, we believe that our manufacturing process is cost-effective and minimizes development costs associated with a new mRNA drug substance because, unlike other treatment approaches, it does not require new cell line development or a new production and purification process for each new MRT product candidate. 
 We have also established cGMP manufacturing of the LNP drug product, which is the delivery vehicle containing the mRNA drug substance. We have developed a proprietary process to produce high-quality, highly potent and stable LNPs that encapsulate our mRNA drug substance. We have designed our LNP drug product to facilitate cellular uptake as well as provide stability, including against degradation by nucleases, such as RNase. We have designed a large-scale cGMP manufacturing process for our LNP drug products that we believe can support our clinical trials and is readily scalable. We have made extensive efforts to develop analytical assays to allow for complete characterization of the LNP final drug product and to allow us to demonstrate the quality and potency of the final LNP drug product. 
 Similar to our mRNA manufacturing, our LNP manufacturing process utilizes a modular approach that we believe will be cost-effective and will minimize development costs associated with each new mRNA drug substance. 
 11

Broad Applicability of our MRT Platform 
 We believe that our MRT platform may be applied across a broad array of diseases and target tissues via multiple routes of administration. In addition to the inhalation and intravenous administration employed for our two lead programs for the treatment of CF and OTC deficiency, respectively, we have observed successful production of the desired proteins through other routes of administration in preclinical studies, which may allow us to develop MRT product candidates for the treatment of a wide range of rare and non-rare diseases, including CNS disorders and ocular diseases. We believe our platform may also be applied to produce therapeutic antibodies and vaccines in areas such as infectious disease and oncology. 
 We intend to leverage the broad applicability of our MRT platform beyond its current therapeutic applications through the pursuit of strategic collaborations that we expect will enable us to develop our platform in non-core areas. We entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi to develop mRNA vaccines for up to five infectious disease pathogens. The agreement became effective in July 2018. 
 Under the agreement, we and Sanofi have agreed to jointly conduct research and development activities to advance mRNA vaccines during a three-year research term, which may be extended by mutual agreement. The agreement provides for Sanofi to make an upfront payment to us of $45.0 million, which we received in July 2018. The agreement provides that we are eligible to receive aggregate potential payments of up to $805.0 million from Sanofi, which includes the $45.0 million upfront payment, certain development, regulatory and sales-related milestone payments across several vaccine targets as well as option exercise payments if Sanofi exercises its options related to development of vaccines for additional pathogens. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalty payments on worldwide net sales of mRNA vaccines. Sanofi is responsible for costs during the research term, and we have granted Sanofi exclusive worldwide commercialization rights. We will be responsible for clinical manufacture and will be entitled to additional payments under a separate supply agreement to be entered into by the parties. 
 Vaccines work by mimicking disease-causing agents to stimulate the immune system, building up a defense mechanism that can be deployed to fight future infections. mRNA vaccines offer an innovative approach by delivering the nucleotide sequence encoding a protein associated with prevention or treatment of a pathogen. Because of their high potency, capacity for rapid development and potential for low-cost manufacture and safe administration, we believe that mRNA vaccines represent a potentially innovative alternative to conventional vaccine approaches. The same production process to manufacture mRNA designed to create desired protein for our product candidates can be used to manufacture different mRNA for vaccines, which we believe provides flexibility in development and potentially enables the development of vaccines for disease areas where vaccination is not yet a viable option.

We have discovery-stage programs to identify additional mRNA product candidates in the below areas: 


Our Programs 
 Lead Program for the Lung: MRT5005 
 Our lead MRT product candidate for the lung, MRT5005, is designed to address the underlying cause of CF by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional CFTR protein to the lung epithelial cells through nebulization. In preclinical studies, successful delivery of MRT5005 resulted in the production of fully functional CFTR protein. According to research from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, the average number of copies of human CFTR mRNA is approximately one or two per cell. We believe that we can provide therapeutic levels of human CFTR mRNA because MRT5005 is designed to efficiently deliver human CFTR mRNA to the lung with widespread distribution. 
 There is a large unmet medical need in the CF patient population as the currently approved therapies are limited to patients with specific genetic mutations and patients treated with these therapies still suffer from long-term decline in lung function and exacerbations that require hospitalization. MRT5005 has the potential to treat all patients suffering from CF, regardless of the mutations present. Our goal for MRT5005 is to provide patients with significant improvements in lung function, halt the progressive decline in lung function and substantially reduce the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations. 
 We believe MRT5005 is the first clinical-stage mRNA product candidate designed to deliver mRNA encoding fully functional CFTR protein to lung epithelial cells. We have initiated a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 clinical trial of MRT5005 in which we plan to enroll at least 32 patients with CF. In late May 2018, we began enrolling and dosing patients in the single-ascending dose part of this trial. In January 2019, we announced that we received approval from the Protocol Safety Review Committee to initiate the MAD portion of the trial and in February 2019, we announced that dosing of patients in the MAD portion of the trial had begun. We anticipate reporting interim data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the second half of 2019.
 Cystic Fibrosis 
 CF is the most common fatal inherited disease in the United States. CF results in mucus buildup in the lungs, pancreas and other organs, and mortality is primarily driven by a progressive decline in lung function. There is no cure for CF. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, or CFF, the median age at death for patients with CF in the United States was 30.6 years in 2017. According to the CFF, approximately 30,000 patients in the United States and more than 70,000 patients worldwide are living with CF and approximately 900 new cases of CF are diagnosed each year. Patients with CF experience frequent pulmonary exacerbations, chronic infections and persistent inflammation, all of which may require outpatient doctor visits and hospitalizations. In some severe cases, these patients require lung transplants. The quality of life for patients with CF is severely compromised and requires significant self-care time, including life-long treatment with multiple daily medications, use of nebulizers and physiotherapy. 
 CF is caused by dysfunctional or missing CFTR protein. The CFTR protein functions as a channel that regulates the movement of chloride ions in and out of the cells of organs such as the lungs, pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract. Through regulation of these ions, the amount of salts in the fluid both inside and outside of the cell remains balanced. When CFTR protein expels the ions, water is drawn out of cells and hydrates the cell surface. In patients with CF, the CFTR protein is defective and cannot perform its normal function of transporting ions across the cell membrane, resulting in an environment characterized by thick mucus on affected cellular 
 13

surfaces. The deficiency in CFTR protein activity in patients with CF is particularly problematic in the lungs, where the build-up of thick mucus obstructs air flow and provides a favorable environment for bacteria, which leads to chronic infection and persistent inflammation. 
 Current Treatment Landscape for CF 
 Until the development of CFTR modulators, approved therapies to treat patients with CF only treated the symptoms of CF, by preventing and controlling infections that occur in the lungs. Accordingly, antibiotics are frequently used in conjunction with mucus-thinning drugs. A significant portion of patients with CF are prescribed bronchodilators, although no bronchodilator is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with CF. 
 For patients with certain genetic mutations, three medications have been shown to have direct effects on CFTR. The first is ivacaftor, or Kalydeco, a small molecule marketed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Vertex, which stimulates the activity of certain types of defective CFTR and is known as a CFTR potentiator. Another CFTR-specific drug, lumacaftor, helps stabilize defective and misfolded CFTR molecules, allowing increased trafficking of CFTR to the cell membrane rather than to protein degradation pathways. Orkambi, a small molecule also marketed by Vertex, combines ivacaftor and lumacaftor. Orkambi was approved by the FDA in 2015 based on its ability to improve lung function in subsets of patients with CF with certain genetic mutations. A third drug marketed by Vertex, tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor, or Symdeko, was approved in February 2018 by the FDA for the treatment of patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or have at least one mutation in their CFTR gene that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Vertex reported aggregate product revenues of $3.04 billion from sales of Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symdeko in 2018 and $2.17 billion from sales of Kalydeco and Orkambi in 2017. While these therapies improve lung function, they are limited to patients with certain genetic mutations, and although Kalydeco is considered the best available treatment for providing clinical benefit in pulmonary function in CF, patients treated with Kalydeco still experience pulmonary exacerbations, which are typically caused by bacterial infections in the lungs. None of Kalydeco, Orkambi or Symdeko is able to halt the progressive decline in pulmonary function, which represents a significant unmet medical need. 
 An mRNA therapy that results in the expression of the functional CFTR protein has the potential to significantly reduce the number of pulmonary exacerbations, halt the progressive decline in pulmonary function and provide significant improvements in lung function. We believe there is a significant unmet need and market opportunity for an mRNA therapy that can restore fully functional CFTR protein across all patients with CF regardless of the underlying genetic mutation. 
 Our Solution: MRT5005 
 We are developing MRT5005 to treat all patients with CF, regardless of the underlying mutation in CFTR, including those with limited or no CFTR protein. We designed MRT5005 to be inhaled via a handheld nebulizer. Once the inhaled MRT5005 has entered the epithelial cells lining the patient’s lungs, our therapeutic mRNA uses the cells’ own machinery for translation and expression of fully functional CFTR protein, thereby restoring this essential ion channel, which we believe will address the pathology of CF directly. Our CFTR mRNA encodes the protein that forms a functional ion channel that is defective or absent in patients with CF, and we have observed functionally active ion channels in preclinical studies. In our preclinical studies we have observed dose-dependent increases in CFTR being restored to cell membranes. The inhaled formulation of MRT5005 resulted in broad CFTR expression in lung tissue. We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MRT5005 in patients with CF. 
 Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial.    In our double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 clinical trial of MRT5005, we plan to enroll at least 32 adult patients with CF across multiple sites in the United States. In Part A of the clinical trial, three groups of four subjects each will receive a single dose of placebo or 8 mg, 16 mg or 24 mg of MRT5005, respectively. In Part B of the trial, different subjects will receive five weekly doses of placebo or 8 mg, 16 mg or 24 mg of MRT5005. In Part C of the trial, the final part, two groups of four subjects each will also receive five weekly doses of placebo or one of the two highest tolerated doses, and will also undergo bronchoscopies prior to the first dose and after the last dose. The primary endpoint of this trial will be the safety and tolerability of MRT5005. Secondary endpoints will include quantitative measures of the ability to deliver CFTR mRNA and show expression of CFTR protein in bronchial cells retrieved from patients’ airways and to assess changes in CFTR ion channel activity in the airways. 
 In this Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we will also perform measurements of forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1, which is a well-defined and accepted endpoint measuring lung function based on completed clinical trials for currently marketed therapies. FEV1 represents the amount of air that can be exhaled from the lungs in one second. The rate of decline in FEV1 in patients with CF has been demonstrated to correlate with life expectancy and to be a strong clinical predictor of mortality. In patients with CF, lung function is typically reported as a fraction of their FEV1 compared to that of a healthy individual of the same height, sex and race. We expect to design future clinical trials in which improvements in FEV1 or the reduction of pulmonary exacerbations will be the primary efficacy endpoint. 
 14

We anticipate reporting interim data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the second half of 2019.
 Preclinical Validation of Our Approach.    Human CFTR protein is a large, transmembrane protein that undergoes critical folding and extensive glycosylation prior to being trafficked to incorporate into the membrane of the cell within the lungs. By delivering mRNA encoding the CFTR protein to cells, we rely on the endogenous ribosomes to not only translate the proper CFTR protein, but also to accurately fold, glycosylate and traffic the protein to its natural state and location within the cell. 
 Our preclinical program included in vitro studies as well as in vivo studies in multiple species to establish the ability of our MRT platform for the treatment of CF. We conducted in vitro studies in which we observed that our CFTR mRNA drug substance successfully resulted in the production of human CFTR protein and we observed ion channel activity of the measured CFTR protein. We obtained substantial data through in vivo studies conducted in mice, rats and non-human primates, or NHPs. In these studies, we observed successful mRNA delivery and subsequent human CFTR protein production within the lungs of all species tested. In addition, we generated ion channel activity, biodistribution, pharmacokinetic and safety data through in vivo evaluation of single- and multiple-dose regimens. 
 In Vitro Validation of MRT5005.    We performed an in vitro study to evaluate the ability of our CFTR mRNA drug substance to produce human CFTR protein. In this study, we introduced the mRNA into cells and, after a given period of time, we analyzed the cells for human CFTR protein using standard laboratory methods. We observed a dose-dependent correlation with respect to both the amount of CFTR mRNA introduced into cells and the amount of full length human CFTR protein produced. 
 Once we established that our mRNA drug substance could produce the desired human CFTR protein, we used an in vitro Ussing Chamber assay to evaluate whether the mRNA-derived CFTR protein was active. An Ussing Chamber assay is commonly used to determine the function of CFTR protein by measuring ion transport across a cell membrane through CFTR. In this in vitro study, we evaluated the activity of the CFTR protein that was produced from three separate manufacturing lots of our CFTR mRNA drug substance. We evaluated each lot of our CFTR mRNA in polarized epithelial cells and conducted electrophysiological assays to measure ion flow across the cell membrane through our CFTR mRNA. 
 As depicted below, three independent parameters confirmed that this ion flow was due to increased CFTR activity. First, the activity was stimulated by forskolin, a known activator of CFTR. The activity was further stimulated by ivacaftor, an FDA-approved potentiator of CFTR function, and it was selectively inhibited by a human-specific CFTR inhibitor. Based on these findings, we believe that the human CFTR protein produced from our mRNA drug substance was active and produced normal ion channel activity. 
 15



Additionally, in other in vitro studies, MRT5005 demonstrated active CFTR ion channel in human bronchial epithelial cells that were derived from human lung tissue. 
 In Vivo Validation of MRT5005.    We conducted in vivo studies to further evaluate whether the application of MRT5005 produced fully functional CFTR protein activity. In order for the mRNA drug substance to enter the epithelial cells, MRT5005 must cross the mucus layer of the diseased lung. We tested MRT5005 in a rat CFTR knockout model developed at the University of Alabama. The rats in this model had increased mucus occlusions within the lung layer and nasal epithelial cells, which resemble conditions comparable to those of humans with CF. We evaluated the ability of MRT5005 to cross the mucus layer of diseased cells and produce functional CFTR protein in the underlying epithelial cells by measuring forskolin-induced electrochemical changes in respiratory epithelial cells of anesthetized rats. In this study, the lack of functional CFTR ion channel activity resulted in a potential difference change of approximately five millivolts. These data support the ability of MRT5005 to cross the mucus layer of diseased cells and deliver our CFTR mRNA to the underlying cells thereby resulting in the production of functional CFTR proteins in the cells. The figure below depicts the potential difference in the forskolin-induced electrochemical changes in rat respiratory nasal cells with and without CFTR-dependent chloride transport in the rat CF model after treatment with MRT5005. 
 16



We also investigated the ability of a single dose of MRT5005 to deliver CFTR mRNA to lungs in rats and NHPs. We observed CFTR mRNA levels of up to 1,500-fold higher than normal in NHPs 24 hours after a single exposure to MRT5005. We also observed high levels of human CFTR mRNA deposition after a single administration in rats. While these levels in the rats decreased over time, CFTR mRNA deposition was still detectable at higher than normal levels 28 days after administration at the highest doses. Biodistribution analysis of multiple respiratory tract organs demonstrated that the large majority of our drug product deposited in the lungs of rats and NHPs. We believe that these results provide preclinical validation of the ability of MRT5005 to reach the lungs while protecting the delivered mRNA from rapid degradation by nuclease activity. 
 The figure below presents the fold increase in levels of human CFTR mRNA in the lungs of rats after a single aerosolized administration of MRT5005 when compared to normal rat CFTR mRNA levels. 
 

17

We evaluated CFTR protein expression in normal NHPs and rats and observed a dose-dependent staining intensity that generally reflected the mRNA levels that were measured. Importantly, after a single dose, we observed significant staining in the NHPs at one week post-administration. We observed remaining CFTR expression at 28 days post-administration at the high dose levels in the rats. We observed that CFTR protein expression was widespread throughout the upper and lower airways in both NHPs and rats. 
 In this study, and as shown in the figure that follows, we observed that cells throughout the bronchial and alveolar epithelium demonstrated dose-dependent CFTR protein expression. 
 

The figure below shows widespread distribution of human CFTR protein in lung tissue with successful human CFTR protein production in both bronchial epithelial cells as well as alveolar regions in NHPs. We have also observed membrane localization of human CFTR protein within the lung epithelial cells of treated NHPs. 
 

18

We have conducted multiple-dose inhalation in vivo studies in both rats and NHPs. We administered five weekly treatments with a 28-day recovery period in each species. We monitored safety as well as pharmacodynamic parameters. We observed robust delivery of human CFTR mRNA upon treatment with MRT5005, resulting in higher than normal levels of CFTR mRNA, similar to what we observed in the single dose administration studies. We observed widespread distribution of the resulting human CFTR protein, with intense staining in both the bronchial epithelial cells as well as lower airway and alveolar regions. Upon multiple exposures, we observed the presence of human CFTR protein 28 days after the final treatment in rats and NHPs. More specifically, after five weekly doses of MRT5005, we observed a dose-dependent increase in human CFTR protein production. Data from the multiple-dose study in NHPs is depicted below, representing robust protein production of the high dose at week 5 as well as the presence of human CFTR protein at 28 days post-treatment. 
 

MRT5005 was well-tolerated in all of our preclinical studies at all doses. We have not observed adverse effects or physiological changes throughout the preclinical toxicology studies in rats and NHPs. Histopathological analysis of the lungs and respiratory tract tissues after multiple-dose regimens demonstrated normal histology and normal morphology with no signs of inflammation. Based on these results, we believe that MRT5005 has the potential to safely and efficiently deliver mRNA to the lungs and successfully result in CFTR protein production within the epithelial cells of the lung. 
 Lead Program for the Liver: MRT5201 
 Our lead MRT product candidate for the liver, MRT5201, is designed to address the underlying cause of OTC deficiency by delivering mRNA encoding fully functional OTC enzyme to hepatocytes through intravenous administration. There is a large unmet medical need for patients with OTC deficiency as these patients may experience high blood ammonia levels and liver failure and have early mortality. In our preclinical studies, we observed successful delivery of MRT5201 to the liver and the resulting production of fully functional OTC enzyme. 
 We believe MRT5201 will be the first clinical-stage mRNA product candidate designed to deliver mRNA encoding fully functional OTC enzyme to hepatocytes. Our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial for MRT5201 in patients with OTC deficiency is not yet active and has not recruited any patients. In December 2018, we submitted an IND to the FDA supporting the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for MRT5201 in patients with OTC deficiency. Subsequently, the FDA notified us that our IND for MRT5201 was placed on clinical hold. Prior to initiation of our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial, the FDA is requiring additional preclinical toxicology data to assess the potential for adverse effects related to the clearance time of MRT5201. We have identified the additional preclinical studies required, and plan to complete these studies and submit a response to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 OTC Deficiency 
 OTC deficiency is a metabolic liver enzyme disorder that results from a mutation in the OTC gene. OTC deficiency is the most common urea cycle disorder. The OTC enzyme is necessary for preventing the accumulation of ammonia, a normal byproduct of protein breakdown. When the enzyme is defective or absent, high levels of ammonia accumulate in the blood, which can cause serious and irreversible neurological damage. 
 OTC deficiency can manifest in a neonatal onset form and a later onset form. In the neonatal form, infants with a urea cycle disorder may have symptoms such as lethargy, poor feeding, seizures and breathing difficulties. Unless treatment is promptly initiated, the high ammonia levels, or hyperammonemia, may lead to coma and/or permanent neurocognitive damage. In the later onset form, symptoms may manifest for the first time anytime from childhood to adulthood. These symptoms can include vomiting, developmental delays and seizures. Hyperammonemic crises are often triggered by infections or catabolic-stress. 
 19

Based on published research, the incidence of OTC deficiency is estimated to be 1 in 56,500 live births in the United States. OTC deficiency is an X-chromosome-linked disease, and females are typically less severely affected than males. 
 Current Treatment Landscape for OTC Deficiency 
 The standard treatment for patients with OTC deficiency consists of severe dietary protein restriction with essential amino acid supplements, along with treatment with ammonia scavengers that drive the incorporation of ammonia into metabolites that are readily excreted. Patients routinely receive carbohydrate- and lipid-rich nutrition, including overnight feeding through a nasogastric tube. During acute hyperammonemic crises, patients with OTC deficiency may require dialysis or hemofiltration to control ammonia levels. 
 A liver transplant can be a curative solution to OTC deficiency. Liver transplant is limited by donor availability and patient eligibility and has significant risks associated with the surgery. Liver transplantation is especially complicated in neonatal patients and young children, which leads to delaying transplants until these patients are older. Unfortunately, some patients die while awaiting transplants. In addition to these risks associated with surgery itself, transplant patients also frequently suffer long-term complications related to the immunosuppression medications required to prevent organ rejection, which have side effects that include increased rates of infections, malignancy, and kidney toxicity. 
 Our Solution: MRT5201 
 We are developing MRT5201 to treat patients with OTC deficiency. We have developed MRT5201 for intravenous administration and delivery of mRNA encoding fully functional OTC enzyme to the liver to enable the hepatocytes to produce the normal OTC enzyme. We expect that sufficient expression of the natural OTC enzyme in hepatocytes would reduce or eliminate the need for current treatments such as strict low-protein diets or ammonia scavengers. Given the high unmet need and limited therapeutic options available, we believe that regulatory approval can be obtained based on clinical trials with relatively small patient populations. In December 2018, we submitted an IND to the FDA supporting the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for MRT5201 in patients with OTC deficiency. Subsequently, the FDA notified us that our IND for MRT5201 was placed on clinical hold. Prior to initiation of our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial, the FDA is requiring additional preclinical toxicology data to assess the potential for adverse effects related to the clearance time of MRT5201. We have identified the additional preclinical studies required, and plan to complete these studies and submit a response to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 Preclinical Studies of Our Approach.    We have established the ability of our MRT platform to treat OTC deficiency using in vitro studies as well as in vivo studies in multiple species. We conducted in vitro studies demonstrating that our mRNA successfully resulted in the production of human OTC enzyme, as well as subsequent activity of the measured OTC enzyme. We obtained substantial data through in vivo studies conducted in mice and NHPs. In these studies, we observed successful mRNA delivery and subsequent human OTC enzyme production within the livers of all species tested. In addition, we evaluated OTC enzyme activity and the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of single- and multiple-dose regimens. 
 In Vivo Validation of MRT5201.    In in vivo studies using a mouse model where the gene for OTC has been rendered dysfunctional, we observed delivery of MRT5201 and the resulting expression of functionally active human OTC enzyme. This mouse model was designed to replicate certain clinical features of OTC deficiency, such as elevated urinary orotic acid and the inability to metabolize high levels of ammonia in the blood. As depicted in the figure below, a single treatment with MRT5201 resulted in normalization of urinary orotic acid levels in this mouse model. 
 20



We deliberately challenged OTC-deficient mice with exogenous ammonia to mimic a hyperammonemic episode. Untreated OTC-deficient mice challenged with exongenous ammonia are unable to reduce their ammonia levels and suffer severe morbidity. We observed that after treatment with MRT5201 these OTC-deficient mice were able to reduce their ammonia levels to levels that are normal for wild-type mice, as shown in the figure below. We observed that this protective effect against hyperammonemia persisted in these mice for up to four weeks after a single dose. 
 

We also conducted multiple-dose studies of MRT5201 in OTC-deficient mice. We observed successful OTC enzyme production in the livers of these mice over the course of eight weekly intravenous administrations of MRT5201. We observed robust activity each week resulting in ornithine metabolism levels well above the minimum therapeutic level necessary, which suggested that the OTC enzyme was fully functioning. 
 21



An mRNA therapeutic for OTC deficiency must be delivered to a broad population of the liver cells in order to be effective. We conducted in vivo studies to evaluate the delivery and distribution of MRT5201 in NHPs. As shown in the figure below, we have observed successful delivery of MRT5201 to the liver, and more specifically to the hepatocytes, of NHPs after intravenous administration. As shown on the left, intracellular mRNA localization after a single dose of MRT5201 in NHPs resulted in the detection of high levels of OTC mRNA throughout the liver, indicating high and widespread distribution. Moreover, as shown on the right, we observed corresponding human OTC enzyme production within the liver cells after treatment with MRT5201. 
 

We have also performed multiple-dose in vivo studies of MRT5201 in both mice and NHPs. Based on the studies discussed above, we have established satisfactory therapeutic index levels of MRT5201 in both species, which has enabled us to submit an IND to the FDA to support the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for MRT5201 in patients with OTC deficiency. Our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial for MRT5201 in patients with OTC deficiency is not yet active and has not recruited any patients. In response to the FDA’s clinical hold on our IND for MRT5201, we have identified the preclinical studies required and plan to complete these studies and submit a response to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 Other Indications and Target Tissues 
 We believe that our MRT platform may be applied across a broad array of diseases and target tissues via multiple routes of administration, including for the treatment of a wide range of rare and non-rare diseases, including CNS disorders and ocular diseases. We believe our platform may also be applied to produce therapeutic antibodies and vaccines in such areas as infectious disease and oncology. 
 We have several discovery-stage programs to identify additional potential mRNA therapeutic candidates. Specifically, we are exploring potential MRT product candidates for diseases of the CNS. With regard to MRT product candidates designed to engage the lymphatic system, we are exploring multiple routes of administration, along with conducting research to identify product candidates 
 22

for infectious disease and cancer vaccines. Our research for targeted tissues such as the eye, CNS and lymphatic system builds on the preliminary formulations we have identified as well as developing new delivery systems specifically designed for each formulation. We are working to develop new product candidates using our current delivery vehicles to treat additional rare diseases of the lung, including primary ciliary dyskinesia, and the liver. All of these programs are in the discovery stage. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe we have significant competitive advantages with our industry-leading expertise in mRNA technology, rare disease clinical development expertise and advanced intellectual property position, we currently face and will continue to face competition for our development programs from companies that use mRNA, gene editing or gene therapy development platforms and from companies focused on more traditional therapeutic modalities, such as small molecules. 
 The competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including larger pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academia. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. For any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, we will have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Our competitors also include companies that are or will be developing other mRNA technology methods as well as small molecules, biologics and nucleic acid-based therapies for the same indications that we are targeting with our mRNA-based therapeutics. Some of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. These same competitors may invent technology that competes with our product candidates. 
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even greater concentration of resources among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and registering subjects for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, health-economic benefit, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic or biosimilar competition and the availability of adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products faster or earlier than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our products, if approved, will be priced at a premium over competitive generic products, and our ability to compete may be affected by insurers or other third-party payors encouraging the use of generic products.

 Asset Purchase Agreement with Shire 
 On December 22, 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Shire, which, as amended on June 7, 2018, we refer to as the Shire Agreement, pursuant to which Shire assigned to us all of its rights to certain patent rights, permits, real property leases, contracts, regulatory documentation, books and records, and materials related to Shire’s mRNA therapy platform, or the MRT Program, including its CFTR and OTC deficiency mRNA therapy programs. The scientific founders of the MRT platform who were responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and delivery know-how and intellectual property supporting this platform joined our company as part of the acquisition. We paid Shire an aggregate purchase price of $112.2 million, consisting of 5,815,560 shares of common stock with an aggregate fair value of $41.1 million on the acquisition date and contingent consideration with an aggregate fair value of $71.1 million on the acquisition date. As further described below, the contingent consideration includes the obligation to issue additional shares of common stock to Shire in connection with the closing of subsequent equity financings required under the terms of the Shire Agreement, as well as the obligation to make future milestone and earnout payments upon the occurrence of specified commercial milestones. We and Shire entered into an amendment to the asset purchase agreement on June 7, 2018 to align certain terms of the asset purchase agreement with the collaboration and license agreement that we entered into with Sanofi on June 8, 2018. 
 Under the Shire Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek and obtain regulatory approval for products that include or are composed of MRT compounds covered by or derived from patent rights or know-how acquired from Shire, or MRT Products, and to achieve specific developmental milestones. Pursuant to the amendment entered into on June 7, 2018, an mRNA vaccine that is developed pursuant to our collaboration with Sanofi will be considered an MRT Product if it includes an MRT compound having an mRNA sequence that encodes a protein that is from, or that binds to, an infectious disease pathogen in a field that has been licensed by us to Sanofi. During the earnout period described below, with respect to any MRT Product in any country, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to market and sell such MRT Product in such country. 
 24

We are obligated to make milestone payments to Shire of up to $60.0 million in the aggregate upon the occurrence of specified commercial milestones, including upon the first commercial sale of an MRT Product for the treatment of CF and upon the achievement of a specified level of annual net sales with respect to an MRT Product. We are also obligated to make additional milestone payments of $10.0 million for each non-CF MRT Product upon the first commercial sale of a non-CF MRT Product; provided that such milestone payments will only be due once for any two non-CF MRT Products that contain the same MRT compounds or once per non-CF MRT Product that is a vaccine developed under our collaboration with Sanofi. 
 Under the Shire Agreement we are also obligated to pay a quarterly earnout payment of a mid-single-digit percentage of net sales of each MRT Product. The earnout period, which is determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, will begin on the date of the first commercial sale of such MRT Product in such country and will end on the later of (i) 10 years after such first commercial sale and (ii) the expiration of the last valid claim of the patent rights acquired from Shire or derived from patent rights or know-how acquired from Shire covering such MRT Product in such country. 
 Prior to first dosing of the first patient with a CFTR MRT Product in a Phase 3 clinical trial, we are obligated to notify Shire if we receive a written notice from a third party seeking to (i) acquire, license or obtain rights to develop or sell a CFTR MRT Product or (ii) other than a transaction resulting in a change of control of our company, acquire all or a substantial portion of the assets we acquired from Shire or our other assets that are necessary for or related to the development and commercialization of CFTR MRT Products. Before we may enter into negotiations with any third party, Shire has 30 days to notify us of its interest in negotiating an agreement with respect to the rights or assets proposed to be acquired by the third party. If Shire provides such notice, we must negotiate exclusively with Shire for up to 90 days. If Shire does not notify us of its interest in such opportunity within such 30-day period, or if we and Shire do not enter into an agreement with respect to such opportunity within such 90-day period, then, for a period of 12 months, we may grant the rights or sell the assets to a third party on such terms as we may determine in our sole discretion without any further obligation to Shire with respect to the rights or assets subject to the proposal, but we may not enter into exclusive negotiations with any third party for a period longer than 90 days. 
 
Under the Shire Agreement, we were obligated to consummate an equity financing at or prior to the closing of the Shire transaction with gross proceeds of at least $50.0 million, and, because the gross proceeds for our first tranche of such equity financing were less than $100.0 million, we were obligated to use the first $50.0 million of net proceeds solely for activities and expenses associated with the MRT platform and/or specified transferred assets and to satisfy our obligations under the Shire Agreement and related documents until the earlier of (i) the consummation of another tranche or tranches of equity financing with aggregate gross proceeds equal to at least (A) $100.0 million minus (B) the gross proceeds from the first tranche and (ii) full utilization of the proceeds. In addition, we were required to use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate subsequent tranches until aggregate proceeds from the first tranche and all subsequent tranches were at least $100.0 million and, until we completed such equity financings, to issue additional shares of our common stock to Shire in satisfaction of anti-dilution obligations. Our obligation to issue additional shares of our common stock to Shire was satisfied upon the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO. 
 Pursuant to the Shire Agreement, we may not take any action that would result in Shire and its affiliates beneficially owning more than 19.9% of the voting power of all of our outstanding common stock, excluding from the denominator shares of unvested restricted stock.  If Shire and its affiliates beneficially own more than 19.9% of our outstanding common stock, we are obligated to redeem the shares of common stock in excess of such threshold at Shire’s election at the then fair market value of the common stock.  We are not obligated to redeem such excess shares to the extent that Shire may sell such excess shares of common stock without limitation pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. 
 Sanofi Collaboration and License Agreement
 On June 8, 2018, our wholly owned subsidiary Translate Bio MA, Inc. entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi, which we refer to as the Sanofi Agreement, to develop mRNA vaccines for up to five infectious disease pathogens. The Sanofi Agreement became effective on July 9, 2018.
 Under the Sanofi Agreement, we and Sanofi have agreed to collaborate to perform certain research and development activities to advance mRNA vaccines and mRNA vaccine platform development during a three-year research term, which may be extended by mutual agreement. The collaboration activities will be subject to a collaboration plan to be updated annually. The Sanofi Agreement provides for Sanofi to make an upfront payment to us of $45.0 million, which we received in July 2018, as well as certain potential milestone payments and option payments, each as further described below. In addition, we are eligible to receive from Sanofi tiered royalty payments on worldwide net sales of mRNA vaccines. 
 Under the Sanofi Agreement, we and Sanofi have created a governance structure, including committees and working groups, to manage the activities under the collaboration. If we and Sanofi do not mutually agree on certain decisions, Sanofi would be able to

break a deadlock without our consent. The collaboration plan includes an estimated budget. Sanofi is responsible for paying our employee costs, out-of-pocket costs paid to third parties and manufacturing costs, up to a specified amount. 
 Under the terms of the Sanofi Agreement, we have granted to Sanofi exclusive, worldwide licenses under applicable patents, patent applications, know-how and materials, including those arising under the collaboration, to develop, commercialize and manufacture mRNA vaccines to prevent, treat or cure diseases, disorders or conditions in humans caused by any of three infectious disease pathogens, which we call the Licensed Fields. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Sanofi Agreement and subject to certain limitations, Sanofi has options to add up to two additional infectious disease pathogens within the granted licenses to the Licensed Fields by exercising either option or both options during a specified option term and paying us a $5.0 million fee per added pathogen. If, prior to the exercise of the options by Sanofi, we receive a bona fide third-party offer to acquire rights to the field to which an option relates, we must notify Sanofi of such offer, and if Sanofi does not exercise its option as to the applicable field, such field will no longer be subject to the option. 
 We and Sanofi retain the rights to perform our respective obligations and exercise our respective rights under the Sanofi Agreement, and Sanofi may grant sublicenses to affiliates or third parties. Sanofi has also granted us non-exclusive, sublicenseable licenses under patent rights claiming certain improvements that Sanofi may make to the technology we have licensed to it or claiming certain technology arising from the collaboration and owned by Sanofi. We may exercise such licenses to develop, manufacture and commercialize products, other than products that use a vaccine to prevent, treat or cure a disease, disorder or condition in humans caused by an infectious disease pathogen. If we commercialize any product covered by such a Sanofi patent right, we would pay Sanofi a royalty of a low single-digit percentage. Sanofi may terminate these licenses to us if we materially breach the terms of the license and the breach remains uncured for a specified period, which may be extended in certain circumstances. 
 Sanofi has sole responsibility for all commercialization activities for mRNA vaccines in the Licensed Fields and is obligated to bear all costs in connection with any such commercialization. We and Sanofi intend to enter into a supply agreement pursuant to which we would be responsible for manufacturing certain non-clinical and clinical mRNA vaccines and materials containing mRNA until we transfer such manufacturing capabilities to Sanofi. We would be entitled to receive payments for manufacturing mRNA vaccines under the supply agreement. 
 The Sanofi Agreement provides that we are eligible to receive aggregate potential payments of up to $805.0 million from Sanofi, which includes an upfront payment, potential milestone payments and potential option exercise payments. In July 2018, Sanofi paid us a $45.0 million upfront payment in respect of the licenses and options granted to Sanofi. Sanofi will also pay us $5.0 million with respect to each additional Licensed Field for which it exercises an option. Sanofi has also agreed to pay us milestone payments upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercialization milestones. In particular, we are entitled to receive development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $63.0 million per Licensed Field and sales milestone payments of up to $85.0 million per Licensed Field. In addition, we are entitled to receive a $10.0 million milestone payment from Sanofi following completion of the technology and process transfer. 
 Sanofi has agreed to pay us a tiered royalty on worldwide net sales of all mRNA vaccines within each Licensed Field ranging from a high single-digit percentage to a low teens percentage, depending on quarterly net sales by Sanofi, its affiliates and its sublicensees. The royalty paid to us can be reduced with respect to a product once the relevant licensed patent rights expire or if additional licensed technology is required, but the royalty payments generally may not fall below our royalty obligations to third parties plus a royalty of a low single-digit percentage. Royalty payments under the Sanofi Agreement are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis beginning on the launch of the product in the country until the later of the expiration of the last valid claim covering such product or 10 years after the launch of such product in such country. 
 The Sanofi Agreement provides that it will remain in effect until terminated in accordance with its terms. Either we or Sanofi may terminate the Sanofi Agreement in its entirety if the other party is subject to certain insolvency proceedings. Either party may terminate the Sanofi Agreement in its entirety or with respect to a particular Licensed Field, country or product if the other party materially breaches the Sanofi Agreement and the breach remains uncured for a specified period, which may be extended in certain circumstances. Sanofi may also terminate the Sanofi agreement in its entirety or with respect to a particular Licensed Field, country or product for safety reasons or for convenience, in each case after a specified notice period. After termination of the Sanofi Agreement, Sanofi may continue to manufacture and commercialize the terminated products for a specified period of time, subject to Sanofi’s payment obligations. 
 License Agreements 
 Exclusive Patent License Agreement with MIT 
 In November 2013, Shire AG entered into an agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, for a worldwide license, under specified patent rights owned by MIT, and Shire made a one-time, upfront payment of $75,000, plus 
 26

reimbursed certain patent expenses of MIT. In July 2015, Shire AG’s successor Shire International GmbH and MIT amended the license agreement to include certain additional patent rights owned jointly by MIT and Shire related to inventions developed pursuant to a research agreement between MIT and Shire, and Shire made a one-time, upfront payment of $15,000. We acquired the license in December 2016 as part of our acquisition of the MRT Program from Shire. We and MIT amended the agreement on April 11, 2017 to modify the development milestone timetable discussed below. 
 The agreement grants us an exclusive license under the licensed patent rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize any product containing both (i) any RNA sequences, including mRNA, that encode a protein or peptide suitable for human therapeutic use, which may include operably linked non-coding sequences that facilitate translation of the coding portion of such RNA sequence, but such non-coding sequences do not include nucleic acids that function through an RNA interface mechanism or transcriptional activation mechanism, which RNA sequences we call the coding RNA component, and (ii) products covered by the licensed patent rights, which we call the lipid products. We call a product containing both a coding RNA component and a lipid product a licensed product. Under the licensed patent rights, we are permitted to develop, manufacture and commercialize the licensed products for the delivery of coding RNA components to treat disease in humans. The license is subject to certain rights retained by MIT and other non-profit research institutions for research, teaching and educational purposes, rights retained under law by the federal government due to its funding the creation of the invention and rights granted to the sponsor of the research resulting in the inventions permitting internal research by the sponsor and its research collaborators. 
 We have the right to grant sublicenses under this license. The patent rights licensed to us by MIT include claims that cover our customized LNPs used for delivery of coding RNA components in our MRT platform, including MRT5201 and products that may be developed under our collaboration with Sanofi. 
 Under the license agreement, we are obligated to make an annual license maintenance fee payment to MIT, payable on January 1 of each calendar year, of up to $0.2 million, which may be credited against royalties subsequently due on net sales of licensed products earned in the same calendar year. For each of the calendar years 2017 and 2018, we made annual license maintenance fee payments of $0.1 million to MIT. 
 We are also obligated to make milestone payments to MIT aggregating up to $1.375 million upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones with respect to each licensed product and $1.250 million upon our first commercial sale of each licensed product, and to pay royalties of a low single-digit percentage to MIT based on our, and any of our affiliates’ and sublicensees’, net sales of licensed products. The royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, and may be reduced in specified circumstances. Our obligation to make royalty payments extends with respect to a licensed product in a country until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent or patent application licensed from MIT covering the licensed product in the country. In addition, we are obligated to pay MIT a low double-digit percentage of the portion of income from sublicensees that we ascribe to the MIT-licensed patents, excluding royalties on net sales and research support payments. In 2019, pursuant to such provision, we have agreed to pay $0.7 million to MIT as their share of sublicense income with respect to the upfront payment received under the Sanofi Agreement as well as future option and milestone payments that we may receive pursuant to the Sanofi Agreement. The amounts that we may owe to MIT will depend upon the relative value of the patents we licensed from MIT and sublicensed to Sanofi as compared to the other rights that we licensed to Sanofi. The determination of the relative value of such rights is subject to a process described in our license agreement with MIT.
 The agreement obligates us to use commercially reasonable efforts and expend a minimum amount of resources each year to develop licensed products in accordance with a development plan and a development milestone timetable specified in the agreement, to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize licensed products and, upon commercialization, to make the licensed products reasonably available to the public. 
 MIT has the right to terminate the agreement if we fail to pay amounts when due or otherwise materially breach the agreement and fail to cure such nonpayment or breach within specified cure periods or in the event we cease to carry on our business related to the agreement. In the event of a termination due to our breach caused by a due diligence failure of a licensed product, but where we have fulfilled our obligations with respect to a different licensed product, MIT may not terminate the agreement with respect to the different licensed product. MIT may immediately terminate the agreement if we or any of our affiliates bring specified patent challenges against MIT or assist others in bringing a patent challenge against MIT. We have the right to terminate the agreement for our convenience at any time on three months’ prior written notice to MIT and payment of all amounts due to MIT through the date of termination. 
 Our patent rights, and the rights of our affiliates and sublicensees, in specified licensed products may also terminate, if, after November 1, 2018, we, our affiliates or MIT receive a request from a third party to develop such licensed product for which we are unable to, within nine months of receiving notice of any such request, either demonstrate that we have initiated a fully funded project for the commercial development of such licensed product and provide a business plan with acceptable milestones; demonstrate that the 
 27

licensed product proposed by such third party would be competitive with a licensed product for which we have initiated a fully funded project; or enter into a sublicense agreement with such third party on commercially reasonable terms, and, in each case, MIT, in its sole discretion, grants a license to such third party for the specified patent rights. As of March 14, 2019, we have not received any such request. 
 Agreement with Ethris GMBH 
 In December 2012, Shire AG entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Ethris GMBH, or Ethris. While the research collaboration and license agreement has ended, certain rights survive its termination. With respect to patents and patent applications arising out of the agreement that pertain to the MRT5005 product that are jointly owned by Ethris and us, we and Ethris each have the right to practice and to exploit the jointly owned intellectual property without the approval of the other party. These rights include the right to license or assign the technology of the jointly owned intellectual property to a third party without the approval of the other party. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce our proprietary and intellectual property rights relating to our programs and our core technologies for messenger RNA therapeutics, including discoveries, developments in improvements of mRNA compositions, manufacturing techniques and analytics, as well as lipid nanoparticle and other delivery vehicle compositions, manufacturing techniques and analytics. Our success also depends in part on our ability to develop and commercialize therapeutic products without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property positions by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications relating to technology important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing innovation to develop, maintain and expand our proprietary and intellectual property positions. 
 We file patent applications directed to our key programs, including MRT5005 and MRT5201, in an effort to establish broad and dominant intellectual property positions regarding new compositions relating to these programs as well as uses of these and similar compositions in the treatment of relevant diseases. We also seek patent protection with respect to methods of making these compositions and to therapeutic biomarkers that may be useful in establishing or monitoring the efficacy of these compositions in patients. As of December 31, 2018, we owned or licensed 38 issued or allowed U.S. patents, 51 U.S. pending non-provisional patent applications, 60 issued or allowed foreign patents, 175 foreign pending patent applications, and 41 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, or provisional patent applications relating to mRNA therapeutics. The foreign issued patent and patent applications are in a number of jurisdictions, including Europe, including Eastern Europe, North America including Canada and Mexico, Australia, Asia, India and South America. 
 The intellectual property portfolios for our most advanced programs as of December 31, 2018, are summarized below. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO can be significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. We expect this could be the case with respect to some of our pending patent applications referred to below. 
 MRT5005 
 The intellectual property portfolio for our MRT5005 program includes patents and applications directed to compositions for the mRNA component of MRT5005 as well as analogs thereof, to compositions for the delivery vehicle component of MRT5005 as well as analogs thereof, to compositions for the combination of the mRNA delivery vehicle components of MRT5005, as well as to methods for using and making these novel compositions. As of December 31, 2018, we owned or licensed nine issued or allowed U.S. patents, six issued or allowed European patents, 13 pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications, seven pending European patent applications, at least 46 other foreign patents and patent applications in a number of jurisdictions, and six pending PCT or provisional patent applications relating to our MRT5005 program. The U.S. or ex-U.S. issued patents or patents issuing from these pending applications for our MRT5005 program will have a statutory expiration date from 2030 to 2039. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates. 
 MRT5201 
 The intellectual property portfolio for our MRT5201 program includes patents and patent applications directed to compositions for the mRNA component of MRT5201 as well as analogs thereof, to compositions for the delivery vehicle component of MRT5201 as well as analogs thereof, to compositions for the combination of the mRNA and delivery vehicle components of MRT5201, as well as to methods for using and making these novel compositions. As of December 31, 2018, we owned or licensed 12 issued or allowed 
 28

U.S. patents, four issued or allowed European patents, 13 pending U.S. patent applications, nine pending European patent applications, at least 67 other foreign patents and patent applications in a number of jurisdictions, and five pending PCT or provisional patent applications relating to our MRT5201 program. The U.S. or ex-U.S. issued patents or patents issuing from the pending applications covering our MRT5201 program will have a statutory expiration date from 2030 to 2038. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each medicine and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. 
 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property positions for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, it may happen that certain patent applications that we have filed or may file, or that we have licensed or may license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of corresponding patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in proceedings in the USPTO to determine invention rights, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may remain in force for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with any future collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. 
 With respect to our proprietary mRNA therapeutic technology platform, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be an important component of our intellectual property. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that with respect to this technology platform, these trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology, and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from academic to industry scientific positions. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 In light of our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We have retained worldwide commercial rights for our product candidates. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the United States and potentially in Europe with our own focused, specialty sales force. We would expect to conduct most of the buildout of this organization following approval in the United States or similar marketing authorization in Europe of any of our product candidates. We expect to explore commercialization of MRT5005 and potentially other product candidates in certain markets outside the United States, including the European Union, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties. 
 29

Manufacturing 
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for clinical trials and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our program materials to meet anticipated clinical-trial scale demands. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, third parties with whom we currently work will need to increase their scale of production or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. 
Government Regulation and Product Licensure 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, sales, reimbursements, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Licensure and Regulation of Biologics in the United States 
 In the United States, our mRNA-based therapies would be licensed by the FDA as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and applicable implementing regulations and guidance. The failure of an applicant to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including non-clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post-approval process, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, the FDA’s refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines and civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA or Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other government entities, including state agencies. 
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps before the product candidate will be licensed by the FDA: 
  
• | preclinical testing including laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations and standards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency, purity and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for a biologic product which includes not only the results of the clinical trials, but also, detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labelling for one or more proposed indication(s);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product candidate or components thereof are manufactured to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 30

 
• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA licensure of the BLA to allow marketing of the new biologic product; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS and the potential requirement to conduct any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application 
 Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 The IND and IRB Processes 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved BLA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Clinical holds are typically imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, nonclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed. 
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. 
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 31

Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Information about specified clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. Similar requirements for posting clinical trial information are present in the European Union (EudraCT) website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/ and other countries, as well.
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational products for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended) a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational products for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect.  This provision requires drug and biologic companies to make publicly available their policies for expanded access for individual patient access to products intended for serious diseases. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the investigational drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a manufacturer to make its investigational products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of a BLA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval. 
 Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. 
 32

During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the investigational biological product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. 
 Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population. 
 Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a biologic: such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.” 
 In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits a BLA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the BLA if the biologic is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary efficacy to inform pediatric labeling for the product. 
 Review and Approval of a BLA 
 In order to obtain approval to market a biological product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides sufficient data establishing the safety, purity, potency and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the biological product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
 33

The BLA is, thus, a vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new biologic product candidate must be the subject of an approved BLA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is approximately $2.6 million for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to a program fee for fiscal year 2019 of approximately $0.3 million. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. 
 Following submission of a BLA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of BLAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within 10 months from the date on which the FDA accepts the application for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of products that are not NMEs, the 10-month and 6-month review periods run from the date that the FDA receives the application. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with a BLA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. 
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the 
 34

product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from 10 months to 6 months. 
 With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. Thus, the benefit of accelerated approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with priority review. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

The FDA’s Decision on a BLA 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Post-Approval Regulation 
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements. 
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 36

 
• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. 
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must seek orphan drug designation before submitting a BLA for the candidate product. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. 
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product 
 37

for different conditions. If a biologic designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same biologic for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. That Act established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. As of January 1, 2019, the FDA has approved 17 biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars, have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidances are expected to be finalized by the FDA in the near term. 
 Under the Act, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new biologic product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
Health Care Law and Regulation 
 Health care providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of biologic products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the following: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 38

 
• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to health care items or services that are reimbursed by non-government third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 39

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 The containment of health care costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Health Care Reform 
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the health care system in the United States. In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that started in 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. 
 
Further, since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA during the next Congressional session.  Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA, during the next Congressional session.
 
The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA.  Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the Administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued such payments were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known.
 
Further, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the 
 41

relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.  For example, on May 11, 2018, the Administration issued a plan to lower drug prices.  Under this blueprint for action, the Administration indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services will: take steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies; advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition; evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers’ ads to enhance price competition; speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers; avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid; work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers; examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans, and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program; update Medicare’s drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency; prohibit Part D contracts that include “gag rules” that prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance; and require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases.
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union, or EU, generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU. We anticipate that our mRNA-based therapies designed to treat diseases caused by protein or gene dysfunction will be regulated as advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, in the EU. Additionally, there may be local legislation in various EU Member States, which may be more restrictive than the EU legislation, and we would need to comply with such legislation to the extent it applies. 
 Clinical Trial Approval 
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of ATMPs. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy and, in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide “no fault” compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial. 
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. The Regulation was published on June 16, 2014 but is not expected to apply until later in 2019. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and replacing any national legislation that was put in place to implement the Directive. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which on-going clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. 
 42

The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU Portal and Database”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the appointed reporting Member State, whose assessment report is submitted for review by the sponsor and all other competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States). Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the Concerned Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. 
 PRIME Designation in the EU 
 In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) or Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. 
 Marketing Authorization 
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Paediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across the European Economic Area (that is, the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, ATMPs and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases. We anticipate that the centralized procedure will be mandatory for the product candidates we are developing. 
 The CAT is responsible in conjunction with the CHMP for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CAT is primarily responsible for the scientific evaluation of ATMPs and prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of each ATMP for which a marketing authorization application is submitted. The CAT’s opinion is then taken into account by the CHMP when giving its final recommendation regarding the authorization of a product in view of the balance of benefits and risks identified. Although the CAT’s draft opinion is submitted to the CHMP for final approval, the CHMP may depart from the draft opinion, if it provides detailed scientific justification. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs and have published numerous guidelines, including specific guidelines on gene therapies and cell therapies. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a marketing authorization application; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs. Although these guidelines are not legally binding, we believe that it is likely that our compliance with them will be necessary to gain and maintain approval for any of our product candidates. 
 43

Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a final opinion from the CHMP, the European Commission must prepare a draft decision concerning an application for marketing authorization. This draft decision must take the opinion and any relevant provisions of EU law into account. Before arriving at a final decision on an application for centralized authorization of a medicinal product the European Commission must consult the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use. The Standing Committee is composed of representatives of the EU Member States and chaired by a non-voting European Commission representative. The European Parliament also has a related “droit de regard”. The European Parliament’s role is to ensure that the European Commission has not exceeded its powers in deciding to grant or refuse to grant a marketing authorization. 
 The European Commission may grant a so-called “marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances.” Such authorization is intended for products for which the applicant can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Consequently, marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following: 
  
• | the applicant must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radiopharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the package leaflet and any medical information must draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is subject to annual review to reassess the risk-benefit balance in an annual reassessment procedure. Continuation of the authorization is linked to the annual reassessment and a negative assessment could potentially result in the marketing authorization being suspended or revoked. The renewal of a marketing authorization of a medicinal product under exceptional circumstances, however, follows the same rules as a “normal” marketing authorization. Thus, a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is granted for an initial five years, after which the authorization will become valid indefinitely, unless the EMA decides that safety grounds merit one additional five-year renewal. 
 The European Commission may also grant a so-called “conditional marketing authorization” prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (i) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (iii) the product fulfills an unmet medical need and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. 
 The EU medicines rules expressly permit the EU Member States to adopt national legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale, supply or use of any medicinal product containing, consisting of or derived from a specific type of human or animal cell, such as embryonic stem cells. While the products we have in development do not make use of embryonic stem cells, it is possible that the 
 44

national laws in certain EU Member States may prohibit or restrict us from commercializing our products, even if they have been granted an EU marketing authorization. 
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the Concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. 
 The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State. 
 Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union 
 In the EU, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abridged) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
 A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a drug can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 45

Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity 
 Regulatory Requirements after a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained 
 In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: 
  
• | Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and EU Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty, being March 29, 2019. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom. 
 
The United Kingdom has a period of a maximum of two years from the date of its formal notification to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal from, and future relationship with, the EU. If no formal withdrawal agreement is reached between the United Kingdom and the EU, then it is expected the United Kingdom’s membership in the EU will automatically terminate two years after the submission of the notification of the United Kingdom’s intention to withdraw from the EU. Discussions between the United Kingdom and the EU focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements are ongoing. However, limited progress to date in these negotiations and ongoing uncertainty within the UK Government and Parliament sustains the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the EU on March 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption.
 General Data Protection Regulation
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements 
 46

relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater.  The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.  Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
 Pricing Decisions for Approved Products 
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 81 full-time employees, including a total of 25 employees with M.D., Pharm.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 55 employees are engaged in research and development. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
Reorganization 
 We are a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on November 10, 2016 under the name RaNA Therapeutics, Inc. On December 5, 2016, we completed a series of transactions, which we refer to as the “Reorganization,” pursuant to which RaNA Therapeutics, LLC, or RaNA LLC, became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of RaNA Therapeutics, Inc., and all of the outstanding equity securities of RaNA LLC were exchanged for equity securities of RaNA Therapeutics, Inc. The purpose of the Reorganization was to reorganize our corporate structure so that our existing investors would own capital stock in a corporation rather than equity interests in a limited liability company. On June 26, 2017, we changed our name from RaNA Therapeutics, Inc. to Translate Bio, Inc. On December 19, 2017, RaNA LLC merged with and into Translate Bio, Inc., with Translate Bio, Inc. continuing as the surviving corporation.
