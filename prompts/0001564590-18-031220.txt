 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
 Mesa Airlines is a regional air carrier providing scheduled passenger service to 110 cities in 39 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, Mexico, Cuba and the Bahamas. All of our flights are operated as either American Eagle or United Express flights pursuant to the terms of capacity purchase agreements we entered into with American Airlines, Inc. (“American”) and United Airlines, Inc. (“United”) (each, our “major airline partner”). We have a significant presence in several of our major airline partners’ key domestic hubs and focus cities, including Dallas, Houston, Phoenix and Washington-Dulles.
 As of September 30, 2018, we operated a fleet of 145 aircraft with approximately 730 daily departures. We operate 64 CRJ-900 aircraft under our capacity purchase agreement with American (our “American Capacity Purchase Agreement”) and 20 CRJ-700 and 60 E-175 aircraft under our capacity purchase agreement with United (our “United Capacity Purchase Agreement”). For our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, approximately 44% of our aircraft in scheduled service were operated for American and approximately 56% were operated for United. All of our operating revenue in our 2018, 2017 and 2016 fiscal years was derived from operations associated with our American and United Capacity Purchase Agreements. 
 Our long-term capacity purchase agreements provide us guaranteed monthly revenue for each aircraft under contract, a fixed fee for each block hour and flight actually flown, and reimbursement of certain direct operating expenses in exchange for providing regional flying on behalf of our major airline partners. Our capacity purchase agreements also shelter us, to an extent, from many of the elements that cause volatility in airline financial performance, including fuel prices, variations in ticket prices, and fluctuations in number of passengers. In providing regional flying under our capacity purchase agreements, we use the logos, service marks, flight crew uniforms and aircraft paint schemes of our major airline partners. Our major airline partners control route selection, pricing, seat inventories, marketing and scheduling, and provide us with ground support services, airport landing slots and gate access. 
 Regional aircraft are optimal for short and medium-haul scheduled flights that connect outlying communities with larger cities and act as “feeders” for domestic and international hubs. In addition, regional aircraft are well suited to serve larger city pairs during off-peak times when load factors on larger jets are low. The lower trip costs and operating efficiencies of regional aircraft, along with the competitive nature of the capacity purchase agreement bidding process, provide significant value to major airlines. According to the Regional Airline Association, we were the fourth largest regional airline in the United States in 2017, as measured by passenger enplanements, and our flights accounted for approximately 8.8% of a
ll passengers carried on U.S. regional airlines. 
 Regional airlines play a daily, essential role in the U.S. air travel system. According to the Regional Airline Association, 41% of all scheduled passenger flights in the United States in 2017 were operated by regional airlines. Of all the U.S. airports with scheduled passenger service, 63% are served exclusively by regional airlines. Some of the most popular U.S. airports have more than half of their scheduled departures made by regional aircraft, including New York-LaGuardia, Philadelphia, Washington-Dulles, Charlotte, Houston-Bush and Chicago-O’Hare.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that our primary strengths are:
 Low-Cost Operator. We believe that we are among the lowest cost operators of regional jet service in the United States. There are several key elements that contribute to our cost efficiencies:

• | Efficient Fleet Composition. We exclusively operate large regional aircraft with 70+ passenger seats on a single FAA certificate. Operating large regional aircraft allows us to enjoy unit cost advantages over smaller regional aircraft. Larger regional aircraft require less fuel and crew resources per passenger carried, and may also have maintenance cost efficiencies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cost Effective, Long-Term Collective Bargaining Agreements. Our pilots and flight attendants ratified new four-year collective bargaining agreements effective as of July 13, 2017 and October 1, 2017, respectively, which are among the longest in the regional airline industry and include labor rate structures through 2023 for our pilots and 2022 for our flight attendants. We believe that our collective bargaining agreements and favorable labor relationships are critical for pilot retention and will provide more predictable labor costs into 2023.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low Corporate Overhead. Our general and administrative expenses per block hour have decreased by more than 32% over the five-year period ended September 30, 2018. We have significantly reduced our overhead costs by operating with a modest administrative and corporate team, offering cost-effective benefit programs and implementing automated solutions to improve efficiency.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4

 
• | Competitive Procurement of Certain Operating Functions. We have long-term maintenance agreements with expirations extending from December 2020 to December 2027 with AAR Aircraft Services, Inc. (“AAR”), GE Engine Services, LLC. (“GE”), StandardAero Limited (“StandardAero”), Aviall Services, Inc. (“Aviall”) and Bombardier Aerospace (“Bombardier”), respectively, to provide parts procurement, inventory and engine, airframe and component overhaul services. We expect that our long-term agreements with these and other strategic vendors will provide predictable high-quality and cost-effective solutions for most maintenance categories over the next several years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Recruitment and Retention. We believe that we are well positioned to attract and retain qualified pilot candidates. 
 
We believe our recent success in pilot recruiting will continue with the introduction of our Career Path Program (“CPP”) with United. In addition to offering competitive compensation, bonuses and benefits, we believe the following elements contribute to our recruiting advantage:

• | Career Path Program. In March 2018 we announced our CPP with United, which is designed to provide our qualified current and future pilots a path to employment as a pilot at United. We believe that our CPP will help us continue to attract qualified pilots, manage natural attrition and further strengthen our decades-long relationship with United.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Modern, Large-Gauged Regional Jets. We exclusively operate large regional aircraft with advanced flight deck avionics. We believe that pilot candidates prefer advanced flight deck avionics because they are similar to those found in the larger commercial aircraft types flown by major airlines.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Opportunities for Advancement. We believe that our career progression is among the most attractive in the regional airline industry. During fiscal 2018, our pilots had the opportunity to be promoted from first officer to captain in as little as 12 months.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stable Labor Relations. Throughout our long operating history, we believe that we have had constructive relationships with our employees and their labor representatives. We have never been the subject of a labor strike or labor action that impacted our operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enthusiastic and Supportive Culture. Our “pilots helping pilots” philosophy helps us attract, retain and inspire our next generation of pilots. Our team-oriented culture, as demonstrated by the mentorship of our senior pilots, is both encouraged and expected. We strive to create an environment for our personnel where open communication is customary and where we celebrate our successes together.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Stable, Long-Term Revenue-Guarantee Capacity Purchase Agreements. We have long-term capacity purchase agreements with American and United that extend beyond 2020 for 94 of our 144 aircraft in scheduled service (with 34 aircraft expiring between June and December 2019 and 16 aircraft expiring between January and August 2020, if not extended prior to contract expiration). Both of our capacity purchase agreements are “capacity purchase,” rather than revenue sharing arrangements. This contractual structure provides us with a predictable revenue stream and allows us to increase our profit margin to the extent that we are able to lower our operating costs below the costs anticipated by the agreements. In addition, we are not exposed to price fluctuations for fuel, certain insurance expenses, ground operations or landing fees as those costs are either reimbursed under our capacity purchase agreements or paid directly to suppliers by our major airline partners.
 Fleet Exclusively Comprised of Large, Efficient Regional Jets. We exclusively operate large regional aircraft with 70+ passenger seats. These aircraft are the highest in demand across the regional airline industry and provide us with best-in-class operating efficiencies, providing our major airline partners greater flexibility in route structuring and increased passenger revenues. As of September 30, 2018, we had 145 aircraft (owned and leased) consisting of the following:
 
 
 | Embraer Regional Jet-175 (76 seats)(1) | | Canadair Regional Jet-700 (70 seats) | | Canadair Regional Jet-900 (76-79 seats) | Canadair Regional Jet-200 (50 seats)(2) | Total | 
---------------+----------------------------------------+----+--------------------------------------+----+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+-------+--
American Eagle | | — | | — | | 64 | | — | 64 
United Express | | 60 | | 20 | | — | | — | 80 
Subtotal | | 60 | | 20 | | 64 | | — | 144
Unassigned | | — | | — | | — | | 1 | 1 
Total | | 60 | | 20 | | 64 | | 1 | 145


(1) | In February 2018, we mutually agreed with United to temporarily remove two aircraft from service under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement. These aircraft were placed back in service in July 2018 and are reflected here.

Longstanding Relationships with American and United. We began flying for American, through its predecessor entities, in 1992 and United in 1991. Since 2013, we have added 26 aircraft to our American Capacity Purchase Agreement and 60 aircraft to our United Capacity Purchase Agreement.
 Strong Recent Record of Operational Performance. We were ranked the number one regional airline for on-time performance by DOT Air Travel Consumer Report for three of the first nine months of 2018, which was equal to or better than any other regional airline. In addition, we believe that we were the number one regional airline for on-time performance in 2016 and 2017 based on a comparison of our internal data to publicly available DOT data for reporting airlines. Under our capacity purchase agreements, we may receive financial incentives or incur penalties based upon our operational performance, including controllable on-time departures and controllable completion percentages.
 Experienced, Long-Tenured Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive operating experience in the regional airline industry. Our Chief Executive Officer and President/Chief Financial Officer have served us in senior officer positions since 1998, and our management team has helped us navigate through and emerge successfully from bankruptcy in early 2011. 
 Our Business Strategy
 Our business strategy consists of the following elements:
 Maintain Low-Cost Structure. We have established ourselves as a low cost, efficient and reliable provider of regional airline services. We intend to continue our disciplined cost control approach through responsible outsourcing of certain operating functions, by flying large regional aircraft with associated lower maintenance costs and common flight crews across fleet types, and through the diligent control of corporate and administrative costs implementing company-wide efforts to improve our cost position. Additionally, we expect our long-term collective bargaining agreements to protect us from significant labor cost increases over the next five years. These efficiencies, coupled with the low average seniority of our pilots, has enabled us to compete aggressively on price in our capacity purchase agreement negotiations.
 Attractive Work Opportunities. We believe our employees have been, and will continue to be, a key to our success. Our ability to attract, recruit and retain pilots has supported our industry-leading fleet growth. We intend to continue to offer competitive compensation packages, foster a positive and supportive work environment and provide opportunities to fly state-of-the-art, large-gauged regional jets to differentiate us from other carriers and make us an attractive place to work and build a career.
 Maintain a Prudent and Conservative Capital Structure. We intend to continue to maintain a prudent capital structure. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet and credit profile will enable us to optimize terms with lessors and vendors and, when preferred by our major airline partners, allow us to procure and finance aircraft on competitive terms. We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in August 2018. We intend to use a portion of the IPO proceeds to purchase some of our leased aircraft. The purchase of these leased aircraft will allow us to lower our operating costs and avoid lease-related use restrictions and return conditions. We also intend to use a portion of the IPO proceeds to repay certain higher interest debt and refinance the balance at a reduced interest rate.
 
Minimize Tail Risk. We have structured our aircraft leases and financing arrangements to minimize or eliminate, as much as possible, so-called “tail risk,” which is the amount of aircraft-related lease obligations or projected negative equity existing beyond the term of that aircraft’s corresponding capacity purchase agreement. As of September 30, 2018, we had 18 aircraft with leases extending past the term of their corresponding capacity purchase agreements with an aggregate exposure of less than $33.0 million and no financing arrangements with projected negative equity. We intend to continue to align the terms of our aircraft leases and financing agreements with the terms of our capacity purchase agreements in order to maintain low “tail risk.”
 Aircraft Fleet
 We fly only large regional jets manufactured by Bombardier and Embraer S.A. (“Embraer”). Operating large regional aircraft allows us to enjoy operational, recruiting and cost advantages over other regional airlines that operate smaller regional aircraft.
 The following table lists the aircraft we own and lease as of September 30, 2018:
 
 
Type of Aircraft | Owned | | Leased | | | Total | | Passenger Capacity
---------------------+-------+----+--------+----+----+-------+----+-------------------
E-175 Regional Jet | | 18 | | 42 | | (1) | 60 | | 76 | 
CRJ-900 Regional Jet | | 48 | | | 16 | | | 64 | 76/79 | 
CRJ-700 Regional Jet | | 8 | | | 12 | | | 20 | | 70
CRJ-200 Regional Jet | | 1 | | | 0 | | | 1 | | 50
Total | | 75 | | | 70 | | | 145 | | 


(1) | These aircraft are owned by United and leased to us at nominal amounts.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bombardier and Embraer regional jets are among the quietest commercial jets currently available and offer many of the amenities of larger commercial jet aircraft, including flight attendant service, a stand-up cabin, overhead and under seat storage, lavatories and in-flight snack and beverage service. The speed of Bombardier and Embraer regional jets is comparable to larger aircraft operated by major airlines, and they have a range of approximately 1,600 miles and 2,100 miles, respectively. We do not currently have any existing arrangements with Bombardier or Embraer to acquire additional aircraft.
 Route Network
 As of September 30, 2018, we served 110 airports throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Cuba and the Bahamas. Our flight schedules are structured to facilitate the connection of our passengers with the flights of our major airline partners at their hub airports and to maximize local and connecting service to other carriers. Under our American and United Capacity Purchase Agreements, market selection, pricing and yield management functions are performed by our respective major airline partners.
Capacity Purchase Agreements
 Our capacity purchase agreements consist of the following:
  
• | Operation of CRJ-900 aircraft under our American Capacity Purchase Agreement; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operation of CRJ-700 and E-175 aircraft under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The financial arrangement underlying our American and United Capacity Purchase Agreements includes a revenue-guarantee arrangement. Under the revenue-guarantee provisions of our capacity purchase agreements, our major airline partners pay us a fixed minimum monthly amount per aircraft under contract, plus additional amounts related to departures and block hours flown. We also receive direct reimbursement of certain operating expenses, including insurance. Other expenses, including fuel and ground operations are directly paid to suppliers by our major airline partners. We believe we are in material compliance with the terms of our capacity purchase agreements and enjoy good relationships with our major airline partners.
 We benefit from our capacity purchase agreements and revenue guarantees because we are sheltered, to an extent, from some of the elements that cause volatility in airline financial performance, including variations in ticket prices, fluctuations in number of passengers and fuel prices. However, we do not benefit from positive trends in ticket prices (including ancillary revenue programs), the number of passengers enplaned or reductions in fuel prices. Our major airline partners retain all revenue collected from passengers carried on our flights. In providing regional flying under our capacity purchase agreements, we use the logos, service marks and aircraft paint schemes of our major airline partners.
 The following table summarizes our available seat miles (“ASMs”) flown and contract revenue recognized under our capacity purchase agreements for our fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively:
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, 2018 | | Year Ended September 30, 2017 | 
---------+-------------------------------+-----------+-------------------------------+--
 | Available Seat Miles | | Contract Revenue | | | Contract Revenue per ASM | | Available Seat Miles | Contract Revenue | | Contract Revenue per ASM | 
 | (in thousands) | | (in thousands) | 
American | | 4,417,228 | | $ | 359,467 | | ¢ | 8.14 | | 4,427,870 | | $ | 354,614 | ¢ | 8.01

American Capacity Purchase Agreement
 As of September 30, 2018, we operated 64 CRJ-900 aircraft for American under our American Capacity Purchase Agreement. In exchange for providing flight services under our American Capacity Purchase Agreement, we receive a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft under contract plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown during each month. In addition, we may also receive incentives or incur penalties based upon our operational performance, including controllable on-time departures and controllable completion percentages. American also reimburses us for certain costs on an actual basis, including passenger liability and hull insurance and aircraft property taxes, all as set forth in our American Capacity Purchase Agreement. Other expenses, including fuel and certain landing fees, are directly paid to suppliers by American. In addition, American also provides, at no cost to us, certain ground handling and customer service functions, as well as airport-related facilities and gates at American hubs and cities where we operate.
 7

Our American Capacity Purchase Agreement establishes minimum levels of flight operations.  In prior periods, the FAA Qualification Standards (as defined below) have negatively impacted our ability to hire pilots at a rate sufficient to support required utilization levels, and, as a result, we have issued credits to American pursuant to the terms of our American Capacity Purchase Agreement. For our fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we issued credits of approximately $5.2 million and $6.0 million, respectively, under our American Capacity Agreement.
 Our American Capacity Purchase Agreement will terminate with respect to different tranches of aircraft between 2021 and 2025, unless otherwise extended or amended. American has the option to unilaterally extend the term of our American Capacity Purchase Agreement up to three times for one year each (on the same terms) with respect to certain aircraft by providing us prior written notice. Our American Capacity Purchase Agreement is subject to termination prior to that date, subject to our right to cure, in various circumstances including:
  
• | If either American or we become insolvent, file for bankruptcy or fail to pay our debts as they become due, the non-defaulting party may terminate the agreement;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Failure by us or American to perform the covenants, conditions or provisions of our American Capacity Purchase Agreement, subject to 15 days’ notice and cure rights;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If we are required by the FAA or the DOT to suspend operations and we have not resumed operations within three business days, except as a result of an emergency airworthiness directive from the FAA affecting all similarly equipped aircraft, American may terminate the agreement;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If our controllable flight completion factor falls below certain levels for a specified period of time, subject to our right to cure; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Upon a change in our ownership or control without the written approval of American.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the event that American has the right to terminate our American Capacity Purchase Agreement, American may, in lieu of termination, withdraw up to an aggregate of 14 aircraft from service under our American Capacity Purchase Agreement. Upon any such withdrawal, American’s payments to us would be correspondingly reduced by the number of withdrawn aircraft.
 As of September 30, 2018, American held 10.5% of our outstanding common stock (or 7.2% on a fully-diluted basis), which interest American received in exchange for an extension of our capacity purchase agreement during our bankruptcy proceeding. 
 United Capacity Purchase Agreement
 As of September 30, 2018, we operated 20 CRJ-700 and 60 E-175 aircraft for United under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement. In exchange for providing the flight services under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement, we receive a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft under contract plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown and the results of passenger satisfaction surveys. United also reimburses us for certain costs on an actual basis, including property tax per aircraft and passenger liability insurance. Other expenses, including fuel and certain landing fees, are directly paid to suppliers by United. We also receive a minimum profit margin based upon our operational performance. Under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement, United has purchased 42 of the 60 E-175 aircraft and leases them to us at nominal amounts. United reimburses us on a pass-through basis for all costs related to heavy airframe and engine maintenance, landing gear, auxiliary power units (“APUs”) and component maintenance for the 42 E-175 aircraft owned by United.
 Our United Capacity Purchase Agreement permits United, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of certain costs tied to aircraft type, to terminate the agreement in its discretion, or remove aircraft from service, by giving us notice of 90 days or more. In February 2018, we mutually agreed with United to temporarily remove two aircraft from service under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement. In July 2018, we were able to fully staff flight operations and these aircraft were placed back into service under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement. During the temporary removal, we agreed to pay the lease costs associated with the two E-175 aircraft, which totaled $1.9 million as of September 30, 2018. If United elects to terminate our United Capacity Purchase Agreement in its entirety or permanently remove select aircraft from service, we are permitted to return any of the affected E-175 aircraft leased from United at no cost to us. In addition, if United removes any of our 18 owned E-175 aircraft from service at its direction, United would remain obligated to assume the aircraft ownership and associated debt with respect to such aircraft through the end of the term of the agreement.
 Our United Capacity Purchase Agreement expires between June and December 2019 with respect to 34 CRJ-700 and E-175 aircraft, between January and August 2020 with respect to 16 E-175 aircraft, and between 2021 and 2028 with respect to 30 of our E-175 aircraft, subject to United’s early termination rights and right to extend (on the same terms) for a total of four additional two-year terms. We intend to work with United to extend our United Capacity Purchase Agreement with respect to these aircraft, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to extend the agreement at acceptable rates, on acceptable terms, or at all.
 8

Our United Capacity Purchase Agreement is subject to early termination under various circumstances noted above and including:
  
• | By United if certain operational performance factors fall below a specified percentage for a specified time, subject to notice under certain circumstances;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | By United if we fail to perform the material covenants, agreements, terms or conditions of our United Capacity Purchase Agreement or similar agreements with United, subject to thirty (30) days’ notice and cure rights;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If either United or we become insolvent, file bankruptcy or fail to pay debts when due, the non-defaulting party may terminate the agreement; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | By United if we merge with, or if control of us is acquired by another air carrier or a corporation directly or indirectly owning or controlling another air carrier.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintenance and Repairs
 A key element of our business and low-cost strategy is the responsible outsourcing of certain aircraft maintenance and other operating functions. We use competitive bidding among qualified vendors to procure these services on the best possible terms. In March 2014, August 2015 and January 2017, we entered into long-term maintenance contracts with AAR to provide fixed-rate parts procurement and component overhaul services for our aircraft fleet. Under these agreements, AAR provides maintenance and engineering services on any aircraft that we designate during the term of the agreement, along with access to spare parts inventory pool in exchange for a fixed monthly fee. Our agreements with AAR expire in 2026, unless earlier terminated for cause. We have not experienced difficulty obtaining spare parts on a timely basis for our aircraft fleet. As of September 30, 2018, $51.0 million of parts inventory was consigned to us by AAR under long-term contracts that is not reflected on our balance sheet.
 In July 2012, we entered into a heavy check maintenance contract with Bombardier, to perform heavy check maintenance on our CRJ-700 and CRJ-900 aircraft, which extends through November 2020.
 In July 2013, we entered into an engine maintenance contract with GE to perform heavy maintenance on certain CRJ-700 and CRJ-900 engines based on a fixed pricing schedule. The pricing may escalate annually in accordance with GE’s spare parts catalog for engines. The engine maintenance contract extends through 2024.
 In 2014, we entered into a ten-year contract with Aviall to provide maintenance and repair services on the wheels, brakes and tires of our CRJ-700 and CRJ-900 aircraft. Under the agreement, we pay Aviall a fixed “cost per landing” fee for all landings of our aircraft during the term of the agreement, which fee is subject to annual adjustment based on increases in the cost of labor and component parts. As of September 30, 2018, $7.1 million of parts inventory was consigned to us by Aviall under long-term contracts that is not reflected on our balance sheet.
 We entered into an engine maintenance contract with StandardAero, which became effective on June 1, 2015, to perform heavy maintenance on certain CRJ-700 and CRJ-900 engines based on a fixed pricing schedule. The pricing may escalate annually in accordance with GE’s spare parts catalog for engines. The engine maintenance contract extends through 2020.
 Apart from our outsourcing of certain maintenance functions, we have a FAA mandated and approved maintenance program. Our maintenance technicians undergo extensive initial and recurrent training. Aircraft maintenance and repair consists of routine and non-routine maintenance, and work performed is divided into three general categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance and component service.
 Line maintenance consists of routine daily and weekly scheduled maintenance checks on our aircraft. We categorize our line maintenance into four stations and each line maintenance station is categorized by the scope and complexity of work performed. Line maintenance is performed in Dallas, Houston, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. and represents the majority of and most extensive maintenance we perform.
 Major airframe maintenance checks consist of a series of more complex tasks that can take from one to four weeks to accomplish and typically are required approximately every 28 months, on average across our fleet. Engine overhauls and engine performance restoration events are quite extensive and can take two months. We maintain an inventory of spare engines to provide for continued operations during engine maintenance events. We expect to begin the initial planned engine maintenance overhauls on our new engine fleet approximately four to six years after the date of manufacture and introduction into our fleet, with subsequent engine maintenance every four to six years thereafter. Due to our current fleet size, we believe outsourcing all of our heavy maintenance, engine restoration and major part repair, is more economical than performing this work using our internal maintenance team.

Competition
 We consider our competition to be those U.S. regional airlines that currently hold or compete for capacity purchase agreements with major airlines. Our competition includes, therefore, nearly every other domestic regional airline, including Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation; Endeavor Air, Inc. (owned by Delta) (“Endeavor”); Envoy Air, Inc. (“Envoy”), PSA Airlines, Inc. (“PSA”) and Piedmont Airlines, Inc. (“Piedmont”) (Envoy, PSA and Piedmont are owned by American); Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (owned by Alaska Air Group, Inc.) (“Horizon”); SkyWest Inc., parent of SkyWest Airlines, Inc. and ExpressJet Airlines, Inc.; Republic Airways Holdings Inc.; and Trans States Airlines, Inc. 
 Major airlines typically offer capacity purchase arrangements to regional airlines on the basis of the following criteria: availability of labor resources; proposed contract economic terms; reliable and on-time flight operations; corporate financial resources including ability to procure and finance aircraft; customer service levels; and other factors.
 Certain of our competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. Moreover, economic downturns, combined with competitive pressures, have contributed to a number of reorganizations, bankruptcies, liquidations and business combinations among major and regional carriers. The effect of economic downturns is somewhat mitigated by our reliance on capacity purchase agreements with revenue-guarantee provisions, but the renewal and continued profitability of these partnerships with our major airline partners is not guaranteed.
 Seasonality
 Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year, since the airline industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations and general economic conditions. Our operations are somewhat favorably affected by increased utilization of our aircraft in the summer months and are unfavorably affected by increased fleet maintenance and by inclement weather during the winter months.
Aircraft Fuel
 Our capacity purchase agreements provide that our major airline partners source, procure and directly pay third-party vendors for all fuel used in the performance of those agreements. Accordingly, we do not recognize fuel expenses or revenues for flying under our capacity purchase agreements and we face very limited exposure to fuel price fluctuations.
Insurance
 We maintain insurance policies we believe are of types customary in the airline industry and as required by the DOT, lessors and other financing parties and our major airline partners under the terms of our capacity purchase agreements. The policies principally provide liability coverage for public and passenger injury; damage to property; loss of or damage to flight equipment; fire; auto; directors’ and officers’ liability; advertiser and media liability; cyber risk liability; fiduciary; workers’ compensation and employer’s liability; and war risk (terrorism). Although we currently believe our insurance coverage is adequate, we cannot assure you that the amount of such coverage will not be changed or that we will not be forced to bear substantial losses from accidents.
Employees
 As of September 30, 2018, we employed approximately 3,412 employees, consisting of 1,358 pilots or pilot recruits, 1,287 flight attendants, 55 flight dispatchers, 426 mechanics and 286 employees in administrative roles. Our continued success is partly dependent on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have never been the subject of a labor strike or labor action that materially impacted our operations.
 FAA regulations require pilots to have an Airline Transport Pilot (“ATP”) license with specific ratings for the aircraft to be flown, and to be medically certified as physically fit to fly. FAA and medical certifications are subject to periodic renewal requirements including recurrent training and recent flying experience. Mechanics, quality-control inspectors, and flight dispatchers must be certificated and qualified for specific aircraft. Flight attendants must have initial and periodic competency training and qualification. Training programs are subject to approval and monitoring by the FAA. Management personnel directly involved in the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance, and aircraft inspection must also meet experience standards prescribed by FAA regulations. All safety-sensitive employees are subject to pre-employment, random, and post-accident drug testing.
 The airline industry has from time to time experienced a shortage of qualified personnel, particularly with respect to pilots and maintenance technicians. In addition, as is common with most of our competitors, we have faced considerable turnover of our employees. Regional airline pilots, flight attendants and maintenance technicians often leave to work for larger airlines, which generally offer higher salaries and better benefit programs than regional airlines are financially able to offer. During fiscal 2017, we experienced higher than average turnover as a result of pilot wage increases at certain other regional air carriers and expanded hiring by major carriers. Should the turnover of employees, particularly pilots, sharply increase, the result will be significantly higher training costs than otherwise would be necessary and we may need to request a reduced flight schedule with our major airline partners, 
 10

which may result in operational performance penalties under our capacity purchase agreements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to recruit, train and retain the qualified employees that we need to carry out our expansion plans or replace departing employees.
 As of September 30, 2018, approximately 77.5% of our employees were represented by labor unions under collective-bargaining agreements, as set forth below. No other employees of ours or our subsidiaries are parties to any other collective bargaining agreement or union contracts.
 
 
Employee Groups | Number of Employees | | Representative | | Labor Agreement Expiration | 
------------------+---------------------+-------+----------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------+----------
Pilots | | 1,358 | | Air Line Pilots Association | | 7/13/2021 | (1)
Flight Attendants | | 1,287 | | Association of Flight Attendants | | 10/1/2021 | (2)

(1) | On July 13, 2017, our pilots ratified a new four-year collective bargaining agreement.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | On October 1, 2017, our flight attendants also ratified a new four-year collective bargaining agreement.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Railway Labor Act (“RLA”) governs our relations with labor organizations. Under the RLA, the collective bargaining agreements generally do not expire, but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, they must notify the other party in the manner agreed to by the parties. Under the RLA, after receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last for many months, and even for a few years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential Emergency Board (“PEB”) may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another “cooling off” period of 30 days. At the end of a “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to “self-help,” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent “self-help” by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties. The table above sets forth our employee groups and status of the collective bargaining agreements.
 Safety and Security
 We are committed to the safety and security of our passengers and employees. We have taken many steps, both voluntarily and as mandated by governmental authorities, to increase the safety of our operations. Some of the safety and security measures we have taken with our major airline partners include: aircraft security and surveillance, positive bag matching procedures, enhanced passenger and baggage screening and search procedures, and securing of cockpit doors. We are committed to complying with future safety and security requirements.
 Our ongoing focus on safety relies on training our employees to proper standards and providing them with the tools and equipment they require so they can perform their job functions in a safe and efficient manner. Safety in the workplace targets several areas of our operation including: dispatch, flight operations and maintenance.
 The TSA and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, each a division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports, and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from U.S. international flights are subject to customs, border, immigration and similar requirements of equivalent foreign governmental agencies. We are currently in compliance with all directives issued by such agencies. We maintain active, open lines of communication with the TSA at all of our locations to ensure proper standards for security of our personnel, equipment and facilities are exercised throughout the operation.
 11

Facilities
 In addition to aircraft, we have office and maintenance facilities to support our 

operations. Each of our facilities are summarized in the following table:


 
Type | Location | Ownership | Approximate Square Feet | 
-----------------------------+----------------------+-----------+-------------------------+-------
Corporate Headquarters | Phoenix, Arizona | Leased | | 33,770
Office, Hangar and Warehouse | El Paso, Texas | Leased | | 31,292

Our corporate headquarters and training facilities in Phoenix, Arizona are subject to long-term leases expiring on November 30, 2025 and May 31, 2025, respectively.
 We believe our facilities are suitable and adequate for our current and anticipated needs.
 Foreign Ownership
 Under DOT regulations and federal law, we must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens. The restrictions imposed by federal law and regulations currently require that at least 75% of our voting stock must be owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by persons or entities who are U.S. citizens, as defined in the Federal Aviation Act, that our president and at least two-thirds of the members of our Board of Directors and other managing officers be U.S. citizens, and that we be under the actual control of U.S. citizens. In addition, at least 51% of our total outstanding stock must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens and no more than 49% of our stock may be held, directly or indirectly, by persons or entities who are not U.S. citizens and are from countries that have entered into “open skies” air transport agreements with the U.S. which allow unrestricted access between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country. We are currently in compliance with these ownership provisions. As of September 30, 2018, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 10,614,990 shares of our common stock, with an exercise price of $0.004 per share.  There were 250,000 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $3.20 per share that were terminated in June 2018. The warrants are not exercisable in violation of the restrictions imposed by federal law requiring that no more than 24.9% of our stock be voted, directly or indirectly, or controlled by persons who are not U.S. citizens. 
Government Regulation
 Aviation Regulation
 The DOT and FAA have regulatory authority over air transportation in the United States and all international air service is subject to certain U.S. federal requirements and approvals, as well as the regulatory requirements of the appropriate authorities of the foreign countries involved. The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity, exemptions and other economic authority required for airlines to provide domestic and foreign air transportation. International routes and international code-sharing arrangements are regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. A U.S. airline’s ability to operate flights to and from international destinations is subject to the air transport agreements between the United States and the foreign country and the carrier’s ability to obtain the necessary authority from the DOT and the applicable foreign government.
 The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries, which allow broad access between the United States and the applicable foreign country. With certain other countries, however, the United States has a restricted air transportation agreement. Our international flights to Mexico are governed by a recently implemented liberalized bilateral air transport agreements which the DOT has determined has all of the attributes of an “open skies” agreement. Our flights to Canada, Cuba and the Bahamas are governed by bilateral air transport agreements between the United States and such countries. Changes in U.S., Mexican, Canadian, Cuban or Bahamian aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of the corresponding air transport agreement, or otherwise affect our operations to and from these countries. In particular, there is still a degree of uncertainty about the future of scheduled commercial flight operations between the United States and Cuba as a result of changes in diplomatic relations between the two governments, as well as travel and trade restrictions implemented by the U.S. government in 2017. We are largely sheltered from the economic impact changes to existing “open skies” agreements or volatility in U.S., Mexican, Canadian, Cuban or Bahamian aviation polices because our major airline partners control route selection and scheduling under our capacity purchase agreements.
 12

The FAA is responsible for regulating and overseeing matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including the control of navigable air space, the qualification of flight personnel, flight training practices, compliance with FAA airline operating certificate requirements, aircraft certification and maintenance requirements and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA requires each commercial airline to obtain and hold an FAA air carrier certificate. We currently hold an FAR-121 air carrier certificate.
 Airport Access
 Flights at three major domestic airports are regulated through allocations of landing and takeoff authority (i.e., “slots” and “operating authorizations”) or similar regulatory mechanisms, which limit take-offs and landings at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period. In the United States, the FAA currently regulates the allocation of slots, slot exemptions, operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at two of the airports we serve, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in Washington, D.C. and New York’s LaGuardia Airport (LGA). In addition, John Wayne Airport (SNA) in Orange County, California, has a locally imposed slot system. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations, which are obtained by our major airline partners.
Consumer Protection Regulation
 The DOT also has jurisdiction over certain economic issues affecting air transportation and consumer protection matters, including unfair or deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition, lengthy tarmac delays, air carriers, airline advertising, denied boarding compensation, ticket refunds, baggage liability, contracts of carriage, customer service commitments, customer complaints and transportation of passengers with disabilities. The DOT frequently adopts new consumer protection regulations, such as rules to protect passengers addressing lengthy tarmac delays, chronically delayed flights, capacity purchase disclosure and undisclosed display bias, and is reviewing new guidelines to address the transparency of airline non-ticket fees and refunding baggage fees for delayed checked baggage. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements, code-sharing agreements (where an airline places its designator code on a flight operated by another airline) and wet-leasing agreements (where one airline provides aircraft and crew to another airline) between carriers and regulates other economic matters such as slot transactions.
Environmental Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection matters. These laws and regulations govern such matters as environmental reporting, storage and disposal of materials and chemicals and aircraft noise. We are, and expect in the future to be, involved in various environmental matters and conditions at, or related to, our properties. We are not currently subject to any environmental cleanup orders or actions imposed by regulatory authorities. We are not aware of any active material environmental investigations related to our assets or properties.
Other Regulations
 Airlines are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters. Labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the RLA. The privacy and security of passenger and employee data is regulated by various domestic and foreign laws and regulations.
 The U.S. government and foreign governments may consider and adopt new laws, regulations, interpretations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect our results of operations. We cannot predict what laws, regulations, interpretations and policies might be considered in the future, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business.
 Legal Proceedings
 We are subject to commercial and employment litigation claims and to administrative and regulatory proceedings and reviews. We currently believe that the ultimate outcome of such claims, proceedings and reviews will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Additionally, from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory oversight in the ordinary course of our business.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Mesa Air Group, Inc.
 Opinion on the Financial Statements
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mesa Air Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

MESA AIR GROUP, INC. 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (Unaudited) 
  
1. | Organization and Operations
---+----------------------------

The Company 
 Mesa Air Group, Inc. (“Mesa” or the “Company”) is a holding company whose principal subsidiary operates as a regional air carrier, providing scheduled passenger service. As of September 30, 2018, the Company served 110 cities in 39 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, Mexico, Cuba and the Bahamas, and operated a fleet of 145 aircraft with approximately 730 daily departures. 
 The Company’s airline operations are conducted by its regional airline subsidiary, Mesa Airlines, Inc. (“Mesa Airlines”), providing services to major air carriers under capacity purchase agreements. Mesa Airlines operates as American Eagle under a capacity purchase agreement with American Airlines, Inc. (“American”) and as United Express under a capacity purchase agreement with United Airlines, Inc. (“United”). All of the Company’s consolidated contract revenues for years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were derived from operations associated with these two capacity purchase agreements. 
 The financial arrangements between the Company and its major airline partners involve a revenue-guarantee arrangement (i.e. a “capacity purchase agreement”) whereby the major airline pays a monthly guaranteed amount for each aircraft under contract, a fixed fee for each block hour and flight flown and reimbursement of certain direct operating expenses in exchange for providing regional flying. The major airline partners also pay certain expenses directly to suppliers, such as fuel, ground operations and certain landing fees. Under the terms of these capacity purchase agreements, the major airline controls route selection, pricing and seat inventories, thereby reducing the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in passenger traffic, fare levels, and fuel prices. 
 On August 8, 2018, the Company filed its Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which, among other things: (i) effected a 2.5-for-1 stock split of its common stock; and (ii) increased the authorized number of shares of its common and preferred stock to 125,000,000 and 5,000,000, respectively. All references to share and per share amounts in the Company’s consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively revised to reflect the stock split and increase in authorized shares.
 On August 14, 2018, the Company completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of its common stock, in which it issued and sold 9,630,000 shares (the “Firm Shares”) of common stock at a public offering price of $12.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $115.6 million. Additionally, in connection with the IPO, the Company granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 1,444,500 shares of common stock at the same price.  On September 11, 2018, the Company closed the sale of 1,344,500 shares (“Option Shares”) of its common stock, in connection with the partial exercise of the overallotment option granted to the underwriters in its IPO. Of the 1,344,500 Option Shares sold, 723,985 were purchased directly from the Company and the remaining 620,515 shares were purchased directly from the selling shareholders. The Firm Shares and Option Shares were sold to the public for a price of $12.00 per share. 
 The sale of these shares raised gross proceeds of approximately $124,247,820. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Option Shares by the selling shareholders. 
 As part of the IPO, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) previously issued under the Mesa Air Group, Inc. Amended and Restated Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (the “SAR Plan”), which settled only in cash, were cancelled and exchanged for an aggregate of 1,266,034 shares of restricted common stock under the Company’s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”) (see note 12), of which 966,022 were fully vested upon issuance and are included in the number of shares of common stock outstanding after the IPO. Of the 966,022 fully vested shares, 314,198 shares were retained by the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations, resulting in a net issuance of 651,824 shares. Additionally, 983,113 shares of restricted common stock were issued to certain of its employees and directors under its 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of 491,915 shares of existing unvested restricted phantom stock units and 491,198 shares of restricted stock under the 2011 and 2017 Plans, respectively.
 American Capacity Purchase Agreement 
 As of September 30, 2018, the Company operated 64 CRJ-900 aircraft for American under a capacity purchase agreement. Unless otherwise extended or amended, the capacity purchase agreement for the aircraft expires between 2021 and 2025. In exchange for providing flights and all other services under the agreement, the Company receives a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft, plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours (the number of hours during which the aircraft is in revenue service, measured from the time of gate departure before take-off until the time of gate arrival at the destination) flown during the month. In addition, the Company may also receive incentives or pay penalties based upon the Company’s operational performance, including controllable on-time departure and controllable completion percentages. American also reimburses the Company for the actual amount incurred for certain items such as passenger liability and hull insurance, and aircraft property taxes. In addition, American also provides, at no cost to the Company, certain ground handling and customer service functions, as well as airport-related facilities and fuel. The Company also receives a monthly profit margin payment from American based on the number 
 64

of aircraft operating. The capacity purchase agreement is subject to early termination for cause under specified circumstances and subject to the Company’s right to cure under certain conditions. American had a 7.2% and 10.6% ownership interest in the Company, calculated on a fully-diluted basis as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The related party amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations pertain to American. 
 United Capacity Purchase Agreement 
 As of September 30, 2018, the Company operated 20 CRJ-700 and 60 E-175 aircraft for United under a capacity purchase agreement. Subject to certain early termination rights, the capacity purchase agreement for each of the 20 CRJ-700 aircraft expires between August and December 2019. Subject to early termination rights, the capacity purchase agreement for 30 of the E-175 aircraft (owned by United) expires between June 2019 and August 2020, subject to United’s right to extend for four additional two-year terms (maximum of eight years). Subject to early termination rights, the capacity purchase agreement for 18 of the E-175 aircraft (owned by Mesa) expires between January 2028 and November 2028. During fiscal 2017, the Company and United expanded the capacity purchase agreement to include, subject to early termination rights, an additional 12 E-175 aircraft (purchased by United) with the aircraft entering service through January 2018 for five-year terms, subject to United’s right to extend for four additional two-year terms (maximum of eight years). In exchange for performing the flight services under such agreement, the Company receives from United a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft, plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown during the month. Additionally, certain costs incurred by the Company in performing the flight services are “pass-through” costs, whereby United agrees to reimburse the Company for the actual amounts incurred for the following items: property tax per aircraft, landing fees, and additionally for the E-175 aircraft owned by United, heavy airframe and engine maintenance, landing gear, APUs and component maintenance. The Company also receives a profit margin based upon certain reimbursable costs under the agreement, as well as its operational performance in addition to a fixed profit margin. The capacity purchase agreement is also subject to early termination for cause under specified circumstances and subject to the Company’s right to cure under certain circumstances. United is also permitted, subject to certain conditions, to terminate the agreement early in its discretion by giving us notice of 90 days or more. 
 In February 2018, the Company mutually agreed with United to temporarily remove two aircraft from service under its United capacity purchase agreement until the Company was able to fully staff flight operations. During the temporary removal, the Company agreed to pay the lease costs associated with the two E-175 aircraft, which totaled $1.9 million as of September 30, 2018. In June 2018, the Company was able to fully staff flight operations and these two E-175 aircraft were placed back into service under the United capacity purchase agreement. 
  
2. | Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
---+-------------------------------------------

Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative United States generally accepted accounting principles as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”) and may remain an emerging growth company until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO, subject to specified conditions. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. The Company has elected to “opt out” of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 65

Segment Reporting 
 Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In consideration of ASC 280, “Segment Reporting,” we are not organized around specific services or geographic regions. We currently operate in one service line providing scheduled passenger services in accordance with our capacity purchase agreements. 
 While we operate under two separate capacity purchase agreements, we do not manage our business based on any performance measure at the individual contract level. Additionally, our chief operating decision maker uses consolidated financial information to evaluate our performance, which is the same basis on which he communicates our results and performance to our Board of Directors. He bases all significant decisions regarding the allocation of our resources on a consolidated basis. Based on the information described above and in accordance with the applicable literature, management has concluded that we are organized and operated as one operating and reportable segment. 
 All of our operating revenue in our 2018, 2017 and 2016 fiscal years was derived from operations associated with our American and United Capacity Purchase Agreements.  It is currently impractical to provide certain information on our revenue from our customers for each of our services and geographic information on our revenues and long lived assets.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 Marketable Securities
 The Company’s investments in marketable securities are deemed by management to be available-for-sale and are reported at fair market value. The Company’s holdings of marketable securities as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $19.9 million and $0, respectively.
Restricted Cash 
 Restricted cash primarily includes deposits in trust accounts to collateralize letters of credit and to fund workers’ compensation claims, landing fees, and other business needs. Restricted cash is stated at cost, which approximates fair value. 
 The Company has an agreement with a financial institution for a $6.0 million letter of credit facility to issue letters of credit for landing fees, workers’ compensation insurance, and other business needs. Pursuant to such agreement, $3.8 million and $3.6 million of outstanding letters of credit are required to be collateralized by amounts on deposit as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which are classified as restricted cash. 
 Expendable Parts and Supplies 
 Expendable parts and supplies are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or market, and are charged to expense as they are used. The Company provides an allowance for obsolescence for such parts and supplies over the useful life of its aircraft after considering the useful life of each aircraft fleet, the estimated cost of expendable parts expected to be on hand at the end of the useful life, and the estimated salvage value of the parts. This allowance was $1.8 million and $1.6 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Prepaid Expenses 
 Prepaid expenses consist primarily of the excess of aircraft lease payments over the straight-lined lease expense. The straight-lined lease expense is net of estimated rebates to be received from the lessor during the term of the agreements, contingent on the Company performing certain engine restorations. 
Property and Equipment 
 Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of manufacturer incentives, and depreciated over their estimated useful lives to their estimated salvage values, which are 20% for aircraft and rotable spare parts, using the straight-line method. 
 66

Estimated useful lives of the various classifications of property and equipment are as follows:
 
 
Property and Equipment | Estimated Useful Life 
-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------
Buildings | 30 years 
Aircraft | 25 years from manufacture date 
Flight equipment | 7-20 years 
Equipment | 5-9 years 
Furniture and fixtures | 3-5 years 
Vehicles | 5 years 
Rotable spare parts | Life of the aircraft or term of the lease, whichever is less
Leasehold improvements | Life of the aircraft or term of the lease, whichever is less

 Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired. The Company records an impairment loss if (i) the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, and (ii) the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds fair value. If an impairment loss has occurred, a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. The Company recognized no impairment charges on property and equipment for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company accounts for assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting standards that define fair value and establish a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
 Accounting standards include disclosure requirements relating to the fair values used for certain financial instruments and establish a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes valuation inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of three levels: 
  
• | Level 1 – Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level 2 – Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level 3 – Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prepaid Maintenance Deposits 
 Prepaid maintenance deposits consist of payments made on a monthly basis to cover certain future maintenance events for leased flight equipment. The deposits are contractual obligations that are held in trust by the lessors. The deposits are only to be used to cover maintenance events, which include, among other things, C-checks, engine restoration events, engine life limited parts, landing gear repairs, and auxiliary power unit overhauls. The Company expenses the service as it is performed and receives reimbursement from the reserve trust account. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the noncurrent portion is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 
Debt Financing Costs 
 Debt financing costs consist of payments made to issue debt related to the purchase of aircraft, flight equipment, and certain flight equipment maintenance costs. The Company defers the costs and amortizes them over the term of the debt agreement. Debt financing costs related to a recognized debt liability are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. Debt financing costs with no related recognized debt liability are presented as assets, with the current portion included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the noncurrent portion included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 67

Unutilized Manufacturer Credits 
 Manufacturer credits received in connection with aircraft purchases that can be used for the future purchase of certain goods and services are recorded as a prepaid asset based on the value of the credits expected to be utilized, and the Company reduces the asset as the credits are utilized to fund such purchases. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the noncurrent portion is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 
Intangibles 
 In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, an intangible asset with a finite life that is being amortized is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired. The Company records an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset and if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds fair value. If an impairment loss has occurred, a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. 
Other Assets 
 Other long-term assets primarily consist of noncurrent deferred reimbursed costs, debt financing costs, and prepaid maintenance deposits. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in future years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records deferred tax assets for the value of benefits expected to be realized from the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, and state and federal net operating loss carryforwards. The Company periodically reviews these assets to determine the likelihood of realization. To the extent the Company believes some portion of the benefit may not be realizable, an estimate of the unrealized position is made and a valuation allowance is recorded. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. 
Deferred Credits 
 Deferred credits consist of cost reimbursements from major airline partners related to aircraft modifications per revised capacity purchase agreements and costs associated with pilot training. The deferred credits are amortized on a straight-line basis as a component of revenue over the term of the respective capacity purchase agreements. 
Other Noncurrent Liabilities 
 Other noncurrent liabilities consist of the remaining fair value adjustment for unfavorable aircraft operating leases related to a previous bankruptcy and related accounting. This adjustment to fair value is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining initial lease terms for these aircraft. During each of the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded amortization of this unfavorable lease liability of $6.6 million, $6.8 million, and $6.8 million, respectively, as a reduction of lease expense. During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company wrote off $1.2 million of unfavorable lease liability related to the lease termination of its aircraft lease facility with Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National Association, as owner trustee and lessor (the “GECAS Lease Facility”), which was accounted for as lease termination expense.
Revenue Recognition 
 Under the Company’s capacity purchase agreements, the major airline partners generally pay a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft, plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown. The contracts also include reimbursement of certain costs incurred by the Company in performing flight services. These costs, known as “pass-through costs,” may include passenger and hull insurance, aircraft property taxes, as well as landing fees and catering. Additionally, for the E-175 aircraft owned by United, the capacity purchase agreement provides that United will reimburse the Company for heavy airframe and engine maintenance, landing gear, auxiliary power units (“APU”) and component maintenance which are treated as pass-through and will increase revenue (and expense for the same amount) upon completion of the work. The Company also receives compensation under its capacity purchase agreements for heavy maintenance expenses at a fixed hourly rate or per aircraft rate for all aircraft in scheduled service other than the E-175 aircraft owned by United. The Company records reimbursement of pass-through costs as pass-through and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations as service is provided. In addition, the Company’s major 
 68

airline partners also provide, at no cost to the Company, certain ground handling and customer service functions, as well as airport-related facilities and gates at their hubs and other cities. Services and facilities provided by major airline partners at no cost to the Company are presented net in the Company’s consolidated financial statements; hence, no amounts are recorded for revenue or expense for these items. The contracts also include a profit margin on certain reimbursable costs, as well as a profit margin, incentives and penalties based on certain operational benchmarks. The Company recognizes revenue under its capacity purchase agreements when the transportation is provided, including an estimate of the profit component based upon the information available at the end of the accounting period. All revenue recognized under these contracts is presented as the gross amount billed to the major airline partners. 
 Under the Company’s capacity purchase agreements with American and United, the Company is reimbursed under a fixed rate per block hour, plus an amount per aircraft designed to reimburse the Company for certain aircraft ownership costs. The Company has concluded that a component of its revenue under these agreements is rental income, as such agreements identify the “right of use” of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period of time. The Company calculates the amount of rental income using the contractual ownership rates set forth in the respective capacity purchase agreements. The amount deemed to be rental income during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $217.0 million, $217.6 million and $190.1 million, respectively, and has been included in contract revenue on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The Company has not separately stated aircraft rental income and aircraft rental expense in the consolidated statements of operations because the use of the aircraft is not a separate activity of the total service provided. 
 Our American and United Capacity Purchase Agreements contain an option that allows the major airline partner to assume the contractual responsibility for procuring and providing the fuel necessary to operate the flights that the Company operates for them. Both airlines have exercised this option. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize fuel expense or revenue for fuel on passenger flight services. 
 
Maintenance Expense 
 The Company operates under an FAA approved continuous inspection and maintenance program. The Company uses the direct expense method of accounting for its maintenance of regional jet engine overhauls, airframe, landing gear, and normal recurring maintenance wherein the expense is recognized when the maintenance work is completed, or over the period of repair, if materially different. For leased aircraft, the Company is subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the “life” of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date. The Company estimates the cost of maintenance lease return obligations and accrues such costs over the remaining lease term when the expense is probable and can be reasonably estimated. 
 Engine overhaul expense totaled $51.2 million, $64.0 million and $90.9 million for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which $12.3 million, $0.3 million and $0 million was pass-through expense. Airframe check expense totaled $21.5 million, $22.6 million and $13.2 million for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which $7.5 million, $4.9 million and $0 million was pass-through expense.
 Pursuant to the United capacity purchase agreement, United reimburses the Company for heavy maintenance on certain E-175 aircraft. Those reimbursements are included in pass-through and other revenue. See Note 1: “Organization and Operations” for further information.
 Aircraft Leases
 In addition to the aircraft we receive from United under our Capacity Purchase Agreement, approximately 19% of our aircraft are leased from third parties. In order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease, we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments. These estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease. All of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases, which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the term of the related leases. Additionally, operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and accordingly, neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. In the event that we or one of our major airline partners decide to exit an activity involving leased aircraft, losses may be incurred. In the event that we exit an activity that results in exit losses, these losses are accrued as each aircraft is removed from operations for early termination penalties, lease settle up and other charges. See “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” below for a discussion of a new accounting standard that is likely to have an impact on our aircraft lease accounting beginning in 2019.

Change in Accounting Policy 
  Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”) and Phantom Stock historically were accounted for as liability compensatory awards under ASC 710, Compensation – General, valued using the intrinsic value method, as permitted by ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, for nonpublic entities. Upon becoming a public company, as defined in ASC 718, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company was required to change its methodology for valuing the SARs and Phantom Stock. The SARs and Phantom Stock were re-measured at each quarterly reporting date and were accounted for prospectively at fair value using a Black-Scholes fair value pricing model until they were converted to restricted stock awards upon completion of the Company’s IPO. The Company recorded the impact of the change in valuation methods as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, as permitted by ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The effect of the change increased the SARs and Phantom Stock liability by $2.4 million which was the difference in compensation cost measured using the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. An equal and offsetting change to retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet was recorded with the revaluation. Any future changes in fair value were recorded as compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Upon completion of the Company’s IPO the SARs and Phantom Stock were cancelled and exchanged for shares of restricted stock under our 2018 Plan.
Correction of Immaterial Misstatement 
 Subsequent to the issuance of the Company’s 2016 consolidated financial statements, management determined that a payment the Company received in 2017 of $4.6 million from a former vendor for engine maintenance support credits should have been recorded as a receivable and a reduction in engine maintenance expense in prior years, and also identified other minor prior period adjustments for under-accrued property tax. Accordingly, the Company made a prior period adjustment to increase retained earnings by $2.3 million as of September 30, 2015 and adjusted accounts receivable, accrued property taxes, and deferred tax liability (for related income tax effects) as of September 30, 2016, to correct such amounts. These adjustments had no effect on the Company’s previously-reported results of operations or net cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2016. The Company evaluated these adjustments considering both quantitative and qualitative factors and concluded they were immaterial to previously issued financial statements.

3. | Recent Accounting Pronouncements
---+---------------------------------

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”). The standard establishes a new recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU 2014-09 allows the Company to apply the standard either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new standard, making it effective for our reporting periods beginning October 1, 2018. Under the new standard, the Company concluded that individual flights are distinct services and these flight services promised in a capacity purchase agreement represent a series of services that should be accounted for as a single performance obligation, recognized over time as the flights are completed. We do not expect ASU 2014-09 to have a material impact to our financial statements. The Company anticipates applying the standard as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We will continue to monitor industry activities and any additional guidance provided by regulators, standards setters, or the accounting profession and adjust our assessment and implementation plans accordingly.
 In August 2014, The FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Topic 205), which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the consolidated financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosure if “conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.” The update applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. The Company adopted this ASU in fiscal year 2017, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which provides guidance requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for substantially all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. Leases will be classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
 70

In March of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). With this standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are required to be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of the year ended September 30, 2018. This change in accounting principle has been applied on a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of fiscal year 2018 as a cumulative-effect adjustment increasing deferred tax assets by $0.4 million, increasing income tax expense by $0.3 million, and increasing retained earnings by $0.7 million. Adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have any other material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force), which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact to its financial statements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 that requires restricted cash and cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects the adoption of ASU 2016-18 to have no effect on our consolidated statements of operations or its consolidated balance sheets. ASU 2016-18 is expected to only result in a change in presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company has restricted cash of $3.8 million and $3.6 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and intends to adopt the new guidance in fiscal 2019. 
  
4. | Concentrations
---+---------------

 At September 30, 2018, the Company had capacity purchase agreements with American and United. All of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and accounts receivable at the end of September 30, 2018 and 2017 was derived from these agreements. The terms of both the American and United capacity purchase agreements are not aligned with the lease obligations on the aircraft performing services under such agreements. 
 Amounts billed by the Company under capacity purchase agreements are subject to the Company’s interpretation of the applicable capacity purchase agreement and are subject to audit by the Company’s major airline partners. Periodically, the Company’s major airline partners dispute amounts billed and pay amounts less than the amount billed. Ultimate collection of the remaining amounts not only depends upon the Company prevailing under the applicable audit, but also upon the financial well-being of the major airline partner. As such, the Company periodically reviews amounts past due and records a reserve for amounts estimated to be uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.3 million and $0.7 million at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If the Company’s ability to collect these receivables and the financial viability of our partners is materially different than estimated, the Company’s estimate of the allowance could be materially impacted. 
 American accounted for approximately 54%, 56% and 64% of the Company’s total revenue for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. United accounted for approximately 46%, 44% and 36% of the Company’s total revenue for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A termination of either the American or the United capacity purchase agreement would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

 The Company recorded amortization of the unfavorable lease liability amounting to $6.6 million, $6.8 million and $6.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a reduction to lease expense. During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company wrote off $1.2 million of unfavorable lease liability related to the lease termination of its aircraft lease facility with Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National Association, as owner trustee and lessor (the “GECAS Lease Facility”), which was accounted for as lease termination expense. 
  
7. | Fair Value Measurements
---+------------------------

 The Company did not measure any of its assets or liabilities at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2018 and 2017.
 The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable included on the consolidated balance sheets approximated fair value at September 30, 2018 and 2017. 
 The Company’s debt agreements are not traded on an active market. The Company has determined the estimated fair value of its debt to be Level 3, as certain inputs used to determine the fair value of these agreements are unobservable and, therefore, could be sensitive to changes in inputs. The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of Level 3 debt. 
 72

The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities, were as follows (in millions): 
 
 
 | September 30, 2018 | | September 30, 2017 |

The net book value of collateralized aircraft and equipment as of September 30, 2018 was $1,047.6 million. 
 In December 2015, an Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (“EETC”) pass-through trust was created to issue pass-through certificates to obtain financing for new E-175 aircraft. At September 30, 2018, Mesa has $209.2 million of equipment notes outstanding issued under the EETC financing included in long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. The structure of the EETC financing consists of a pass-through trust created by Mesa to issue pass-through certificates, which represent fractional undivided interests in the pass-through trust and are not obligations of Mesa. 
 The proceeds of the issuance of the pass-through certificates were used to purchase equipment notes which were issued by Mesa and secured by its aircraft. The payment obligations under the equipment notes are those of Mesa. Proceeds received from the sale of pass-through certificates were initially held by a depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until Mesa issued equipment notes to the trust, which purchased such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds. 
 Mesa evaluated whether the pass-through trust formed for its EETC financing is a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) and required to be consolidated. The pass-through trust was determined to be a VIE, however, the Company has determined that it does not have a variable interest in the pass-through trust, and therefore, has not consolidated the pass-through trust with its financial statements. 
 On June 27, 2018, the Company refinanced $16.0 million of debt on six CRJ-900 aircraft (due in 2019), with $27.5 million of debt, resulting in net cash proceeds to the Company of $10.4 million after transaction related fees. The notes payable require quarterly payments of principal and interest through fiscal 2022 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 3.50%. 
 On June 28, 2018, the Company purchased nine CRJ-900 aircraft, which were previously leased under the GECAS Lease Facility, for $76.5 million. The Company financed the aircraft purchase with $69.6 million in new debt and proceeds from the June 2018 refinancing of six CRJ-900 aircraft. The notes payable of $69.6 million require quarterly payments of principal and interest through fiscal 2022 bearing interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 3.50% for the senior promissory notes to 7.50% for the subordinated promissory notes. The Company recorded non-cash lease termination expense of $15.1 million in connection with the lease buyout. Also, as part of the transaction, the Company (i) received $4.5 million of future goods and services credits and $5.6 million of loan forgiveness for loans with a maturity date in 2027 from the aircraft manufacturer, and (ii) mutually agreed with GE Capital Aviation Services LLC to terminate the GE Warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock. 
 On August 14, 2018 the Company paid down the outstanding balance on the CIT Revolving Credit Facility of $25.7 million.

9. | Earnings Per Share
---+-------------------

 Calculations of net income per common share were as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, | 
---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+-------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016
Net income | $ | 33,255 | | $ | 32,828 | | $ | 14,920
Basic weighted average common shares outstanding | | 13,516 | | | 10,919 | | | 9,558 
Add: Incremental shares for: | | | | | | | | 
Dilutive effect of warrants | | 11,492 | | | 12,369 | | | 14,451
Dilutive effect of restricted stock | | 163 | | | 98 | | | 73 
Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding | | 25,171 | | | 23,386 | | | 24,082
Net income per common share | | | | | | | | 
Basic | $ | 2.46 | | $ | 3.01 | | $ | 1.56 
Diluted | $ | 1.32 | | $ | 1.40 | | $ | 0.62 

 
Basic income per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Mesa Air Group by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 
 The number of incremental shares from the assumed issuance of shares relating to restricted stock and exercise of warrants is calculated by applying the treasury stock method. Share-based awards and warrants whose impact is considered to be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method were excluded from the diluted net income or loss per share calculation. In loss periods, these incremental shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share, as the inclusion of unvested restricted stock and warrants would have an anti-dilutive effect. There were no anti-dilutive shares relating to restricted stock and exercise of warrants that were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
  
10. | Common Stock
----+-------------

 The Company previously issued warrants to third parties, which had a five-year term to be converted to common stock at an exercise price of $0.004 per share. Outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock are held by persons who are not U.S. citizens. The warrants are not exercisable due to restrictions imposed by federal law requiring that no more than 24.9% of our stock be voted, directly or indirectly, or controlled by persons who are not U.S. citizens. The warrants can be converted to common stock upon warrant holders demonstrating U.S. citizenship. During June 2018, the Company extended the term of outstanding warrants set to expire by five years (through fiscal year 2023). Any warrants that were not extended were forfeited. 
 On June 28, 2018, the Company agreed with GE Capital Aviation Services LLC (“GE Capital”) to terminate a warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock held by GE Capital. Our shares of common stock became listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “MESA” effective August 10, 2018. 
 In July 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors and Compensation Committee approved the issuance of shares of restricted common stock under its 2018 Plan immediately following completion of the Company’s IPO to certain of its employees and directors in exchange for the cancellation of existing restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs. The shares of restricted common stock issued under the 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs are subject to vesting on the same terms set forth in the prior vesting schedules and are not subject to acceleration in connection with the 2018 Plan issuances. 
 On August 8, 2018, the Company filed its Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which, among other things: (i) effected a 2.5-for-1 stock split of its common stock; and (ii) increased the authorized number of shares of its common and preferred stock to 125,000,000 and 5,000,000, respectively. All references to share and per share amounts in the Company’s consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively revised to reflect the stock split and increase in authorized shares.

On August 14, 2018, the Company completed its IPO, in which it issued and sold 9,630,000 shares of common stock, no par value, at a public offering price of $12.00 per share (the “Firm Shares”). Additionally, in connection with the IPO, the Company granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 1,444,500 shares of common stock at the same price.  On September 11, 2018, the Company closed the sale of 1,344,500 shares (“Option Shares”) of its common stock, in connection with the partial exercise of the overallotment option granted to the underwriters in its IPO. Of the 1,344,500 Option Shares sold, 723,985 were purchased directly from the Company and the remaining 620,515 shares were purchased directly from the selling shareholders. The Firm Shares and Option Shares were sold to the public for a price of $12.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the IPO were approximately $124.2 million. We received $111.7 million in net proceeds after deducting $8.7 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and $3.8 million in offering costs.
 We have not historically paid dividends on shares of our common stock. Additionally, our RASPRO Lease Facility and GECAS Lease Facility contain restrictions that limit our ability to or prohibit us from paying dividends to holders of our common stock.

The Company's deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:
 
 
 | Years Ended September 30, | 
------------------------------------+---------------------------+---------
 | 2018 | | | 2017 |

Total deferred tax liabilities | $ | (145,823 | ) | | $ | (190,655 | )
Net deferred tax liability | $ | (39,797 | ) | | $ | (56,436 | )

 We have federal and state income tax NOL carryforwards of $415.1 million and $199.6 million, which expire in 2027-2037 and 2019-2038, respectively.
 We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state NOL carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $1.9 million in fiscal year 2018 and $2.6 million in fiscal year 2017 on the deferred tax assets related to these state NOL carryforwards. If or when recognized, the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense.
 The federal and state NOL carryforwards in the income tax returns filed included unrecognized tax benefits. The deferred tax assets recognized for those NOLs are presented net of these unrecognized tax benefits.
 Because of the change of ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, use of a portion of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be limited in future periods. Further, a portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities.  The initial public offering in August of 2018 resulted in a change in ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Based on the valuation of the Company's stock as of the initial public offering date, the Company does not believe any limitation on the utilization of the Company's current net operating losses would be applicable as of September 30, 2018.
 As a result of adopting ASU 2016-09, the table of deferred tax assets and liabilities includes $0.4 million of deferred tax assets previously unrecognized that arose directly from, or the use of which was postponed by, tax deductions related to equity compensation greater than the compensation recognized for financial reporting. These previously recognized deferred tax assets are related to excess tax benefits incurred in years prior to September 30, 2018.
 
The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:
 
 
 | Years Ended September 30, | 
--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+-------
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | | 2016
 | (in thousands) | 
Unrecognized tax benefits — October 1 | $ | 7,547 | | | $ | 7,547 | | | 7,547
Gross increases — tax positions in prior period | | — | | | | — | | | — 
Gross decreases — tax positions in prior period | | (2,859 | ) | | | — | | | — 
Gross increases — tax positions in current period | | — | | | | — | | | — 
Settlement | | — | | | | — | | | — 
Lapse of statute of limitations | | — | | | | — | | | — 
Unrecognized tax benefits — September 30 | $ | 4,688 | | | $ | 7,547 | | $ | 7,547

 78

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits are $4.7 million, $7.5 million and $7.5 million of tax benefits as of September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that, if recognized, would result in adjustments to primarily deferred taxes. The decrease in the year ended September 30, 2018 is a result of the change in federal tax rate that reduces the benefit that would be recognized if the unrecognized tax benefit was resolved favorably.
 We recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense. We have not recorded accrued penalties or interest related to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above as the amounts would result in an adjustment to NOL carry forwards.
 We are subject to taxation in the United States and various states.  As of September 30, 2018, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state examinations by taxing authorities for years prior to 1999.
 On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affected the Company’s fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, including but not limited to (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate, (2) changing rules related to uses and limitations of NOL carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, and (4) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property. The Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% in our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The Internal Revenue Code stipulates that the Company’s fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, will have a blended corporate tax rate of 24.5%, which is based on the applicable tax rates before and after the Tax Act and the number of days in the year.
 The SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act.
 In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we have recorded a discrete net tax benefit of $22.0 million in the period ending September 30, 2018. As discussed more fully below, the Company has not completed its accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act. The Company has recorded provisional adjustments where reasonable adjustments are available. Where reasonable adjustments are not available, the Company has not recorded any provisional adjustments and continues to account for them in accordance with ASC 740.
 Our accounting for the following elements of the Tax Act is complete:
 Reduction of U.S. federal corporate tax rate: The Act reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we have recorded a decrease related to our net deferred tax liabilities of $22.0 million, excluding the valuation allowance.  The Company has also estimated an increase to its valuation allowance of $0.5 million due to the rate change.  We have recorded a corresponding net adjustment to deferred income tax benefit of $21.5 million for the period ending September 30, 2018.  
 Elimination of Corporate AMT and Refund of AMT Credits: For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the corporate AMT was repealed.  The Act allows the use of existing corporate AMT credits to offset regular tax liability for tax years after December 31, 2017. AMT credits in excess of regular liability are refundable in the years 2018 through 2021.  At September 30, 2018, the Company had $2.5 million of AMT credits, all of which is expected to be refunded. We have reclassified the AMT credits to long-term receivable.
 The Company was not able to make reasonable estimates or, correspondingly, record provisional adjustments for the following:
 Valuation allowances: The Company must determine whether the state valuation allowance assessments are affected by various aspects of the Tax Act (e.g. section 163(j), state effect of The Act, net operating loss carryforwards). Any corresponding determinations relating to changes in valuation allowances have, likewise, not been completed or recorded. 
  
12. | Share-Based Compensation
----+-------------------------

Restricted Stock 
 In July 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors and Compensation Committee approved the issuance of shares of restricted common stock under its 2018 Plan immediately following the IPO to certain of its employees and directors in exchange for the cancellation of existing restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs. The shares of restricted common stock issued under the 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs are subject to 
 79

vesting on the same terms set forth in the prior vesting schedules and are not subject to acceleration in connection with the 2018 Plan issuances. There were 966,022 vested SARs which were cancelled, exchanged for shares of restricted common stock and issued as restricted stock upon completion of the IPO. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to issue 2,500,000 shares of common stock to management under the 2018 Plan. Immediately following the IPO, 2,249,147 shares were issued to certain of its employees and directors under the 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of 491,915 unvested restricted phantom stock units, 491,198 unvested restricted shares issued under the 2011 and 2017 Plans and 1,266,034 SARs (966,022 vested and 300,012 unvested).  The Company has the right to withhold shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations and the withheld shares become available for future grants. The shares are valued at grant date based upon recent share transactions. From inception of the 2011 Plan through IPO, 2,448,905 shares have been granted, 1,978,550 shares have vested and 470,355 shares have been cancelled.  From inception of the 2017 Plan, 31,255 shares have been granted, 10,412 have vested and 20,843 shares have been cancelled.  From inception of the 2018 Plan, 2,249,147 shares have been awarded and 998,522 shares have vested.

Stock Appreciation Rights 
 In 2014, the Company implemented a share-based payment plan under which certain executives and directors are eligible to receive grants of SARs (the “SARs Plan”). The SARs provide a participant with the right to receive the aggregate appreciation in stock price over the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant, payable in cash. The participant may exercise his or her SARs quarterly after the grant is vested but no later than 10 years after the date of grant. The SARs awards vest ratably over a three year period from the date of grant. The Company had authorized 5,000,000 shares under this plan and had granted 4,204,993 since 
 80

inception of the plan. Since inception of the plan, 3,687,218 of SARs have vested and 2,088,333 of SARs have been exercised. In August 2018, upon IPO, 517,775 unvested SARs and 1,598,885 vested SARs were cancelled in exchange for 300,012 and 966,022 shares of restricted stock under the 2018 Plan, respectively.

Phantom Stock 
 On October 17, 2017, the Company implemented a share-based payment plan under which employees, officers, directors and other individuals providing services to the Company are eligible to receive grants of restricted phantom stock units (“Phantom Stock Plan”). The restricted phantom stock units (“restricted stock units” or “RSUs”) provide a participant with the right to receive a cash or stock bonus based on the fair market value of a stated number of RSUs that are vested. The shares of Common Stock that may be subject to RSUs granted under the Plan shall not exceed an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares. All of the RSUs are non-vested and forfeitable as of the grant date and vest over a three-year period. Any vested RSU will be settled by the Company upon vesting but no later than March 15 of the calendar year after the date that the RSUs become vested. The Company had authorized 1,250,000 shares under this plan and had granted 536,538 since inception of the plan. Since inception of the plan, 44,623 RSUs have vested or settled. In August 2018, upon completion of our IPO, 491,915 unvested RSUs were cancelled in exchange for shares of restricted stock under the 2018 Plan.   
 The phantom stock activity for the year ended September 30, 2018 were summarized as follows:

Following the IPO there will be no further grants under the Stock Appreciation Rights and Phantom Stock plans. Immediately following the IPO, shares of restricted common stock were issued to certain of its employees and directors under its 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of existing restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs. The shares of restricted common stock issued under the 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs are subject to vesting on the same terms set forth in the prior vesting schedules and are not subject to acceleration in connection with the 2018 Plan issuances.
 
As of September 30, 2018, there was $8.8 million, of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. 
 Compensation cost for share-based awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Share-based compensation expense for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $12.9 million, $2.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expenses are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 
13. | Commitments
----+------------

 At September 30, 2018, the Company leased 28 aircraft under noncancelable operating leases with remaining terms of up to 5.5 years. The Company has the option to terminate certain leases at various times throughout the lease. The Company headquarters and other facility noncancelable operating leases have remaining terms of up to nine years. The leases require the Company to pay all taxes, maintenance, insurance, and other operating expenses. Rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, net of lessor rebates and other incentives. Aggregate rental expense under all operating aircraft, equipment and facility leases totaled approximately $85.9 million, $83.8 million and $84.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 Future minimum lease payments as of September 30, 2018, under noncancelable operating leases are as follows (in thousands):

The majority of the Company’s leased aircraft are leased through trusts that have a sole purpose to purchase, finance, and lease these aircraft to the Company; therefore, they meet the criteria of a variable interest entity. However, since these are single-owner trusts in which the Company does not participate, the Company is not at risk for losses and is not considered the primary beneficiary. Management believes that the Company’s maximum exposure under these leases is the remaining lease payments. 
  
14. | Contingencies
----+--------------

 The Company is involved in various legal proceedings (including, but not limited to, insured claims) and FAA civil action proceedings that the Company does not believe will have a material adverse effect upon its business, financial condition, or results of operations, although no assurance can be given to the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings.

15. | Selected Consolidated Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited)
----+-----------------------------------------------------------

 The following table sets forth certain unaudited selected consolidated financial information for each of the four quarters in the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. In management’s opinion, this unaudited consolidated quarterly selected information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and includes all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which management considers necessary for a fair presentation when read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes. We believe these comparisons of consolidated quarterly selected financial data are not necessarily indicative of future performance.
 Quarterly EPS may not total to the fiscal year EPS due to the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the end of each period reported and rounding.
