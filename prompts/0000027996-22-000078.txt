ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Our solutions help businesses pay and get paid, accelerate growth and operate more efficiently. We support millions of small businesses, thousands of financial institutions and hundreds of the world's largest consumer brands, while processing approximately $3 trillion in annual payment volume. We operate primarily in the U.S., but we also sell our products and services in Canada, Australia and portions of Europe and South America. We operate 4 business segments that are generally organized by product type. These segments provide the following products and services:

OUR STRATEGY

Our vision is to be a trusted leader in payments and data. To realize this vision, we will continue to leverage our strengths:
•Our customers – our products and services are utilized by customers of all sizes and maturities. We continue to benefit from a long heritage of offering trusted service to our customers, which in turn, fuels meaningful cash flow that is redeployed to invest in other areas of the company.
•World class payments and data products and platforms – we continue to make investments to build market-leading payments and data products and platforms that are proprietary to Deluxe, encouraging our customers to build their businesses on our platforms for the long-term.
•Scale – we believe our volumes for many of our service offerings enable us to offer per-unit costs and reliability superior to our competitors. We continue to focus on scaling our technology and product management capabilities.
•Recurring and reoccurring revenue – we will continue to focus on offering products and integrated platforms that generate recurring and reoccurring revenue streams.
•Sales and distribution channels – we have extensive market reach, with millions of small business and consumer customers and thousands of financial institution clients. We plan to continue to deploy our resources, including our sales force and our various strategic relationships, to cost-effectively reach customers.
Over the past 3 years, we made significant progress in the implementation of our "One Deluxe" strategy, moving from a traditional manufacturing “company of companies” to a more technologically-focused “company of products.” We continued to integrate the numerous technology platforms we acquired over the years through our various acquisitions, working toward a common, modern technology platform. Particularly, we have focused on employing world-class sales technology that provides a unified view of our customers, enabling us to bring the best of Deluxe to all of our customers. We also developed an enterprise-class sales organization, assembled a talented management team and built an organization focused on developing new and improved products. As a result, we have realized the benefit of significant new client wins in all of our segments, and we determined that we are well positioned to augment our business through meaningful acquisitions. In June 2021, we completed the acquisition of First American Payment Systems, L.P. (First American), a large-scale payments technology company that provides partners and merchants with comprehensive in-store, online and mobile payment solutions. This acquisition enables us to expand significantly in the fast-growing payments sector, a sector known for generating significant recurring revenues and cash flows, and revenue from our Payments segment now rivals that of our Checks segment. Since the acquisition, the First American business has been growing faster than its historical pace, as we have leveraged our strong sales organization and trusted client relationships. We now have an even stronger foundation from which to pursue future acquisitions that will allow us to potentially realize significant revenue synergies, and we believe that our combined scaled back-end processing will readily support incremental volume.
At the same time that we have been investing in our business, we continued efforts to lower costs and simplify and eliminate duplicative processes. During 2021, we continued to review our real estate footprint and we closed 16 facilities, in addition to the 24 facilities we closed during 2020. We are continually refining our operating model to match expected customer needs and anticipated volumes, as well as to gain efficiencies.

IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

Since early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) and its variants. The pandemic has had widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets and business practices. Measures to prevent its spread have impacted us in a number of ways, including an initial reduction in revenues in all of our segments while our customers limited certain of their activities, limited in-person contact with current and potential clients and the shifting of conferences and other sales and marketing events to virtual events. We are continually reviewing our policies and procedures as we navigate through the pandemic. Certain of our employees have continued to work from our facilities throughout the pandemic, where we adopted health screening, implemented social distancing and personal protective equipment requirements, enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures, and modified workspaces to reduce the potential for disease transmission. For those employees who were working from home, we have reopened our facilities and are encouraging employees to work in a hybrid environment, where employees have the flexibility to work when and where they are comfortable and most productive, while encouraging a collaborative environment.
Our revenue began to recover in the second half of 2021, as our customers began to resume a more normal level of activity. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners and communities, and there is substantial ongoing uncertainty as to the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. The extent of additional adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations will be dictated by 
the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, the impact of governmental actions imposed in response to the pandemic, and individuals' and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. Please refer to the Risk Factors discussion appearing in Part I, Item 1A of this report for a discussion of these factors and other risks affecting our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.

SALES AND MARKETING

Everyone sells at Deluxe. We employ a comprehensive "One Deluxe" go-to-market approach, deploying a unified sales team with a complete view of our customer relationships, with the goal of bringing the best of Deluxe to every customer. Our customers rely on our solutions and platforms at all stages of their lifecycle, from start-up to maturity (as illustrated below), allowing our business segments to help each other deliver greater value for our customers and enabling our customers to build their businesses on our platforms for the long-term.
Note: Illustration is not indicative of our full set of products and services.
We employ a multi-channel, demand-generation sales and marketing approach. This includes our enterprise account model, under which our sales force sells directly to financial institutions and major global brands. We also sell our products and services through scalable partnerships, enabling us to cost-effectively reach customers, specifically leveraging our financial institution partnerships, our e-commerce assets and other strategic partnerships. In addition, millions of in-bound customer contacts buying or re-ordering our products and services provide extensive cross-sell opportunities.

INDUSTRY TRENDS AND OUR COMPETITION

Payment solutions, including checks
The payments industry continues to expand and evolve, with digital payment vehicles and transaction volumes growing around the world. The industry is continuously changing, highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. The challenge for payment providers is to continually modernize their infrastructure to support new service offerings and to identify new revenue streams, as well as to invest in cloud computing and other digital technologies to more rapidly address evolving customer preferences. This pace of change puts pressure on payment providers to transform and adapt in order to remain competitive.
Competition in the payments industry is intense. We are competing against numerous financial technology (Fintech) companies, including independent payment processors, credit card processing firms and treasury management service providers, as well as financial institution in-house capabilities. Volume is the key to staying cost-competitive, as it allows us to drive scale in our operations, and breadth of services is critical to staying relevant to customers. We believe our competitive advantages are: our scalable platform, extensive distribution channels, superior end-customer experience, frictionless payments (i.e., non-disruptive for payer, and payment choices for payee), automated receivables management, strong balance sheet and trusted and respected brand. We also believe there is growth potential for our Medical Payments Exchange (MPX) and Deluxe Payments Exchange (DPX) platforms, which convert paper checks to digital payments.
Our Checks business remains an important part of our strategy. We believe there will continue to be demand for personal and business checks for the foreseeable future. However, the total number of checks written in the U.S. has been in decline since the mid-1990s. The cash flow generated by our Checks business partially self-funds our growth investments. Our check programs are also an important source of lead generation for cost-effective cross-selling of other products and services.
Our Checks business faces significant competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, check printing software vendors and certain significant retailers. Pricing continues to be competitive in our financial institution sales channel, as financial institutions seek to maintain their previous levels of profitability, even as check usage declines. We believe our competitive advantages come from our design and customization options, our quality and service, the trust our customers have in us and our strong financial position. In addition, we are implementing new digital and print-on-demand technology that we believe will allow us to implement new customer requirements faster and expand our premium check and overall print design options.
Cloud Solutions
Data-driven marketing – With increased competition among businesses to target and engage new and existing customers, the use of data-driven marketing has continued to increase and evolve. Competition in this industry is intense, with a wide variety of companies in the data solutions space, including advertising agencies, marketing technology firms, data aggregators and brokers, and source data providers. Adapting to new technology is a key challenge in this industry, along with hiring and retaining the right people. We must continually adapt to the changing needs of our customers and expand our offerings to provide a greater breadth of services.
We believe we have significant growth opportunity in this market. We continue to simplify and integrate our separate businesses operating in this market, monetize the significant amount of data we process across the company, invest in technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, and consolidate our data infrastructure to reduce costs. We also believe that our pay-for-performance offerings provide us a competitive advantage.
Web and hosted solutions – The market for web hosting services is highly competitive and commoditized. As such, significant spending on product development and customer acquisition is required to compete in this space, and value-added services differentiate the competition. The markets for our hosted SaaS solutions, including web design, logo design and business incorporation services, are also large, dynamic and highly competitive, with dominant integrated players, as well as niche providers. We believe that it is easy to find our service offerings online, they are simple to use and they are competitively priced. We also believe that we will better compete in these markets as we continue to optimize our suite of solutions to deliver more integrated offerings.
Promotional Solutions
The market for business forms and certain business accessories has been declining for several years, as continual technological improvements have provided businesses with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. Greater acceptance of electronic signatures has also contributed to the overall decline in printed products. The markets for business forms and promotional products are highly competitive and fragmented. Current and potential competitors include traditional storefront printing companies, office superstores, wholesale printers, online printing companies, small business product resellers and providers of custom apparel and gifts. We believe that our competitive advantages include our multi-channel experience, ease of use, deep sources of supply and branded merchandise. We also believe that, by expanding our product set and driving integration of physical and digital solutions, we will transition this segment to a technology-driven business that can respond quickly to market opportunities and differentiate us from our competitors. 

OUR OPERATIONS / SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES

We continue our focus on improving the customer experience by providing excellent service and quality, while increasing our productivity and reducing our costs. We accomplish this by embedding lean operating principles into our processes, while emphasizing a culture of continuous improvement. We have a shared services approach, which allows our businesses to leverage shared facilities to optimize capacity utilization and to enhance operational excellence. We continue to reduce costs by utilizing our assets and technologies more efficiently and by enabling employees to better leverage their capabilities and talents.
We take our commitment to sustainability seriously, focusing on 5 specific areas: 
•Energy – We were an early adopter of energy savings, and energy use in our facilities has declined 48% since 2007. We purchase green power for use in our facilities and we now produce all checks for financial institution customers using renewable energy. Over the years, we have dedicated capital to various projects in our facilities, including humidification, lighting and HVAC and control system retrofits, which have decreased our North American energy use and carbon footprint significantly. We implemented many of these same concepts during the recent construction of our 
new facilities in Atlanta and Minneapolis, including LED lighting, daylight harvesting strategies, optimized HVAC systems and material selections that reduce carbon input and increase recycled content.
•Transportation – We have taken steps to reduce the miles we transport our products and we have converted from truck to rail where possible to reduce carbon emissions. We changed the vehicles in our car fleet to a more fuel-efficient model, which saves approximately 27,000 gallons of fuel and reduces our C02 emissions by approximately 525,000 pounds in one year.
•Waste – We are focused on understanding the waste stream in each of our facilities, with the goal of reducing the amount of waste we generate and recycling as much of our waste stream as possible. We have moved from volume inventories of custom inks to mixing systems. This has greatly reduced waste stream processing, with better response times for customers. We plan to eliminate 100 conventional and digital presses and move to 6 large-scale variable, digital presses by 2023. We have already eliminated 60 of those 100 conventional presses in the last five years and have migrated more work to digital presses.
•Materials – Over 90% of our check and forms paper is purchased from Forest Stewardship Council-certified supplier mills. In addition, our vinyl checkbook covers are produced using a minimum of 45% post-industrial recycled material. We also employ rigorous recycling efforts, and we now remove on average over 4,800 tons of paper, 440 tons of cardboard, 65 tons of metal, and 53 tons of plastic out of landfills each year by being diligent through the segregation of our waste streams.
•Carbon – We continue to review every aspect of our business, from the materials we use in products to how we manage facilities, to the role we play in communities, to ensure our growth stems from sustainable practices. For several years, we have purchased wind energy credits to help support and enable the renewable energy industry and offset 80% of our U.S. electricity consumption.
Protecting the environment and our shared future is key to our business and to delivering the products our customers need. Our focus on sustainability also saves money for us and our clients as our operations continue to make ongoing efficiency gains.

CYBERSECURITY

We are a trusted partner to enterprises of all sizes, and this is a responsibility we take seriously. The secure and uninterrupted operation of our networks and systems, as well as the processing, maintenance and confidentiality of the sensitive information that resides on our systems, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Each year, we process hundreds of millions of records containing data related to individuals and businesses. In addition, many of our products are hosted solutions, and the amount of data we store for our customers on our servers, including personal, important business and other potentially sensitive information, has been increasing. Technology-based organizations such as ours are vulnerable to targeted attacks aimed at exploiting network and system applications or weaknesses. A successful cyberattack could result in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal information and data, cause interruptions in our operations, damage our reputation and deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services. It could also result in litigation, the termination of client contracts, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. 
We have implemented a risk-based information/cybersecurity program dedicated to protecting our data and solutions. Our privacy policies, together with associated controls and procedures, provide a comprehensive framework to inform and guide the handling of data. These programs dovetail with our information security program in a manner designed to ensure that any data we handle remains protected. We employ an in-depth defensive strategy, utilizing the concept of security layers and the CIA (confidential, integrity and availability) triad model. Our information security program is led by our Chief Information Security Officer and the Information Security department, which establishes the policies, standards and strategies to manage security risk. We devote significant resources to addressing security vulnerabilities through enhancing security and reliability features in our products and services, reviewing and auditing our systems against independent security control frameworks, such as ISO 27001, and performing regular segment and company-wide risk assessments that include company and industry threat data and security maturity assessments, and which inform our annual and multi-year cybersecurity strategies and our product security plans.
We have an Enterprise Risk Management Committee that is led by our Assurance and Risk Advisory Services group, our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Administrative Officer, with participation from our executive leadership team and senior-level staff, including our Chief Compliance Officer and our Chief Information Security Officer. This committee assesses and monitors our top enterprise risks, including cybersecurity, and provides quarterly updates to our board of directors. Our Chief Information Security Officer also provides periodic updates to our board of directors, which is responsible for ensuring we have implemented appropriate risk mitigation strategies, systems, processes and controls.
In the event a cybersecurity incident is identified, our Cyber Security Incident Response team will act in accordance with our Incident and Crisis Management Program to ensure communication to our executive leadership team and to coordinate the 
response to any incident. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Compliance Officer are responsible for assessing such incidents for materiality, ensuring that any required notification or communication occurs and determining, among other things, whether any prohibition on the trading of our common stock by insiders should be imposed prior to the disclosure of information about a material cybersecurity event. We maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage that insures us for costs resulting from cyber attacks, although this coverage may not reimburse us for all losses.
For more information on risks related to data security, see Item 1A, "Operational Risks – Security breaches, computer malware or other cyberattacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners could substantially damage our reputation, subject us to litigation and enforcement actions, and substantially harm our business and results of operations."

OUR MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS

The principal materials used in producing our main products are paper, plastics, ink, corrugated packaging and printing plate material, which we purchase from various sources. We also purchase stock business forms and promotional apparel produced by third parties. In addition, we have entered into agreements with third-party providers for delivery services and information technology services, including telecommunications, network server and transaction processing services, as well as various other services. We also rely on third parties to provide a portion of the data used to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including credit and non-credit data from the national credit bureaus and other data brokers.
During 2021, we engaged a third-party global sourcing group to help manage our supply chain. We believe that in the event one of our vendors fails to perform, we would be able to obtain an alternative source of supply. However, with recent stresses on the global supply change and labor market, we are taking steps to secure multiple sources of supply for certain of the materials and services we utilize. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to obtain an alternative source of supply, or that such supply could be obtained at current prices.

OUR HUMAN CAPITAL

Our most valuable asset is our employee-owners. As of December 31, 2021, we had 6,313 employees. Approximately 98% of our team is full-time employees, with 58% representing non-exempt roles working in production, processing or call center functions. We employ 5,645 employees in the United States, 551 employees in Canada and 117 employees in Australia and Europe. We are proud of our strong history of positive, productive employee relations. None of our employees are currently represented by labor unions.
The foundation of our continuing success as a Trusted Payments and Business TechnologyTM company is our ability to attract and retain diverse, exceptional and motivated talent. We accomplish this by providing a culture of inclusion, diversity, equity, development, opportunity and empowerment. 
Results-Driven, Community-Focused, Collaborative Culture
We focus on creating an environment where our employee-owners, also known as Deluxers, feel respected and valued, and where they can contribute to their full potential. To this end, an important component of our strategy is that all North American employees are granted restricted stock unit awards. The heritage of the company also reflects deep-seated roots in community support and volunteerism, which is reflected in our purpose statement: “Champions for business so communities thrive.” Additionally, our values focus on delivering results:
•Customers First
•Earn Trust
•Innovation
•Grit and Perseverance
•Power of One
In an effort to continue to improve our culture and engagement, we provide learning and development at all levels of the organization on a variety of topics, including, leadership development, mentoring and inclusion, diversity and equity (ID&E). We also strive to drive high engagement and according to the last engagement survey conducted, 78% of employees believe Deluxe is a great place to work. We continue to focus on training and development programs and transparent communication channels through change pulse checks, surveys, senior leadership forums and employee resource groups.
Inclusion, Diversity and Equity
We embrace ID&E in our workforce, customers and partners, valuing their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents. Our mission is to empower all employees to bring their full authentic selves to work and to foster an environment that 
reflects the diverse communities we serve. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. We provide our customers, partners, and shareholders information about our ID&E program and our activities supporting social justice within the communities we serve. In addition, we are focused on furthering our ID&E initiatives throughout our business and have, among other things, created an ID&E council that is sponsored by our Chief Communications and Human Resources Officer and our Chief Revenue Officer. This council is comprised of employee-owners across multiple functions and business segments. Its top priorities include implementing a comprehensive ID&E learning and development plan to build awareness and drive inclusive behaviors; further developing our diversity pipeline through hiring, mentoring and coaching; and establishing goals and metrics to ensure progress.
As of December 31, 2021, our total workforce was approximately 56% female and 44% male. Our team members located in the United States were comprised of approximately 56% white, 16% Black or African American, 11% Hispanic or Latino, 10% Asian American and 7% other. We continue to focus our development and ID&E programs on growing the number of female and minorities represented in leadership roles.
Health, Wellness and Safety
Creating a culture where all employee-owners feel supported and valued is paramount to our strategy. We continue to monitor developments with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its variants, and we continue to take steps to ensure the safety of our employees and business partners. We also continue to provide a competitive benefits package focused on fostering work/life integration. These benefits range from standard medical, dental, life and disability insurance to programs that provide additional support for our employees' mental, physical, financial and social wellbeing. We provide various time-off programs, including volunteer time-off, paid parental leave and paid sabbaticals. These are just a few of the benefits we offer our full- and part-time employees.
Community Engagement 
Our employee-owners believe in the power of connection, of activity and of giving back to the communities we serve. That is why we have created multiple initiatives that focus on supporting our communities, both financially and with time and talent, including providing 3 paid days off to employees each year so that they can volunteer in their communities. We also continue to support the Deluxe Corporation Foundation, which focuses on long-term solutions that help people, businesses and communities thrive and grow, and we have long-term partnerships with United Way®, Junior Achievement USA®, National Urban League, Inc., the National Civil Rights Museum, and other organizations. We continue to deliver on our promise to invest time, talent and financial resources to improve ID&E in the communities we serve, as it is essential to be invested and involved to attract and retain employees of the highest caliber.

SEASONALITY

Historically, we have experienced seasonal trends with some of our products and services. For example, Promotional Solutions holiday card and retail packaging sales and revenues from certain marketing services in Cloud Solutions are typically stronger in the fourth quarter of the year due to the holiday season, while sales of Promotional Solutions tax forms are stronger in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Our customers' marketing campaign cycles may also result in some revenue fluctuations for these segments. Additionally, there is a seasonal aspect to our employee benefit costs, as employees typically do not utilize as much paid time off in the first quarter of the year as they do later in the year, which negatively impacts our margins for the first quarter of the year.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in several areas, including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, merchant processing, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, local, state, national and international governments and health authorities have, at times, established myriad new laws, rules, regulations and orders applicable to us, many of which are required to be implemented within a very short timeframe. The complexity of complying with existing and new laws and regulations is significant, and regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time.
For more specific information about the effects of government regulation on our business, see Item 1A, "Legal and Compliance Risks – Governmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business." We believe that the impact on our capital expenditures and earnings of complying with government regulations will not be materially different in the upcoming year than it was in 2021.
