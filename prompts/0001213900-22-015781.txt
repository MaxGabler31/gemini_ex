ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
General Background of the Company 
 
Trans Global Group, Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in Colorado on April 2, 1979 as Teletek, Inc. On April 9, 1993, the Company effected a merger with a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary (formed March 17, 1993) for the primary purpose of changing its domicile to Delaware.

The Company can currently be defined as a “shell” company, whose sole purpose at this time is to locate and consummate a merger or acquisition with a private entity. The Company will act a holding company, and plans to establish subsidiaries in Hong Kong, and/or the Cayman Islands. Such subsidiaries will then acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business which generates revenues in exchange for its securities. The Company has no particular acquisitions in mind and has not currently entered into any negotiations regarding such an acquisition. The Company’s officer and director has not engaged in any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger between the Company and such other company as of the date hereof.
 
Our major shareholders and headquarters are located in China and we plan to acquire operating assets and businesses in China. We will face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties related to having substantially all of our operations in China. In addition, if any of the assets or businesses that we acquire are on the 2021 Negative List promulgated by the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC (the “MOFCOM”) and the National Development and Reform Commission of China (“NDRC”), we may not be able to conduct our business through such subsidiaries without being subject to restrictions imposed by the foreign investment laws and regulations of the PRC.
 
The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the ability of a China-based company, such as us, to conduct its business, accept foreign investments or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. For example, we face risks associated with regulatory approvals of offshore offerings, anti-monopoly regulatory actions, oversight on cybersecurity and data privacy, as well as the lack of PCAOB inspection on our auditors. Such risks could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our Stocks or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer Stocks and/or other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. See “Risk Factors — Risks Associated with doing business in China.”
 
The PRC government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene with or influence our operations as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals. See “Risk Factors — Risks Associated with doing business in China — Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws, and sudden or unexpected changes in laws and regulations in China could adversely affect us and limit the legal protections available to you and us.” The PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the education and internet industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding the industry of our future PRC subsidiaries that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities and foreign investment in China-based companies like us. Any such action, once taken by the PRC government, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless. See “Risk Factors — Risks Associated with doing business in China — The recent state government interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies may negatively impact our existing and future operations in China; — Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws, and sudden or unexpected changes in laws and regulations in China could adversely affect us and limit the legal protections available to you and us.”
 
We are currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC authorities to and issue our common stock shares to foreign investors. We will determine following acquisition of any subsidiaries whether we or such subsidiaries are required to obtain permission or approval from the PRC authorities including CSRC or Cyberspace Administration of China (the “CAC”) for any acquired operations. As we currently have no such subsidiaries, we have not yet applied for or received any denial for any operations. However, recently, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the “Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law,” or the Opinions, which was made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems will be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-concept overseas listed companies, and cybersecurity and data privacy protection requirements and similar matters. The Opinions and any related implementing rules to be enacted may subject us to compliance requirement in the future. Given the current regulatory environment in the PRC, we are still subject to the uncertainty of interpretation and enforcement of the rules and regulations in the PRC, which can change quickly with little advance notice, and any future actions of the PRC authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies would reach the same conclusion as we do or as advised by our PRC legal counsel. If we are wrong with regards to our interpretation of the PRC laws and regulations, or if the CSRC, the CAC or other regulatory PRC agencies later promulgate new rules requiring that we obtain their approvals to issue our common stock to foreign investors, we may be unable to obtain a waiver of such approval requirements, if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver. Any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding such an approval requirement could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our securities. See “Risk Factors—Risks associated with doing business in China – Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws, and sudden or unexpected changes in laws and regulations in China could adversely affect us and limit the legal protections available to you and us; – The PRC legal system is evolving, and the resulting uncertainties could adversely affect us; – The approval of the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies may be required in connection with this registration under PRC law.”

Business Objectives of the Company 
 
Since April 30, 2021, current management (which includes possible participation by our majority shareholder) has determined to direct its efforts and limited resources to pursue potential new business opportunities. The Company does not intend to limit itself to a particular industry and has not established any particular criteria upon which it shall consider a business opportunity.
 
The Company’s purpose is to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of an issuer who has complied with the Exchange Act. The Company will not restrict its search to any specific business, industry, or geographical location and the Company may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature and we have not established any particular criteria upon which we consider a business opportunity. This discussion of the proposed business herein is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of the Company’s virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities. Management anticipates that it may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because the Company has nominal assets and limited financial resources.
 
Management of the Company, which may also include the majority shareholder of the Company (“Management”) would have substantial flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective new business opportunity. The Company is dependent on the judgment of its management in connection with this process. There are many criteria that management may deem relevant. In connection with an evaluation of a prospective or potential business opportunity, management may be expected to conduct a due diligence review. A business combination may involve a company which may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. In evaluating a prospective business opportunity, we would consider, among other factors, the following:
 

● | costs associated with pursuing a new business opportunity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | the growth potential of the new business opportunity;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | experiences, skills and availability of additional personnel necessary to pursue a potential new business opportunity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | necessary capital requirements;
--+--------------------------------


● | the competitive position of the new business opportunity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | stage of business development;
--+-------------------------------


● | the market acceptance of the potential products and services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | the regulatory environment that may be applicable to any prospective business opportunity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and there may be other criteria that Management may deem relevant. In connection with an evaluation of a prospective or potential business opportunity, Management may be expected to conduct a due diligence review.
 
The time and costs required to pursue new business opportunities, which includes negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable securities laws, can not be ascertained with any degree of certainty.
 
Management intends to devote such time as it deems necessary to carry out the Company’s affairs. The exact length of time required for the pursuit of any new potential business opportunities is uncertain. No assurance can be made that we will be successful in our efforts. We cannot project the amount of time that our Management will devote to the Company’s plan of operation.

Prospective investors in the Company’s common stock will not have an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any of the one or more business combinations that we may undertake. A business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which needs to raise substantial additional capital by means of being a publicly trading company, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, voting control issues and compliance with various federal and state securities laws.
 
The Company intends to conduct its activities to avoid being classified as an “Investment Company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and therefore avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
We voluntarily filed the Registration Statement on Form 10 to make information concerning ourselves more readily available to the public and to become eligible for listing on the OTCQB market sponsored by OTC Markets. Management believes that being a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act will enhance our efforts to acquire or merge with an operating business.
 
As a result of our registration with the SEC, we will be obligated to file interim and periodic reports including an annual report with audited financial statements. This obligation will substantially increase the expenses incurred by the Company.
 
Any company that is merged into or acquired by us will become subject to the same reporting requirements as we. Thus, if we successfully complete an acquisition or merger, the acquired entity must have audited financial statements for at least the two most recent fiscal years, or if the acquired company has been in business for less than two years, audited financial statements must be available from its inception. This requirement limits our possible acquisitions or merger opportunities because many private companies either do not have audited financial statements or are unable to produce audited statements without long delay and substantial expense.
 
The Company’s common stock is subject to quotation on the OTC Markets Group, Inc. Pink Open Market Platform (“Pink Sheets”) under the symbol TGGI. There is currently only a limited trading market in the Company’s shares, nor do we believe that any active trading market has existed for approximately the last five years. There can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for our securities following the effective date of this Registration Statement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). In the event that an active trading market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price of our shares of common stock, whether the trading market will provide liquidity to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained.

General Overview 
 
Competition. 
 
In identifying, evaluating, and selecting a target business, we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. The Company will remain an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and equity financial concerns which have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than the Company. In view of the Company’s combined extremely limited financial resources and limited management availability, the Company will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to the Company’s competitors. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations, either directly or through affiliates. Many if not virtually most of these competitors possess far greater financial, human, and other resources compared to our resources. While we believe that there are numerous potential target businesses that we may identify, our ability to compete in acquiring certain of the more desirable target businesses will be limited by our limited financial and human resources. Our inherent competitive limitations are expected by management to give others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business that we may identify and seek to pursue. Further, any of these limitations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Management believes that our status as a reporting public entity with potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over certain privately held entities having a similar business objective in acquiring a desirable target business with growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from existing competitors of the business we acquire. In particular, certain industries which experience rapid growth frequently attract an increasingly larger number of competitors, including those with far greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources than the initial competitors in the industry in which we seek to operate. The degree of competition characterizing the industry of any prospective target business cannot presently be ascertained. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources to compete effectively, especially to the extent that the target business is in a high-growth industry.
 
Employees
 
As of March 1, 2022, we employed a total of 0 full-time employees and 1 consultant. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the decision whether or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities.
Conflicts of Interest. 
 
The Company’s management is not required to commit its full time to the Company’s affairs. As a result, pursuing new business opportunities may require a longer period of time than if management would devote full time to the Company’s affairs. Management is not precluded from serving as an officer or director of any other entity that is engaged in business activities similar to those of the Company. Management has not identified and is not currently negotiating a new business opportunity for us. In the future, management may become associated or affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those we intend to conduct. In such event, management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. In the event that the Company’s management has multiple business affiliations, our management may have legal obligations to present certain business opportunities to multiple entities. In the event that a conflict of interest shall arise, management will consider factors such as reporting status, availability of audited financial statements, current capitalization, and the laws of jurisdictions. If several business opportunities or operating entities approach management with respect to a business combination, management will consider the foregoing factors as well as the preferences of the management of the operating company. However, management will act in what we believe will be in the best interests of the shareholders of the Company. The Company shall not enter into a transaction with a target business that is affiliated with management.

Challenges with Having Operations in China
 
Trans Global Group, Inc. is a Delaware holding company that plans to conduct substantially all of its operations and business in China through PRC based subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to pay dividends and to service any debt we may incur overseas largely depends upon dividends paid PRC subsidiaries to us. If any PRC subsidiary incurs debt on its own behalf, the instruments governing its debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends to us. In addition, a PRC subsidiary is permitted to pay dividends to us only out of its retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprise as promulgated by the Ministry of Finance of the PRC, or the PRC GAAP.
 
Such structure involves unique risks to investors in our common stock. For a detailed description of the risk, see “Risk Factors”, including the risks described under the subsections headed “Risks Related to Our Business and Industry”, “Risks associated with doing business in China” and “Risks Related to the Market for our stock”. In particular, as we are to be a China-based company incorporated in Delaware, we face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties related to being based in and having substantially all of our operations in China. The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the ability of a China-based company, such as us, to conduct its business, accept foreign investments or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. For example, we face risks associated with regulatory approvals of offshore offerings, anti-monopoly regulatory actions, oversight on cybersecurity and data privacy, as well as the lack of PCAOB inspection on our auditors. Such risks could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our Stocks or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer Stocks and/or other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. The PRC government also has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and our operations may be affected by evolving regulatory policies as a result. The PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding our industry that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities and foreign investment in China-based companies like us. These risks could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our common stocks, or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. You should pay special attention to the subsection headed “Risks associated with doing business in China” below.
 
Recent Regulatory Developments
 
Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing 
 
On December 24, 2021, the CSRC issued the Administrative Provisions of the State Council Regarding the Overseas Issuance and Listing of Securities by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments) (the “Draft Administrative Provisions”) and the Measures for the Overseas Issuance of Securities and Listing Record-Filings by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments) (the “Draft Filing Measures”, collectively with the Draft Administrative Provisions, the “Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing”), both of which are subject to public comments and have not taken effect yet. The Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing lay out the filing regulation arrangement for both direct and indirect overseas listing, and clarify the determination criteria for indirect overseas listing in overseas markets.
 

The Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing stipulate that the Chinese-based companies, or the issuer, shall fulfill the filing procedures within three working days after the issuer makes an application for initial public offering and listing in a foreign exchange. The required filing materials for an initial public offering and listing shall include but not limited to: record-filing report and related undertakings; regulatory opinions, record-filing, approval and other documents issued by competent regulatory authorities of relevant industries (if applicable); and security assessment opinion issued by relevant regulatory authorities (if applicable); PRC legal opinion; and prospectus. In addition, an issuer who issues overseas listed securities after initial public offering shall, within three working days after the completion of the issuance, submit required filing materials to the CSRC, including but not limited to: filing report and relevant commitment; and domestic legal opinion. Furthermore, an overseas offering and listing is prohibited under any of the following circumstances: (1) if the intended securities offering and listing is specifically prohibited by national laws and regulations and relevant provisions; (2) if the intended securities offering and listing may constitute a threat to or endangers national security as reviewed and determined by competent authorities under the State Council in accordance with law; (3) if there are material ownership disputes over the equity, major assets, and core technology, etc. of the issuer; (4) if, in the past three years, the domestic enterprise or its controlling shareholders or actual controllers have committed corruption, bribery, embezzlement, misappropriation of property, or other criminal offenses disruptive to the order of the socialist market economy, or are currently under judicial investigation for suspicion of criminal offenses, or are under investigation for suspicion of major violations; (5) if, in past three years, directors, supervisors, or senior executives have been subject to administrative punishments for severe violations, or are currently under judicial investigation for suspicion of criminal offenses, or are under investigation for suspicion of major violations; (6) other circumstances as prescribed by the State Council. The Draft Administration Provisions defines the legal liabilities of breaches such as failure in fulfilling filing obligations or fraudulent filing conducts, imposing a fine between RMB 1 million and RMB 10 million, and in cases of severe violations, a parallel order to suspend relevant business or halt operation for rectification, revoke relevant business permits or operational license.

At of the date of this Registration Statement, the Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listings have not been promulgated, and we have not been required to obtain permission or filing from the PRC government authorities for any of our offerings. However, there is uncertainty in connection with whether we are required to obtain permissions or filing from the PRC government authorities with respect of our operations and/or offering once we have acquired our target PRC subsidiaries. In the event that the Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing take effect, we or any of our subsidiaries may be subject to the filing and compliance requirements, we cannot assure you that any of us will be able to receive clearance of such filing requirements in a timely manner, or at all. Any failure of us to fully comply with new regulatory requirements may significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer our securities, cause significant disruption to our business operations, severely damage our reputation, materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause our securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless. See “Risk Factors—The approval of the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies may be required under PRC law.”
 
Measures to Expanding Efforts in Anti-Monopoly Enforcement
 
The PRC Anti-Monopoly enforcement agencies have in recent years strengthened enforcement under the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law. In March 2018, the State Administration for Market Regulation (the “SAMR”), was formed as a new governmental agency to take over, among other things, the Anti-Monopoly enforcement functions from the relevant departments under the MOFCOM, the National Development Reform Committee (“NDRC”) and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (the “SAIC”), respectively. Since its inception, the SAMR has continued to strengthen Anti-Monopoly enforcement. In December 2018, the SAMR issued the Notice on Anti-Monopoly Enforcement Authorization, which grants authorities to its province-level branches to conduct Anti-Monopoly enforcement within their respective jurisdictions. In September 2020, the SAMR issued Anti-Monopoly Compliance Guideline for Operators, which requires, under the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law, operators to establish Anti-Monopoly compliance management systems to prevent Anti-Monopoly compliance risks. On February 7, 2021, the Anti-Monopoly Commission of the State Council officially promulgated the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Internet Platforms. Pursuant to an official interpretation from the Anti-Monopoly Commission of the State Council, the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Internet Platforms mainly covers five aspects, including general provisions, monopoly agreements, abusing market dominance, concentration of undertakings, and abusing of administrative powers eliminating or restricting competition. On October 23, 2021, the SAMR released a draft amendment of Anti-Monopoly Law (the “AML”) for public comments for the first time since the 2008 AML came into effect. This is the second round of published draft amendments to the AML, which followed the previous set open for public consultation by the SAMR in January 2020. The draft amendments to the AML set out new substantive rules including safe harbor for monopoly agreements, introduced “stop-the-clock” mechanism and enhanced personal liability and monetary penalties for substantive violations.
 
As the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Internet Platforms and the amendments to the AML are newly published, we are unable to estimate its specific impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and future acquisition of PRC subsidiaries. We cannot assure you that our business operations will comply with such regulations and authorities’ requirements in all respects. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply such regulations and authorities’ requirements may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, lawsuits or claims against us and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations upon our future acquisition of PRC subsidiaries.
 
Cybersecurity Measures and Draft Regulation Regarding Cyber Data Security
 
On December 28, 2021, the CAC, published the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021), which will come into effect on February 15, 2022 and replace the current Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2020). The Measures for Cyber Security Review specifies that the procurement of network products and services by operator of critical information infrastructure and the activities of data process carried out by Internet platform operator that raise or may raise “national security” concerns are subject to strict cyber security review by Office of Cyber Security Review established by the CAC. Before critical information infrastructure operator purchases internet products and services, it should assess the potential risk of national security that may be caused by the use of such products and services. If such use of products and services may give raise to national security concerns, it should apply for a cyber security review by the Cyber Security Review Office and a report of analysis of the potential effect on national security shall be submitted when the application is made. In addition, Internet platform operators that possess the personal data of over one million users must apply for a review by the Cyber Security Review Office, if they plan listing of companies in foreign countries. The CAC may voluntarily conduct cyber security review if any network products and services and activities of data process affects or may affect national security. It may take approximately 70 business days in maximum for the general cybersecurity review upon the delivery of their applications, which may be subject to extensions for a special review.

In addition, on November 14, 2021, the Administration Regulations on Cyber Data Security (Draft for Comments) (《网络数据安全管理条例（征求意见稿）》 ) (the “Draft Regulation”) was proposed by the CAC for public comments until December 13, 2021. The Draft Regulation stipulates that data processors which process the personal information of at least one million users must apply for a cybersecurity review if they plan listing of companies in foreign countries, and the Draft Regulation further requires the data processors that carry out the following activities to apply for cybersecurity review in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations: (i) the merger, reorganization or division of internet platform operators that have gathered a large number of data resources related to national security, economic development and public interests affects or may affect national security; (ii) the listing of the data processor in Hong Kong affects or may affect the national security; and (iii) other data processing activities that affect or may affect national security. Any failure to comply with such requirements may subject us to, among others, suspension of services, fines, revoking relevant business permits or business licenses and penalties. As advised by our PRC legal counsel, since the CAC is still seeking comments on the Draft Regulation from the public as of the date of the Annual Report, the Draft Regulation (especially its operative provisions) and its anticipated adoption or effective date are subject to further changes with substantial uncertainty.
 
As the Measures for Cyber Security Review and the Draft Regulation are newly published, the exact scope of “critical information infrastructure operators” and “data processing operators” under the draft measures and the current regulatory regime remains unclear, and the PRC government authorities may have wide discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these laws. Currently, the Measures for Cyber Security Review and the Draft Regulation have not materially affected our business and operations, but in anticipation of the strengthened implementation of cybersecurity laws and regulations and the continued expansion of our business, our future PRC subsidiary faces potential risks if we are deemed as a critical information infrastructure operator or data processing operator under the PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations. In such case, we must fulfill certain obligations as required under the PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations, including, among others, storing personal information and other important data collected and produced within the PRC territory as part of our operations in China (as we currently do in our operations), and we may be subject to lengthy cybersecurity review and other enhanced regulatory requirements when purchasing internet products and services or conducting data processing activities. We may face challenges in addressing such enhanced regulatory requirements and make necessary changes to our internal policies and practices in data privacy and cybersecurity matters. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We may be liable for improper collection, use or appropriation of personal information provided by our customers.”
 
As of the date of this filing of the Annual Report, we have no operating subsidiaries involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by the CAC based on the draft measures, and we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, sanctions in such respect or any regulatory objections to this registration. As of the date of this registration statement, recent regulatory actions by China’s government related to data security or anti-monopoly have not materially impacted our ability to conduct our business, accept foreign investments or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchanges. Based on existing PRC laws and regulations, as advised by our PRC legal counsel, neither we nor our subsidiaries are currently subject to any pre-approval requirement from the CAC to operate our business or conduct this registration, subject to PRC government’s interpretation and implementation of the Measures for Cyber Security Review and the Draft Regulation after it takes effect. However, we cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies, including the CAC, would reach the same conclusion as we do or as advised by our PRC legal counsel.

Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Guidance Catalog, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, and the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC. The Guidance Catalog lays out the basic framework for foreign investment in China, classifying businesses into three categories with regard to foreign investment: “encouraged,” “restricted” and “prohibited”. Industries not listed in the catalog are generally deemed as falling into a fourth category “permitted” unless specifically restricted by other PRC laws.
 
In addition, in June 2018 the MOFCOM and the NDRC promulgated the Special Management Measures (Negative List) for the Access of Foreign Investment, or the Negative List, which became effective on July 28, 2018 and was further updated on June 30, 2019, June 23, 2020 and January 1, 2022.

Foreign Investment Law
 
On March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, or the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law of the PRC, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The organization form, organization and activities of foreign-invested enterprises shall be governed, among others, by the PRC Company Law and the PRC Partnership Enterprise Law. Foreign-invested enterprises established before the implementation of the Foreign Investment Law may retain the original business organization and so on within five years after the implementation of this Law.
 
The Foreign Investment Law is formulated to further expand opening-up, vigorously promote foreign investment and protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors. According to the Foreign Investment Law, foreign investments are entitled to pre-entry national treatment and are subject to negative list management system. The pre-entry national treatment means that the treatment given to foreign investors and their investments at the stage of investment access shall not be less favorable than that of domestic investors and their investments. The negative list management system means that the state implements special administrative measures for access of foreign investment in specific fields.
 
Foreign investors’ investment, earnings and other legitimate rights and interests within the territory of China shall be protected in accordance with the law, and all national policies on supporting the development of enterprises shall equally apply to foreign-invested enterprises. Among others, the state guarantees that foreign-invested enterprises participate in the formulation of standards in an equal manner and that foreign-invested enterprises participate in government procurement activities through fair competition in accordance with the law. Further, the state shall not expropriate any foreign investment except under special circumstances. In special circumstances, the state may levy or expropriate the investment of foreign investors in accordance with the law for the needs of the public interest. The expropriation and requisition shall be conducted in accordance with legal procedures and timely and reasonable compensation shall be given. In carrying out business activities, foreign-invested enterprises shall comply with relevant provisions on labor protection.
 
The Implementation Regulations of Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, adopted by the State Council on December 26, 2019 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides implementing measures and detailed rules to ensure the effective implementation of the Foreign Investment Law.

On July 16, 2013, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, issued the Provisions on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunication and Internet User, which was effective as of September 1, 2013. The requirements under this order are stricter and wider compared to the above decision issued by the National People’s Congress. According to the provisions, if a network service provider wishes to collect or use personal information, it may do so only if such collection is necessary for the services it provides. Furthermore, it must disclose to its users the purpose, method and scope of any such collection or usage, and must obtain consent from the users whose information is being collected or used. Network service providers are also required to establish and publish their protocols relating to personal information collection or usage, keep any collected information strictly confidential and take technological and other measures to maintain the security of such information. Network service providers are required to cease any collection or usage of the relevant personal information and provide services for the users to de-register the relevant user account, when a user stops using the relevant Internet service. Network service providers are further prohibited from divulging, distorting or destroying any such personal information, or selling or providing such personal information unlawfully to other parties. In addition, if a network service provider appoints an agent to undertake any marketing or technical services that involve the collection or usage of personal information, the network service provider is required to supervise and manage the protection of the information. The provisions state, in broad terms, that violators may face warnings, fines, public exposure and, criminal liability whereas the case constitutes a crime.

The PRC Data Security Law also provides for a national security review procedure for data activities that may affect national security and imposes export restrictions on certain data and information. As uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and implementation of these laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will comply with such regulations in all respects and we may be ordered to rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory authorities. We may also become subject to fines and/or other sanctions which may have material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.
 
On August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China promulgated the PRC Personal Information Protection Law (《中华人民共和国个人信息保护法》), or the PIPL, which will take effect in November 2021.

Trademark
 
Trademarks are protected by the Trademark Law of the PRC, which was adopted in 1982 and subsequently amended in 1993, 2001, 2013 and 2019 as well as by the Implementation Regulations of the PRC Trademark Law adopted by the State Council in 1983 and as most recently amended on April 29, 2014.

Domain name
 
The domain names are protected under the Administrative Measures on the Internet Domain Names, or the Domain Name Measures, which was promulgated by the MIIT and became effective in November 2017. The MIIT is the major regulatory body responsible for the administration of the PRC internet domain names, under supervision of which China Internet Network Information Center, or the CNNIC, is responsible for the daily administration of CN domain names and PRC domain names.

Regulations Related to Foreign Exchange 
 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, promulgated by the State Council in 1996 and most recently amended in 2008. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from State Administration of Foreign Exchange or SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate governmental authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans.
 
In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 59, which was most recently amended in 2015 and substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedures. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 59, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts, and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of Renminbi proceeds derived by foreign investors in China, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously.
 
In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving the Administration of the Foreign Exchange Concerning Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 13, pursuant to which, instead of applying for approval regarding foreign exchange registrations of foreign direct investment and overseas direct investment from SAFE, entities and individuals may apply for such foreign exchange registrations from qualified banks. The qualified banks, under the supervision of SAFE, may directly review the applications and conduct the registration.
 
In March 2015, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 19, a foreign-invested enterprise may, according to its actual business needs, settle with a bank the portion of the foreign exchange capital in its capital account for which the relevant foreign exchange administration has confirmed monetary capital contribution rights and interests (or for which the bank has registered the injection of the monetary capital contribution into the account). In addition, for the time being, foreign-invested enterprises are allowed to settle 100% of their foreign exchange capital on a discretionary basis. A foreign-invested enterprise shall truthfully use its capital for its own operational purposes within the scope of business. Where an ordinary foreign-invested enterprise makes domestic equity investment with the amount of foreign exchanges settled, the invested enterprise must first go through domestic re-investment registration and open a corresponding account for foreign exchange settlement pending payment with the foreign exchange administration or the bank at the place where it is registered.
 
In June 2016, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts, or SAFE Circular 16, pursuant to which, in addition to foreign currency capital, enterprises registered in China may also convert their foreign debts, as well as repatriated fund raised through overseas listing, from foreign currency to Renminbi on a discretional basis. SAFE Circular 16 also reiterates that the use of capital so converted shall follow “the principle of authenticity and self-use” within the business scope of the enterprise. According to SAFE Circular 16, the Renminbi funds so converted shall not be used for the purposes of, whether directly or indirectly, (i) paying expenditures beyond the business scope of the enterprises or prohibited by laws and regulations; (ii) making securities investment or other investments (except for banks’ principal-secured products); (iii) granting loans to non-affiliated enterprises, except as expressly permitted in the business license; and (iv) purchasing non-self-used real estate (except for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises).

In January 2017, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Improving Reform of Foreign Exchange Administration and Optimizing Genuineness and Compliance Verification, or SAFE Circular 3, which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to the outbound remittance of profit from domestic entities to offshore entities, including (i) under the principle of genuine transaction, banks shall check board resolutions regarding profit distribution, the original version of tax filing records, and audited financial statements; and (ii) domestic entities shall hold income to account for previous years’ losses before remitting the profits. Further, pursuant to SAFE Circular 3, domestic entities shall make detailed explanations of the sources of capital and utilization arrangements, and provide board resolutions, contracts and other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment.
 
On October 23, 2019, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Facilitation of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or SAFE Circular 28, which allows non-investment foreign-invested enterprises to make domestic equity investment with their capital funds in accordance with the law under the premise that such investment does not violate the existing special administrative measures (negative list) for foreign investment and the project invested in China is authentic and compliant. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 28, upon receiving the payment of consideration from a foreign investor for the equity transfer under foreign direct investment, the domestic transferor, with relevant registration certificates, can process the formalities for account opening, fund receipt, and foreign exchange settlement and use directly at the bank. The foreign investor’s deposit remitted from overseas or transferred from domestic accounts can be directly used for its lawful domestic capital contribution as well as domestic and overseas payment after the transaction is concluded.
 
On April 10, 2020, SAFE issued the Circular on Optimizing Administration of Foreign Exchange to Support the Development of Foreign-related Business, or SAFE Circular 8, pursuant to which, eligible enterprises are allowed to use the income under capital account, from such sources as capital funds, foreign debt and overseas listing, for domestic payment without having to provide supporting authentication materials to the banks for every transaction in advance, but the use of funds shall be true and compliant as well as conform to the existing administration regulations regarding use of income under capital account. The concerned bank shall conduct spot checking in accordance with the relevant requirements.
 
Regulations Related to Dividend Distribution
 
The principal regulations governing the distribution of dividends paid by WFOEs include the Company Law of PRC, which applies to both PRC domestic companies and foreign-invested companies, and the Foreign Investment Law and its implementing rules, which apply to foreign-invested companies. Under these regulations, WFOEs in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a WFOE in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until its cumulative total reserve funds reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserve funds, however, may not be distributed as cash dividends.
Regulations Related to Foreign Exchange Registration of Offshore Investment by PRC Residents
 
In July 2014, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Issues concerning Foreign Exchange Administration over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Round-trip Investment by Domestic Residents via Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37 which was most recently amended on June 15, 2018 and has replaced the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Residents’ Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles (known as Circular 75). SAFE Circular 37 regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of special purpose vehicles, or “SPVs,” by PRC residents or entities to seek offshore investment and financing or conduct round trip investment in China. Under SAFE Circular 37, an SPV refers to an offshore entity established or controlled, directly or indirectly, by PRC residents or entities for the purpose of seeking offshore financing or making offshore investment, using legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests, while “round trip investment” refers to the direct investment in China by PRC residents or entities through SPVs, namely, establishing foreign-invested enterprises to obtain the ownership, control rights and management rights. Circular 37 requires that, before making contribution into an SPV, PRC residents or entities are required to complete foreign exchange registration with SAFE or its local branch.
 
In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the SAFE Circular 13. SAFE Circular 13 has amended SAFE Circular 37 by requiring PRC residents or entities to register with qualified banks instead of SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment of an SPV.

In addition, pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, an amendment to registration or subsequent filing with qualified banks by such PRC resident is also required if there is a material change with respect to the capital of the offshore company, such as any change of basic information (including change of such PRC residents, change of name and operation term of the SPV), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions. Failure to comply with the registration requirements as set forth in SAFE Circular 37 and SAFE Circular 13, misrepresent on or failure to disclose controllers of foreign-invested enterprises that are established by round-trip investment may result in bans on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliates, and may also subject relevant PRC residents to penalties under the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations of the PRC.
 
Regulations Related to Foreign Debt
 
As an offshore holding company, we may make additional capital contributions to PRC subsidiary subject to approval from the local department of commerce and the SAFE, with no limitation on the amount of capital contributions. We may also make loans to any PRC subsidiary subject to the approval from SAFE or its local office and the limitation on the amount of loans.
 
By means of making loans, we are subject to the relevant PRC laws and regulation relating to foreign debts. On January 8, 2003, the State Development Planning Commission, SAFE, and Ministry of Finance, or MOF, jointly promulgated the Circular on the Interim Provisions on the Management of Foreign Debts, or the Foreign Debts Provisions, which became effective on March 1, 2003, and was partially abolished on May 10, 2015. Pursuant to Foreign Debts Provisions, the total amount of foreign loans received by a foreign-invested company shall not exceed the difference between the total investment in projects as approved by the MOFCOM or its local counterpart and the amount of registered capital of such foreign-invested company. In addition, on January 12, 2017, the People’s Bank of China, or PBOC, issued the Circular on Full-Coverage Macro-Prudent Management of Cross-Border Financing, or the PBOC Circular 9, which sets out the statutory upper limit on the foreign debts for PRC non-financial entities, including both foreign-invested companies and domestic-invested companies, and the macro-prudential adjustment parameter is 1. Pursuant to the PBOC Circular 9, the foreign debt upper limit for both foreign-invested companies and domestic-invested companies is calculated as twice the net asset of such companies. As to net assets, the companies shall take the net assets value stated in their latest audited financial statement. On March 11, 2020, the PBOC and SAFE promulgated the Circular of the People’s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Adjusting the Macro-prudential Regulation Parameter for Full-covered Cross-border Financing, which provides that based on the current macro economy and international balance of payments, the macro-prudential regulation parameter as set forth in the PBOC Circular 9 is updated from 1 to 1.25.
 
The PBOC Circular 9 does not supersede the Foreign Debts Provisions. It provides a one-year transitional period from January 11, 2017, for foreign-invested companies, during which foreign-invested companies, such as our PRC subsidiary, could adopt their calculation method of foreign debt upper limit based on either the Foreign Debts Provisions or the PBOC Circular 9. The transitional period ended on January 11, 2018. Upon its expiry, pursuant to the PBOC Circular 9, PBOC and SAFE shall reevaluate the calculation method for foreign-invested companies and determine what the applicable calculation method would be. As of the date of this Registration Statement, neither the PBOC nor SAFE has promulgated and made public any further rules, regulations, notices, or circulars in this regard.
 
Regulations Related to Tax
 
Enterprise Income Tax
 
On March 16, 2007, the SCNPC promulgated the EIT Law, which was recently amended on December 29, 2018. On December 6, 2007, the State Council enacted the Regulations for the Implementation of the Enterprise Income Tax Law, which was amended on April 23, 2019. Under the EIT Law and relevant implementation regulations, both resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises are subject to the enterprise income tax so long as their income is generated within the territory of PRC. “Resident enterprises” are defined as enterprises that are established in China in accordance with PRC laws, or that are established in accordance with the laws of foreign countries but are actually or in effect controlled from within the PRC. “Non-resident enterprises” are defined as enterprises that are organized under the laws of foreign countries and whose actual management is conducted outside the PRC, but have established institutions or premises in the PRC, or have no such established institutions or premises but have income generated from inside the PRC. Under the EIT Law and relevant implementing regulations, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 25% is applied. If non-resident enterprises have not formed permanent establishments or premises in the PRC, or if they have formed permanent establishment or premises in the PRC but there is no actual relationship between the relevant income derived in the PRC and the established institutions or premises set up by them, however, enterprise income tax is set at the rate of 10% with respect to their income sourced from inside the PRC.
 
The EIT Law and its implementation rules permit certain “high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the state” that independently own core intellectual property and meet statutory criteria, to enjoy a reduced 15% enterprise income tax rate.
 
According to the Administrative Rules for the Certification of High-Tech Enterprises, effective on January 1, 2008 and amended on January 29, 2016 (effective as of January 1, 2016), for each entity accredited as High Tech Enterprise, such status is valid for three years if it meets the qualifications for High Tech Enterprise on a continuing basis during such period.

Value-Added Tax (“VAT”)
 
The Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax was promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, and most recently amended on November 19, 2017. The Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax (Revised in 2011) were promulgated by the MOF on December 25, 1993 and were recently amended on October 28, 2011 (collectively with the VAT Regulations, the VAT Law). On April 4, 2018, MOF and SAT jointly promulgated the Circular on Adjustment of Value-Added Tax Rates, or MOF and SAT Circular 32. On March 20, 2019, MOF, SAT and General Administration of Customs, or GAC, jointly issued a Circular on Relevant Polices for Deepening Value-added Tax Reform, or MOF, SAT and GAC Circular 39, which became effective from April 1, 2019. According to the abovementioned laws and circulars, all enterprises and individuals engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of processing, repair and replacement services, sales of services, intangible assets, real property and the importation of goods within the territory of the PRC are the taxpayers of VAT. The VAT tax rates generally applicable are simplified as 13%, 9%, 6% and 0%, and the VAT tax rate applicable to the small-scale taxpayers is 3%.
 
Withholding Tax
 
The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC provides that since January 1, 2008, an income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to dividends declared to non-PRC resident investors which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC.
 
Pursuant to an Arrangement Between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Incomes, or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, and other applicable PRC laws, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied the relevant conditions and requirements under such Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement and other applicable laws, the 10% withholding tax on the dividends the Hong Kong resident enterprise receives from a PRC resident enterprise may be reduced to 5%. Based on the Circular on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties, or the SAT Circular 81, issued on February 20, 2009, by the SAT, however, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment. According to the Circular on Several Questions regarding the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties, which was issued on February 3, 2018, by the SAT and took effect on April 1, 2018, when determining the applicant’s status of the “beneficial owner” regarding tax treatments in connection with dividends, interests or royalties in the tax treaties, several factors, including without limitation, whether the applicant is obligated to pay more than 50% of his or her income in 12 months to residents in third country or region, whether the business operated by the applicant constitutes the actual business activities, and whether the counterparty country or region to the tax treaties does not levy any tax or grant tax exemption on relevant incomes or levy tax at an extremely low rate, will be taken into account, and it will be analyzed according to the actual circumstances of the specific cases. This circular further provides that applicants who intend to prove his or her status of the “beneficial owner” shall submit the relevant documents to the relevant tax bureau according to the Announcement on Issuing the Measures for the Administration of Non-Resident Taxpayers’ Enjoyment of the Treatment under Tax Agreements.
 
Tax on Indirect Transfer
 
On February 3, 2015, the SAT issued the Circular on Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Transfers of Assets by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 7. Pursuant to SAT Circular 7, an “indirect transfer” of assets, including equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises, may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise income tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax. When determining whether there is a “reasonable commercial purpose” of the transaction arrangement, features to be taken into consideration include, inter alia, whether the main value of the equity interest of the relevant offshore enterprise derives directly or indirectly from PRC taxable assets; whether the assets of the relevant offshore enterprise mainly consist of direct or indirect investment in China or if its income is mainly derived from China; and whether the offshore enterprise and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding PRC taxable assets have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their actual function and risk exposure. According to SAT Circular 7, where the transferee fails to withhold any or sufficient tax, the transferor shall declare and pay such tax to the tax authority by itself within the statutory time limit. Late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default interest. SAT Circular 7 does not apply to transactions of sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange where such shares were acquired on a public stock exchange. On October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the Circular on Issues of Tax Withholding regarding Non-PRC Resident Enterprise Income Tax, or SAT Circular 37, which further elaborates the relevant implemental rules regarding the calculation, reporting and payment obligations of the withholding tax by the non-resident enterprises. Nonetheless, there remain uncertainties as to the interpretation and application of SAT Circular 7. SAT Circular 7 may be determined by the tax authorities to be applicable to our offshore transactions or sale of our shares or those of our offshore subsidiaries where non-resident enterprises, being the transferors, were involved.
