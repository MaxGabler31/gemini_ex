Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. is organized under the laws of British Columbia, Canada. In this Annual Report, the “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. and its subsidiaries.
 
The Company’s operations are classified into three reportable operating segments, one discontinued segment (Industrial Tools) and the parent corporate and administrative segment, which were determined based on the nature of the products offered along with the markets being served. The segments are as follows:

· | Seed processing and sales
--+--------------------------

--+-----------------------------

 
Effective September 1, 2013, the Company reorganized certain of its subsidiaries. Jewett-Cameron Lumber Corporation (“JCLC”) was changed to JC USA Inc. (“JC USA”), which has the following three wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
The industrial wood products segment reflects the business conducted by Greenwood Products, Inc. (“Greenwood”). Greenwood is a processor and distributor of industrial wood products. A major product category is treated plywood that is sold to the transportation industry.
 
The pet, fencing and other segments reflect the business of the Jewett-Cameron Company (“JCC”). JCC is a wholesaler of products based in these categories.

Fencing and containment products include such products as proprietary gate and fencing components, including trademarked and patented post systems, wood and other fencing infill products, as well as kitted security fencing solutions. Other products include garden, landscaping and miscellaneous products for the home. JCC uses contract manufacturers to make all products. Some of the products that JCC distributes flow through the Company’s distribution center located in North Plains, Oregon, and some are shipped direct to the customer from the manufacturer. Primary customers are home centers, eCommerce providers, other retailers, and direct sales to consumers.
 
The seed processing and sales segment reflects the business of Jewett-Cameron Seed Company (“JCSC”). JCSC processes and distributes agricultural seed. Most of this segment’s sales come from selling seed to distributors with a lesser amount of sales derived from cleaning seed.

General Development of Business
 
Incorporation and Subsidiaries
 
Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. was incorporated under the Company Act of British Columbia on July 8, 1987 as a holding company for Jewett-Cameron Lumber Corporation (“JCLC”), which was incorporated in September 1953 in Oregon, USA. Jewett-Cameron Trading Company, Ltd. acquired all the shares of JCLC through a stock-for-stock exchange on July 13, 1987, and at that time JCLC became a wholly owned subsidiary. Effective September 1, 2013, the Company completed a reorganization of certain of its subsidiaries and JCLC’s name was changed to JC USA Inc. (“JC USA”). JC USA has the following wholly owned subsidiaries. MSI-PRO Co. (“MSI”), incorporated in April 1996 and dissolved in September 2019, Jewett-Cameron Seed Company, (“JCSC”), incorporated in October 2000, Greenwood Products, Inc. (“Greenwood”), incorporated in February 2002, and Jewett-Cameron Company (“JCC”) incorporated in September 2013. Jewett-Cameron Trading Company, Ltd. and its subsidiaries have no significant assets in Canada.
Corporate Development
 
Incorporated in 1953, JC USA operated as a small lumber wholesaler based in Portland, Oregon. In September 1984, the original stockholders sold their interest in the corporation to a new group of investors. Two members of that group remained active in the Company. These individuals are Donald Boone, who passed away in May, 2019, and who was the previous Chairman and Director and the former President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer, and Principal Financial Officer, transitioning to strictly the Board Chair in 2017; and Michael Nasser, who remains active in the business and is both a Director and the Corporate Secretary.
 
In July 1987, the Company acquired JC USA in what was not an arms-length transaction.

In early 1986, prior to JC USA being acquired by the Company, JC USA acquired Material Supply International (“Material Supply”). Material Supply was engaged in the importation and distribution of pneumatic air tools and industrial clamps. The product line was re-branded as “MSI-PRO” and MSI was incorporated in 1996 to carry-on the business of Material Supply.
 
In October 2000, JCSC was incorporated in anticipation of JC USA acquiring the business and certain assets of a firm called Agrobiotech Inc. JCSC operates as a seed storage, processing and sales business.
 
In February 2002, Greenwood was incorporated in anticipation of JC USA acquiring the business and certain assets of Greenwood Forest Products Inc. Greenwood is involved in the processing and distribution of specialty wood products.
 
In June 2012, the Company acquired land and fixed assets located in Manning, Oregon for $250,000 cash. The property was sold in an arms-length transaction in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 for $325,000 cash.
 
In May 2019 Chairman and Co-Founder of the Company Donald M. Boone passed away. Mr. Boone served as President and CEO from 1984 until 2017 when he voluntarily retired from his officer positions and oversaw the addition and successful integration of new management and directors.
 
In September 2019 the Board of Directors decided to permanently close the Company’s MSI-Pro division. Efforts to drive further sales and margin growth were unsuccessful due to a lack of market differentiation and changing customer patterns. The remaining inventory was liquidated and the personnel were moved into different positions with the Company. As of August 31, 2020, MSI was wound-up and the division closed.
 
Narrative Description of Business
 
The Company’s operations are classified into four segments: Industrial wood products; Pet, Fencing and Other; Seed processing and sales; and corporate and administration. Sales, income before taxes, assets, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, and interest expense by segment are shown in the financial statements under Note 12 “Segment Information”.
 
Pet, Fencing and Other – JCC 
 
The pet, fencing and other segments reflect the business of Jewett-Cameron Company (JCC), which is a manufacturer and distributor of specialty products and a wholesaler of products formerly conducted by JCLC.
 
JCC operates out of a 5.6 acre owned facility located in North Plains, Oregon that includes offices, a warehouse, and a paved yard. This business is a wholesaler, and a manufacturer and distributor of products that include an array of pet enclosures, kennels, and pet welfare and comfort products, proprietary gate support systems, perimeter fencing, greenhouses, and fencing in-fill products made of wood, metal and composites. Examples of the Company’s brands include Lucky Dog®, for pet products; Adjust-A-Gate™, Fit-Right®, Perimeter Patrol®, and Lifetime Post™ for gates and fencing; Early Start, Spring Gardner™, Greenline®, and Weatherguard for greenhouses. JCC uses contract manufacturers to manufacture these products. Some of the products that JCC distributes flow through the Company’s facility in North Plains, Oregon, and some are shipped direct to the customer from the manufacturer. Primary customers are home centers, eCommerce partners, on-line direct consumers as well as other retailers.
 
The home improvement business is seasonal, with higher levels of sales occurring between February and August. Inventory buildup occurs until the start of the season in February and then gradually declines to seasonal low levels at the end of the summer.
 
JCC has concentrated on building a customer base for lawn, garden, and pet related products. Management believes this market is less sensitive to downturns in the U.S. economy than is the market for new home construction as its products serve both new and existing home and pet owners.
 
The wood products that JCC distributes are not unique and are available from multiple suppliers. However, the metal products that JCC manufactures and distributes may be somewhat differentiated from similar products available from other suppliers. The company has been successful garnering key patents and trademarks on multiple products that assist their ability to continue to differentiate based on design and functionality.

JCC owns the patents and manufacturing rights connected with the Adjust-A-Gate™ and Fit-Right™ products, which are the gate support systems for wood, vinyl, chain link, and composite fences. Management believes the ownership of these patents results in an important competitive advantage for these and certain other products. During fiscal 2022, the Company applied for one patent (fiscal 2021 – Nil) and received no patents (2021 – Nil). A patent granted in 2018 was an update of the Adjust-a-Gate™, which will extend the protection on the Adjust-a-Gate™ products for an additional 15 years.
 
Backlog orders are a factor in this business as customers may place firm priced orders for products for shipments to take place three to four months in the future.
 
Industrial Wood Products - Greenwood
 
Greenwood is a wholesale distributor of a variety of specialty wood products. Operations are co-located in the building utilized by JCC.
 
Historically, a major product category has been treated plywood that was sold into the marine industry. It migrated from that segment and focused more into the transportation industry. In February 2014, due to the falling marine market, the Company sold its remaining and excess inventory related to the marine industry. Greenwood’s total sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 4% and 5% respectively of total Company sales.
 
The primary market in which Greenwood competes has decreased in economic sensitivity as users are incorporating products into the municipal and mass transit transportations sectors. However, these markets may sustain some contractions due to COVID-19 related patterns of individuals utilizing transit and mass transit less due to concerns over exposure. In addition, this segment is prone to disruption of supply chain support which can impact other commodities outside of those specific to the disruption.
 
Inventory is maintained at non-owned warehouse and wood treating facilities throughout the United States and is primarily shipped to customers on a just-in-time basis. Inventory is generally not purchased on a speculative basis in anticipation of price changes.
 
Greenwood has no significant backlog of orders.
 
Seed Processing and Sales - JCSC 
 
JCSC operates out of an approximately 12 acre owned facility located adjacent to North Plains, Oregon. JCSC processes and distributes agricultural seed. Most of this segment’s sales come from selling seed to distributors with a lesser amount of sales derived from cleaning seed. Sales of seed has seasonality, but it is most affected by weather patterns in multiple parts of the United States that utilize cyclical planting. The annual weather plays an important part in year-to-year sales volatility and specific crop demand. However, profitability around after the month of August may be higher based on a seasonal surge in cleaning sales, which are more profitable than product sales.
 
JCSC often has a backlog of sales orders based on placement of future contracts so that buyers can capture key commodity supplies for specific crops due to seasonal patterns.
 
Administrative Services – JC USA
 
JC USA Inc. is the parent company for the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries as described above. JC USA provides professional and administrative services, including warehousing, accounting and credit services, to its subsidiary companies.

Tariffs
 
The Company’s metal and other products are largely manufactured in China and are imported into the United States. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) instituted new tariffs on the importation of a number of products into the United States from China effective September 24, 2018. These new tariffs are a response to what the USTR considers to be certain unfair trade practices by China. The tariffs began at 10%, and subsequently were increased to 25% as of May 10, 2019. A number of the Company’s products manufactured in China have been subject to duties of 25% when imported into the United States.
 
These new tariffs were temporarily reduced on many of the Company’s imported products in September 2019 under a deemed one-year exemption. The 25% tariff rate was restored on the Company’s products in September 2020 when the exemption expired.
 
Customer Concentration
 
The top ten customers were responsible for 84% and 81% of total Company sales for the years ended August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, respectively. Also, the Company’s single largest customer was responsible for 28% and 33% of total Company sales for the years ended August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021 respectively.
Employees
 
As of August 31, 2022 the Company had 75 full-time employees (August 31, 2021 – 74 full-time employees). By segment these employees were located as follows: Greenwood 1, JCC 44, JCSC 11, and JC USA 19. None of these employees are represented by unions at the Company. Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. has no direct employees, and the CEO of the Company is employed by JC USA.
