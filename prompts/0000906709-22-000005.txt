Item 1. Business
    Nektar Therapeutics is a research-based biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative medicines in areas of high unmet medical need. Our research and development pipeline of new investigational drugs includes potential therapies for oncology, immunology and virology. We leverage our proprietary and proven chemistry platform to discover and design new drug candidates. These drug candidates utilize our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action. We continue to make significant investments in building and advancing our pipeline of drug candidates as we believe that this is the best strategy to build long-term stockholder value. 
Our Drug Candidates and Technology Platform
We have a targeted portfolio of novel drug candidates aimed at selectively modulating pathways within the immune system that play critical roles in a wide range of serious diseases, including oncology, immunology and virology. In oncology, we are focused on activating the immune system’s natural tumor-fighting mechanisms, and we are studying several immuno-oncology (I-O) drug candidates in the clinic for a variety of cancer indications. These proprietary I-O candidates include bempegaldesleukin, NKTR-255 and NKTR-262, each in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents. 
In immunology, we are focused on addressing imbalances in the immune system to restore the body’s self-tolerance mechanisms and achieve immune homeostasis. In autoimmune disorders, our proprietary IL-2 T-regulatory (Treg) cell stimulator NKTR-358 is currently being clinically studied in systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.
In virology, we believe selective immuno-modulators can be useful in addressing viral infections in people. Our programs in this area include studying bempegaldesleukin in treating individuals affected with COVID-19, and a preclinical research collaboration with Gilead Sciences Inc. (Gilead) to test the combination of NKTR-255 with therapies in Gilead’s antiviral portfolio. 
Our drug candidates are generated from our advanced and proven polymer conjugation technology platform. Polymer conjugation or PEGylation has been a highly effective technology platform for the development of therapeutics with significant commercial success, such as Amgen’s Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) and UCB’s CIMZIA® (certolizumab pegol). Nearly all of the PEGylated drugs approved over the last fifteen years were enabled with our PEGylation technology through our collaborations and licensing partnerships with a number of well-known biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. PEGylation is a versatile technology as a result of polyethylene glycol (PEG) being a water soluble, amphiphilic, non-toxic, non-immunogenic compound that has been shown to safely clear from the body. Its primary use to date has been in currently approved biologic drugs to favorably alter their pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties. However, in spite of its widespread success in commercial drugs, there are some limitations with the first-generation PEGylation approaches that have been used with biologics. For example, these first generation techniques cannot be used successfully to create small molecule drugs which could potentially benefit from the application of the technology. Other limitations of the early applications of PEGylation technology include sub-optimal bioavailability and bioactivity, and its limited ability to be used to fine-tune properties of the drug.
    With our expertise and proprietary technology in polymer conjugation, we have created the next generation of PEGylation technology. Our advanced polymer conjugation technology platform is designed to overcome the limitations of first generation techniques to allow for the application of technology to a broader range of molecules across many therapeutic areas. We have also developed robust manufacturing processes for generating second generation PEGylation reagents that allow us to utilize the full potential of these newer technologies.
    Our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms have the potential to offer one or more of the following benefits:
•improve efficacy or safety of a drug as a result of better pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, longer half-life and sustained exposure of the drug;
•improve targeting or binding affinity of a drug to its target receptors with the potential to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity or drug resistance;
•improve solubility of a drug;
•enable oral administration of parenterally-administered drugs, or drugs that must be administered intravenously or subcutaneously, and increase oral bioavailability of small molecules;
•prevent drugs from crossing the blood-brain barrier, or reduce their rate of passage into the brain, thereby limiting undesirable central nervous system effects;
•reduce first-pass metabolism effects of certain drug classes with the potential to improve efficacy, which could reduce the need for other medicines and reduce toxicity;
•reduce the rates of drug absorption and of elimination or metabolism by improving stability of the drug in the body and providing it with more time to act on its target;
•differentially alter binding affinity of a drug for multiple receptors, improving its selectivity for one receptor over another; and
•reduce immune response to certain macromolecules with the potential to prolong their effectiveness with repeated doses.
    We have a broad range of technologies that we may use when designing our own drug candidates, some of which are further described below.
Large Molecule Releasable Polymer Conjugates (Cytokines)
    Our customized technologies with large molecule polymer conjugates can be applied to biologics, in particular cytokines, which utilize the polymer as a means to bias action to a certain receptor or receptor sub-type. In addition, a cytokine’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended. An example of this is bempegaldesleukin, which is a CD122-preferential IL-2 pathway agonist designed to stimulate the patient’s own immune system to fight cancer, without over-activating the immune system, with an every two or every three-week dosing schedule.
Large Molecule Polymer Conjugates (Proteins and Peptides)
    Our customized technologies with large molecule polymer conjugates have enabled numerous successful PEGylated biologics on the market today. Through rational drug design, a protein’s or peptide’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended. An example of this is Baxalta’s ADYNOVATE®, a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein, which was approved by the FDA in November 2015 for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A. In December 2016, the FDA expanded the approval of ADYNOVATE® for use in surgical settings for both adults and pediatric patients, and also for the treatment of Hemophilia A in pediatric patients under 12 years of age.
    Our scientists have shown that we can also optimize relative receptor binding characteristics of large molecule conjugates. For instance, the cytokine IL-2 has two different receptor complexes in the body that cause opposing effects on the immune system. We have engineered different novel conjugates of IL-2 with optimized differential receptor binding to the IL-2 receptor categories in the immune system. By biasing the receptor binding of these molecules in complementary ways, we have made two different drug candidates: bempegaldesleukin, which selectively activates effector T cells, which kill tumors; and NKTR-358, which selectively activates regulatory T cells, which can reduce the pathological immune activation that underlies many autoimmune diseases. 
Small Molecule Releasable Polymer Conjugates
    Our proprietary releasable polymer conjugation technology can be used to optimize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a small molecule drug to substantially increase its efficacy and improve its side effect profile. We are currently using this platform for NKTR-262. For NKTR-262 and other oncolytics, we believe this platform can improve sub-optimal half-lives that limit therapeutic efficacy. With our releasable polymer conjugate technology platform, we believe that oncolytic drugs can be modulated for programmed release within the body, optimized bioactivity and increased sustained exposure of active drug to tumor cells in the body.
Small Molecule Polymer Conjugates
    Our customized technology for small molecule polymer conjugates allows for the fine-tuning of the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of small molecule oral drugs to potentially increase their therapeutic benefit. In addition, this technology can enable oral administration of subcutaneously or intravenously delivered small molecule drugs that have low 

bioavailability when delivered orally. The benefits of this technology can also include: improved potency, modified biodistribution with enhanced pharmacodynamics, and reduced transport across specific membrane barriers in the body, such as the blood-brain barrier. An example of reducing transport across the blood-brain barrier is MOVANTIK®, an orally-available peripherally-acting opioid antagonist that is approved in the United States, the EU and other countries. 
Antibody Fragment Polymer Conjugates
    This technology uses a large molecular weight PEG conjugated to antibody fragments in order to potentially improve their toxicity profile, extend their half-life and allow for ease of synthesis with the antibody. The specially designed PEG replaces the function of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of full length antibodies with a branched architecture PEG with either stable or degradable linkage. This technology can be used to reduce antigenicity, reduce glomerular filtration rate, enhance uptake by inflamed tissues, and retain antigen-binding affinity and recognition. One approved product on the market that utilizes our technology with an antibody fragment is CIMZIA® (certoluzimab pegol), which was developed by our partner UCB and is approved for the treatment of Crohn’s Disease and ankylosing spondylitis in the U.S., axial spondyloarthritis in the EU and psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. and EU.
Our Strategy
    The key elements of our business strategy are described below:
Advance Our Clinical Pipeline of Drug Candidates that Leverages Our Deep Understanding of Immunology and Our Advanced Polymer Conjugate Platform
    Our objective is to create value by advancing our lead drug candidates through various stages of clinical development. To support this strategy, we leverage the expertise and experience within our internal research, preclinical, clinical development and regulatory departments. A key component of our development strategy is aimed at reducing the risks and time associated with drug development by capitalizing on the known safety and efficacy of existing drugs and drug candidates as well as established pharmacologic targets. For some of our novel drug candidates, we may seek to study the drug candidates in indications for which the parent drugs have not been studied or approved. We believe the improved characteristics of our drug candidates will provide meaningful benefit to patients compared to existing therapies. In addition, in certain instances, we have the opportunity to develop new treatments for patients for which the parent drugs are not currently approved.
Ensure Future Growth of our Pipeline through Internal Research Efforts and Advancement of our Preclinical Drug Candidates into Clinical Trials
    We believe it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business. Our discovery research organization is continuing to identify new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas. We continue to advance our most promising research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective of advancing these early-stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
Transition to a Fully-Integrated Specialty Biotechnology Company with a Commercial Capability in the I-O Therapeutic Area
    If we are successful with the development of bempegaldesleukin or one of our I-O drug candidates and one or more of them is approved, we plan to establish a commercial capability in the U.S. and other select major markets to market, sell and distribute these proprietary I-O therapies.  Under our BMS Collaboration Agreement, we retained significant global commercial rights to bempegaldesleukin including global co-promotion rights for all combinations of bempegaldesleukin with any BMS proprietary therapy, and we lead global commercialization for all other bempegaldesleukin combination regimens. We also have the contractual right under our BMS Collaboration Agreement to record all worldwide sales and revenue for bempegaldesleukin and we have final decision-making authority regarding the pricing of bempegaldesleukin.
Selectively Enter into Strategic Collaboration Agreements
    We decide on a drug-candidate-by-drug-candidate basis, how far to advance clinical development (e.g., Phase 1, 2 or 3) and whether to commercialize products on our own, or seek a partner, or pursue a combination of these approaches. When we determine to seek a partner, our strategy is to selectively access a partner’s development, regulatory, or commercial capabilities with the structure of the collaboration depending on factors such as economic risk sharing, the cost and complexity 

of development, marketing and commercialization needs, therapeutic areas, potential for combination of drug programs, and geographic capabilities.
Continue to Build a Leading Intellectual Property Estate across Therapeutic Modalities
    We are committed to continuing to build on our intellectual property position to protect our scientific and therapeutic advances, whether in the I-O therapeutic area, the field of polymer conjugate chemistry or otherwise. To that end, we have a comprehensive patent strategy with the objective of developing a patent estate covering a wide range of novel inventions, including among others, compositions of matter (such as our drug candidates, formulations, conjugates, and polymeric materials), methods of treatment, and methods of manufacture.

Overview of Our Pipeline
Immuno-oncology (I-O)
In the area of oncology, we have a particular focus on developing medicines in the area of I-O, which is a therapeutic approach based on targeting biological pathways that stimulate and sustain the body’s immune response in order to fight cancer. We are developing medicines designed to directly or indirectly modulate the activity of key immune cells, such as cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, to increase their numbers and to improve their function to recognize and attack cancer cells.
Bempegaldesleukin (previously known as NKTR-214, cytokine immunostimulatory therapy)
    Bempegaldesleukin is a CD122-preferential IL-2 pathway agonist designed to stimulate the patient’s own immune system to fight cancer without over-activating the immune system.  Bempegaldesleukin is designed to grow specific cancer-killing T cells and natural (NK) cell populations in the body, which are known as endogenous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Bempegaldesleukin stimulates these cancer-killing immune cells in the body by targeting CD122-specific receptors found on the surface of these immune cells, known as CD8+ effector T cells and NK cells. CD122, which is also known as the 

IL-2 receptor beta subunit, is a key signaling receptor that is known to increase proliferation of these CD8+ effector T cells. This receptor selectivity is intended to increase efficacy and improve safety over existing immunostimulatory cytokine drugs. Our strategic objective is to establish bempegaldesleukin as a key component of many I-O combination regimens with the potential to improve the standard of care in multiple oncology settings. To this end, we are executing a comprehensive clinical development program for bempegaldesleukin, including a broad clinical collaboration with the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), several clinical collaborations with other third parties with pharmacological agents that have potential complementary mechanisms to bempegaldesleukin, as well as pursuing our own independent clinical studies.
    The development program for bempegaldesleukin includes combinations with a number of therapeutic approaches where we believe there is a strong biologic rationale for complementary mechanisms of action. On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement with BMS, pursuant to which we and BMS collaborated to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials evaluating bempegaldesleukin and BMS’ human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1, known as Opdivo®, as a potential combination treatment regimen in five tumor types and eight potential indications (each, a Combined Therapy Trial). In the first phase of the PIVOT-02 study, we evaluated the clinical benefit, safety, and tolerability of combining bempegaldesleukin with Opdivo® in thirty-eight patients. Interim data from the dose-escalation phase of the trial was presented at the 2017 SITC meeting in November 2017. We identified the recommended Phase 2 dose for bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo®. The second phase of the expansion cohorts, which now falls under the BMS Collaboration Agreement entered into on February 13, 2018, and described below, is evaluating the safety and efficacy of combining bempegaldesleukin with Opdivo®. On August 1, 2019, we and BMS announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo® for the treatment of patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines aimed at treating serious or life-threatening disease where there is preliminary evidence that the investigational therapy may offer substantial improvement over existing therapies on at least one clinically significant endpoint.
On February 13, 2018, we entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement with BMS (as amended to date, the BMS Collaboration Agreement) that outlined a collaboration for the co-development and co-commercialization of bempegaldesleukin in combination regimens with BMS medicines including Opdivo®. On April 3, 2018, the closing date of the transaction, BMS paid us a non-refundable upfront cash payment of $1.0 billion and purchased $850.0 million of our common stock at a purchase price of $102.60 per share pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (Purchase Agreement). We are eligible to receive additional cash payments up to a total of approximately $1.455 billion (including the milestones which we have already received under the BMS Collaboration Agreement) upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, and up to a total of $350.0 million upon achievement of certain sales milestones. 
The collaboration development plan (the Collaboration Development Plan) under the BMS Collaboration Agreement is evaluating bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo® in ongoing registrational trials in first-line metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, first-line cisplatin ineligible, PD-L1 low, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, first-line metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and muscle-invasive bladder cancer, as well as a Phase 1/2 dose escalation and expansion study to evaluate bempegaldesleukin plus Opdivo® in combination with either axitinib or cabozantinib in first line RCC in order to support a future Phase 3 registrational trial. We and BMS share development costs based on each party’s relative ownership interest in the compounds included in the regimen. For example, we share clinical development costs for bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo®, BMS 67.5% and Nektar 32.5%. For costs of manufacturing bempegaldesleukin, however, BMS is responsible for 35% and Nektar is responsible for 65% of costs. For indications not included in the Collaboration Development Plan, the parties are free to develop their own medicines in other indications subject to certain cost sharing, premium reimbursement, and timing terms and conditions. 
Under the co-commercialization portion of the BMS Collaboration Agreement, we will book all worldwide sales and revenue for bempegaldesleukin. We and BMS will share global commercialization profits and losses for bempegaldesleukin, with Nektar sharing 65% and BMS sharing 35% of the net profits and losses. Each party bears their own non-product specific core commercialization infrastructure costs. We retain the final decision-making authority regarding the pricing for bempegaldesleukin. Bempegaldesleukin will be sold on a stand-alone basis and there will be no fixed-dose combinations or co-packaging without the consent of both parties. On January 12, 2022, we and BMS entered into an Amendment No. 2 to the BMS Collaboration Agreement pursuant to which we and BMS allocated certain responsibilities related to price negotiations and promotion, market access, patient support and related activities to each party. The commercial economics under the BMS Collaboration Agreement remain unchanged under this amendment. 
Outside of the Collaboration Development Plan with BMS, we are also conducting a broad array of development activities evaluating bempegaldesleukin in combination with other agents that have potential complementary mechanisms of action. For example, as specifically allowed under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, we are independently studying 

bempegaldesleukin in combination with Keytruda®, a PD-1 inhibitor. We are also working with Vaccibody AS to evaluate bempegaldesleukin with Vaccibody's personalized cancer neoantigen vaccine in a Phase 1 proof-of-concept study. 
 On February 12, 2021, we entered into a financing and co-development collaboration (the SFJ Agreement) with SFJ Pharmaceuticals XII, L.P., a SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group company (SFJ), pursuant to which SFJ will pay up to $150.0 million in committed funding to support a Phase 2/3 study of bempegaldesleukin in combination with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (the SCCHN Clinical Trial) whose tumors express PD-L1 (the SCCHN Indication). SFJ Pharmaceuticals is a global drug development company backed by Blackstone Life Sciences and Abingworth. On February 11, 2021, we entered into a collaboration agreement with MSD International GmbH (MSD), an affiliate of Merck, Sharp & Dohme, pursuant to which MSD will provide Keytruda® at no cost for use in the SCCHN Clinical Trial but will not bear any other costs of the trial.
SFJ will have primary responsibility for the clinical trial management of the SCCHN Clinical Trial, and we will be the sponsor of the SCCHN Clinical Trial and will also have sole responsibility for regulatory interactions and filings for bempegaldesleukin. The SCCHN Clinical Trial provides for an interim futility analysis, and unless the futility criteria are met, SFJ is required to complete the SCCHN Trial, but if the futility criteria are met, SFJ has the responsibility to wind down the SCCHN Clinical Trial at its sole cost. We and BMS, pursuant to the BMS Collaboration Agreement, remain solely responsible for conducting the Phase 3 clinical trials of bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo®, including the treatment of previously untreated unresectable or metastatic melanoma (the “Melanoma Indication” and the “Melanoma Clinical Trial”).
Other than the opportunity to receive Success Payments as outlined below, SFJ has no right to reimbursement of costs incurred by SFJ for the SCCHN Clinical Trial in the event that the Melanoma Clinical Trial and the SCCHN Clinical Trial do not achieve FDA approval. We will pay SFJ a series of success-based annual payments (collectively, the Success Payments) in the event of FDA approval of bempegaldesleukin for the Melanoma Indication, the SCCHN Indication, or both, and in the event of FDA approval of one additional bempegaldesleukin indication. The Success Payments do not begin until the substantial completion of the SCCHN Clinical Trial. The total success-based annual payments for the first indication approved by FDA, whether for the Melanoma Indication or the SCCHN Indication, is an aggregate of $450.0 million, paid in annual contractual payments over five years, with the first payment being $30.0 million, with the earliest possible payment expected to occur in late 2024 or early 2025, subject to the substantial completion of the SCCHN Clinical Trial. The total success-based payments for the second indication approved by FDA, whether for the Melanoma Indication or the SCCHN Indication, is an aggregate of $150.0 million, paid in annual contractual payments over seven years. Finally, in the event of FDA approval for bempegaldesleukin for any indication other than the Melanoma Indication or the SCCHN Indication, we will make a one-time payment of $37.5 million to SFJ. If the success criterion for the interim futility analysis is not met and SFJ winds down the SCCHN Clinical Trial, then the Success Payments, if any, for the Melanoma Indication and/or the additional bempegaldesleukin indication are reduced pro rata based on the costs incurred by SFJ for the SCCHN Clinical Trial over the aggregate commitment of $150.0 million.
The SFJ Agreement provides for certain positive and negative covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our intellectual property related to bempegaldesleukin (the bempegaldesleukin IP), or assign or convey any right to receive income with respect to the bempegaldesleukin IP (other than royalty and other license fee obligations to licensors), except for the issuance of senior secured debt secured by all or substantially all of our assets, including the bempegaldesleukin IP. 
The SFJ Agreement expires upon the payment of all Success Payments to SFJ, unless earlier terminated as provided under the SFJ Agreement. The SFJ Agreement may be terminated by either party for a safety or health concern for the patients, whether by the independent data monitoring company or by mutual agreement of both parties. The SFJ Agreement may also be terminated by either party for material breach or insolvency of the counterparty.
    With our non-BMS clinical collaborations for bempegaldesleukin, generally each party supports the collaboration based on its expertise and resources. For example, in February 2021, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck wherein we will receive supplies of Keytruda® at no cost to us. We expect to continue to make significant and increasing investments exploring the potential of bempegaldesleukin with mechanisms of action that we believe are synergistic with bempegaldesleukin based on emerging scientific findings in cancer biology and preclinical development work.
    In addition to these non-BMS clinical collaborations for bempegaldesleukin, we intend to initiate further clinical development programs, on our own or in collaboration with other potential partners, to explore the potential of combining bempegaldesleukin with other therapies such as cancer vaccines (other than Vaccibody’s personalized cancer neoantigen vaccine), adoptive cell therapy, and other small molecules and biological agents in order to generate novel immuno-oncology approaches.

NKTR-255
NKTR-255 is a biologic that targets the IL-15 pathway in order to activate the body’s innate and adaptive immunity. Activation of the IL-15 pathway enhances the survival and function of NK cells and induces survival of both effector and CD8 memory T cells. Recombindant human IL-15 is rapidly cleared from the body and must be administered frequently and in high doses limiting its utility due to toxicity. Through optimal engagement of the IL-15 receptor complex, NKTR-255 is designed to enhance functional NK cell populations and the formation of long-term immunological memory, which may lead to sustained anti-tumor immune response. We have initiated a Phase 1 clinical study of NKTR-255 in adults with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma, as well as a Phase 1/2 clinical study of NKTR-255 in patients with relapsed or refractory head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or colorectal cancer. Additionally, we have entered into a separate preclinical research collaboration with Janssen to test the combination of NKTR-255 with therapies in Janssen’s oncology portfolio. 
NKTR-262
    NKTR-262 is a small molecule agonist that targets toll-like receptors (TLRs) found on innate immune cells in the body. NKTR-262 is designed to overcome the body’s dysfunction of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, which are critical to induce the body’s adaptive immunity and create antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. NKTR-262 is being developed as a single intra-tumoral injection to be administered at the start of therapy with bempegaldesleukin in order to induce an abscopal response and achieve the goal of tumor regression in cancer patients treated with both therapies. We have completed the dose-escalation portion of a Phase 1/2 clinical study, which we call the REVEAL study, and the dose-expansion portion of the study is ongoing.
Immunology
NKTR-358, Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company 
 NKTR-358 is designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body which occurs in patients with autoimmune disease. Current systemic treatments for autoimmune disease, including corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents, suppress the immune system broadly and come with severe side effects. NKTR-358 targets the CD25 sub-receptor in the IL-2 pathway in order to stimulate proliferation and growth of regulatory T cells, which are specific immune cells in the body that modulate the immune system and prevent autoimmune disease by maintaining self-tolerance.
 On July 23, 2017, we entered into a worldwide license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), pursuant to which we and Lilly will co‑develop NKTR-358 (Lilly Agreement). Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, we received an initial payment of $150.0 million in September 2017 and are eligible for up to $250.0 million in additional development and regulatory milestones. We are responsible for completing Phase 1 clinical development and certain drug product development and drug supply responsibilities assigned to us under the Lilly Agreement. We will share Phase 2 development costs with Lilly, with Lilly responsible for 75% and Nektar responsible for 25% of these costs. We will also have the option to contribute funding to Phase 3 development on an indication-by-indication basis, ranging from zero to 25% of the global Phase 3 development costs. We are eligible to receive up to double-digit sales royalty rates that escalate based upon our contribution to Phase 3 development costs and the level of global product annual sales. Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization and we have an option to co-promote in the U.S. under certain conditions.
We have completed a Phase 1 dose-finding trial of NKTR-358 to evaluate single-ascending doses of NKTR-358 in approximately 100 healthy patients. We also completed treatment of a Phase 1 multiple-ascending dose trial to evaluate NKTR-358 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Lilly is conducting two Phase 1b studies in patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and initiated a Phase 2 study in SLE in October 2020 and a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis in March 2021. In addition, Lilly is planning to initiate a Phase 2 study in atopic dermatitis based on positive interim Phase 1b results in that indication and also plans to initiate another Phase 2 study in another immune-mediated disease.
Virology
Our drug candidates, bempegaldesleukin and NKTR-255, also have potential applications in the area of virology. With regard to bempegaldesleukin, we believe this drug candidate’s ability to directly increase the numbers of anti-viral CD4+, CD8+ and NK lymphocytes, which are known to be critical for the resolution of many viral infections in people, and specifically infections with respiratory coronaviruses in a variety of animal models, could be useful as a therapeutic in treating individuals affected with COVID-19. We completed a Phase 1b clinical trial of bempegaldesleukin plus standard of care for treatment of adults with mild COVID-19.

With regard to NKTR-255, we believe this drug candidate’s ability to activate and proliferate NK cells and memory CD8+ T cells to target activated CD4+ T cells can result in killing virus-infected cells. We have entered into a preclinical research collaboration with Gilead to test the combination of NKTR-255 with therapies in Gilead’s antiviral portfolio. 
Collaboration Partner Programs

We have a number of other drug candidates in clinical development and approved products in collaboration with our partners where we invented the drug candidate or where our collaboration partners have licensed our proprietary intellectual property to enable one of their drug candidates. The following table outlines our collaborations with a number of pharmaceutical companies that currently license our intellectual property and, in some cases, purchase our proprietary PEGylation materials for their drug products. More than ten products using our PEGylation technology have received regulatory approval in the U.S. or Europe. There are also a number of other candidates that have been filed for approval or are in various stages of clinical development. These collaborations generally contain one or more elements including a license to our intellectual property rights and manufacturing and supply agreements under which we may receive manufacturing revenue, milestone payments, and/or royalties on commercial sales of drug products.

 *    In December 2020, pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement (the “2020 Purchase and Sale Agreement”) we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide new sales of ADYNOVATE®/ADYNOVI® and MOVANTIK®/MOVANTIG® (as well as REBINYN® and specified licensed products under a Right to Sublicense Agreement, dated October 27, 2017) from and after October 1, 2020 until the purchaser of these rights has received payments equal to $210.0 million (the “2025 Threshold”), if the 2025 Threshold is achieved on or prior to December 31, 2025, or $240.0 million, if the 2025 Threshold is not achieved on or prior to December 31, 2025 (or, if earlier, the date on which the last royalty payment under the relevant license agreements is made). All rights to receive royalties will return to Nektar once the 2020 Purchase and Sale Agreement expires.
** In February 2012, we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of CIMZIA® and MIRCERA® effective as of January 1, 2012.
    With respect to all of our collaboration and license agreements with third parties, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, including without limitation, “We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition” and “We are involved in legal proceedings and may incur substantial litigation costs and liabilities that will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.” 
Overview of Ongoing Collaboration Partner Programs
ADYNOVATE® (previously referred to as BAX 855), ADYNOVI® (brand name for ADYNOVATE® in Europe) and Longer-Acting Blood Clotting Proteins for Hemophilia A, Agreement with Subsidiaries of Baxalta Incorporated
In September 2005, we entered into an exclusive research, development, license, manufacturing and supply agreement (Baxalta License Agreement) with certain subsidiaries of Baxalta (which has been acquired by Takeda), to develop products with an extended half-life for the treatment and prophylaxis of Hemophilia A patients using our proprietary PEGylation technology. Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII, a clotting protein. The first product in this collaboration, ADYNOVATE® (previously referred to as BAX 855), is a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein that was developed to increase the half-life of ADVATE® (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) Plasma/Albumin-Free Method). ADYNOVATE® was first approved by the FDA on November 30, 2015.  Since then it has been approved in one or more indications for Hemophilia A in the EU, Japan, and other countries around the world.
In December 2020, pursuant to the 2020 Purchase and Sale Agreement we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide new sales of ADYNOVATE®/ADYNOVI® and from the third party products under a right to sublicense agreement from and after October 1, 2020 until the purchaser of these rights has received payments equal to $210.0 million (the “2025 Threshold”), if the 2025 Threshold is achieved on or prior to December 31, 2025, or $240.0 million, if the 2025 Threshold is not achieved on or prior to December 31, 2025 (or, if earlier, the date on which the last royalty payment under the relevant license agreements is made). All rights to receive royalties will return to Nektar once the 2020 Purchase and Sale Agreement expires. This 2020 Purchase and Sale Agreement is further discussed in Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
MOVANTIK® and MOVENTIG® (brand name for MOVANTIK® in Europe), Agreement with AstraZeneca AB
    In September 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) pursuant to which we granted AstraZeneca a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual, royalty-bearing license under our patents and other intellectual property to develop, market and sell MOVANTIK®. MOVANTIK® was developed using our oral small molecule polymer conjugate technology and we advanced this drug through the completion of Phase 2 clinical studies prior to licensing it to AstraZeneca. MOVANTIK® is an orally-available peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist which is a medication for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC), which is a common side effect of prescription opioid medications. Opioids attach to specific proteins called opioid receptors. When the opioids attach to certain opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, constipation may occur. 

    On September 16, 2014, the FDA approved MOVANTIK® as the first once-daily oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) medication for the treatment of OIC in adult patients with chronic, non-cancer pain. On December 9, 2014, the European Commission (EC), granted Marketing Authorisation to MOVENTIG® (the naloxegol brand name in the European Union (EU)) as the first once-daily oral PAMORA to be approved in the EU for the treatment of OIC in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s). The EC’s approval applies to all EU member countries plus Iceland and Norway. AstraZeneca launched the commercial sales of MOVANTIK® in the U.S. in March 2015 and MOVENTIG® in Germany, the first EU member country, in August 2015. 
In December 2020, pursuant to the 2020 Purchase and Sale Agreement, we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide new sales of MOVANTIK®/MOVANTIG® from and after October 1, 2020 until the purchaser of these rights has received payments equal to $210.0 million (the “2025 Threshold”), if the 2025 Threshold is achieved on or prior to December 31, 2025, or $240.0 million, if the 2025 Threshold is not achieved on or prior to December 31, 2025 (or, if earlier, the date on which the last royalty payment under the relevant license agreements is made). All rights to receive royalties will return to Nektar once the 2020 Purchase and Sale Agreement expires. This 2020 Purchase and Sale Agreement is further discussed in Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. AstraZeneca has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop one MOVANTIK® fixed-dose combination product and has the right to develop multiple products which combine MOVANTIK® with opioids. 
CIMZIA®, Agreement with UCB
    In December 2000, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement covering our proprietary PEGylation materials for use in CIMZIA® (certolizumab pegol) with Celltech Chiroscience Ltd., which was acquired by UCB in 2004. Under the terms of the agreement, UCB is responsible for all clinical development, regulatory, and commercialization expenses. We also manufacture and supply UCB with our proprietary PEGylation reagent used in the manufacture of CIMZIA® on a fixed price per gram. We were also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of the CIMZIA® product for the longer of ten years from the first commercial sale of the product anywhere in the world or the expiration of patent rights in a particular country. In February 2012, we sold our rights to receive royalties on all future worldwide net sales of CIMZIA® effective as of January 1, 2012 until the agreement with UCB is terminated or expires. This sale is further discussed in Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our agreement with UCB Pharma expires upon the expiration of all of UCB’s royalty obligations, provided that the agreement can be extended for successive two year renewal periods upon mutual agreement of the parties. In addition, UCB may terminate the agreement should it cease the development and marketing of CIMZIA® and either party may terminate for cause under certain conditions.
MIRCERA® (C.E.R.A.) (Continuous Erythropoietin Receptor Activator), Agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.
    In December 2000, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche), which was amended and restated in its entirety in December 2005. Pursuant to the agreement, we license our intellectual property related to our proprietary PEGylation materials for the manufacture and commercialization of Roche’s MIRCERA® product. MIRCERA® is a novel continuous erythropoietin receptor activator indicated for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease in patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. As of the end of 2006, we were no longer required to manufacture and supply our proprietary PEGylation materials for MIRCERA® under our original agreement. In February 2012, we entered into a toll-manufacturing agreement with Roche under which we manufactured our proprietary PEGylation material for MIRCERA®. As of December 31, 2016, we no longer had any continuing manufacturing or supply obligations under this MIRCERA® agreement. We were also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of the MIRCERA® product. In February 2012, we sold all of our future rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of MIRCERA® effective as of January 1, 2012. This sale is further discussed in Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Macugen®, Agreement with Bausch Health Companies Inc., formerly Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.
 In 2002, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with Eyetech, Inc. (subsequently acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. or Valeant), pursuant to which we license certain intellectual property related to our proprietary PEGylation technology for the development and commercialization of Macugen®, a PEGylated anti-vascular endothelial growth factor aptamer currently approved in the U.S. and EU for age-related macular degeneration. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive royalties on net product sales in any particular country for the longer of ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country or the duration of patent coverage. Our agreement with Valeant expires upon the expiration of our last relevant patent containing a valid claim. In addition, Valeant may terminate the 

agreement if marketing authorization is withdrawn or marketing is no longer feasible due to certain circumstances, and either party may terminate for cause if certain conditions are met.
Somavert®, Agreement with Pfizer, Inc.
    In January 2000, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement (LMS Agreement) with Sensus Drug Development Corporation (subsequently acquired by Pharmacia Corp. in 2001 and then acquired by Pfizer in 2003), for the PEGylation of Somavert® (pegvisomant), a human growth hormone receptor antagonist for the treatment of acromegaly. In January 2017, we entered into a master material supply agreement (Supply Agreement) with Pfizer, in which the LMS Agreement was terminated. We currently manufacture our proprietary PEGylation reagent for Pfizer on a price per gram basis under the Supply Agreement. Our obligation under the Supply Agreement to supply our proprietary PEGylation reagent to Pfizer continues until December 31, 2023.
Dapirolizumab Pegol, Agreement with UCB Pharma S.A.
    In 2010, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma S.A., (UCB) under which we granted UCB a worldwide, exclusive license to certain of our proprietary PEGylation technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize an anti-CD40L PEGylated Fab being developed by UCB and their partner Biogen Idec, for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythemastosus (SLE). Most recently, in July 2019, Biogen announced a plan to initiate with UCB a Phase 3 study of dapriolizumab pegol in patients with active SLE, which clinical study is currently ongoing. 
Government Regulation
Product Development and Approval Process
    The research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of products using our technologies are subject to regulation by the FDA and by comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. These national agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing (in vitro, in animals, and in human clinical trials), manufacture, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, marketing, advertising and promotion of our products.
    The approval process required by the FDA before a product using any of our technologies may be marketed in the U.S. depends on whether the chemical composition of the product has previously been approved for use in other dosage forms. If the product is a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved, the process includes the following:
•extensive preclinical laboratory and animal testing;
•submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) prior to commencing clinical trials;
•adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for the intended indication; 
•extensive pharmaceutical development for the characterization of the chemistry, manufacturing process and controls for the active ingredient and drug product; and
•submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) for approval of a drug or a Biological License Application (BLA) for approval of a biological product.
    If the active chemical ingredient has been previously approved by the FDA, the approval process is similar, except that certain preclinical tests, including those relating to systemic toxicity normally required for the IND and NDA or BLA, and clinical trials, may not be necessary if the company has a right of reference to existing preclinical or clinical data under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or is eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or the biosimilars provisions of the Public Health Services Act.
    Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to assess the safety and efficacy of the product and its chosen formulation. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA good laboratory practices (GLP) regulations. The results of the preclinical tests for drugs, biological products and combination products subject to the primary jurisdiction of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and are reviewed by the FDA before clinical trials can begin. Clinical trials may begin 30 days after receipt of the IND by the FDA, unless the FDA raises objections or requires clarification within that period. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy volunteers or patients 

under the supervision of a qualified, identified medical investigator according to a protocol submitted in the IND for FDA review. Drug products to be used in clinical trials must be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety and product efficacy as well as other criteria to be evaluated in the study. Each protocol is submitted to the FDA in the IND.
    Apart from the IND process described above, each clinical study must be reviewed by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the IRB must be kept current with respect to the status of the clinical study. The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, the potential risks to subjects participating in the trial and the possible liability to the institution where the trial is conducted. The IRB also reviews and approves the informed consent form to be signed by the trial participants and any significant changes in the clinical trial.
    Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases. Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects (in most cases) and the product generally is tested for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, absorption, metabolism and excretion. Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to:
•determine the preliminary efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications;
•determine dosage and regimen of administration; and
•identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
    If Phase 2 trials demonstrate that a product appears to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are typically undertaken to evaluate the further clinical efficacy and safety of the drug and formulation within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites and in large enough trials to provide statistical proof of efficacy and tolerability. The FDA, the clinical trial sponsor, the investigators or the IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time if any one of them believes that study participants are being subjected to an unacceptable health risk. In some cases, the FDA and the drug sponsor may determine that Phase 2 trials are not needed prior to entering Phase 3 trials.
    Following a series of formal meetings and communications between the drug sponsor and the regulatory agencies, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as an NDA or BLA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the drug product. The FDA may deny approval if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or pharmaceutical testing or requirements. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy all of the criteria for approval. Additionally, the approved labeling may narrowly limit the conditions of use of the product, including the intended uses, or impose warnings, precautions or contraindications which could significantly limit the potential market for the product. Further, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose post-market surveillance, or Phase 4, studies or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. Product approvals, once obtained, may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety concerns arise after the product reaches the market. The FDA may require additional post-marketing clinical testing and pharmacovigilance programs to monitor the effect of drug products that have been commercialized and has the power to prevent or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of such programs. After approval, there are ongoing reporting obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the product, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected adverse events.
    Each manufacturing establishment producing the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product for the U.S. market must be registered with the FDA and typically is inspected by the FDA prior to NDA or BLA approval of a drug product manufactured by such establishment. Such inspections are also held periodically after commercialization. Manufacturing establishments of U.S. marketed products are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements. They are also subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulations regarding workplace safety, environmental protection and hazardous controls, among others.
    In situations where our partners are responsible for clinical and regulatory approval procedures, we may still participate in this process by submitting to the FDA a drug master file developed and maintained by us which contains data concerning the manufacturing processes for polymer conjugation materials or drug product. For those products for which we have development responsibility, we prepare and submit an IND and are responsible for additional clinical and regulatory procedures for drug candidates being developed under an IND. The clinical and manufacturing, development and regulatory review and approval process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Our ability to manufacture and market products, whether developed by us or under collaboration agreements, ultimately depends upon the completion of satisfactory clinical trials and success in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and equivalent foreign health authorities.

    Sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to local regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs. Such requirements vary widely from country to country.
In the U.S., the FDA may grant Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation to a drug candidate, which allows the FDA to expedite the review of new drugs that are intended for serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. Important features of Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation include a potentially reduced clinical program and close, early communication between the FDA and the sponsor company to improve the efficiency of product development. On August 1, 2019, we and BMS announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo® for the treatment of patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
In the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. The company that obtains the first FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years. In addition, the Orphan Drug Act provides for protocol assistance, tax credits, research grants, and exclusions from user fees for sponsors of orphan products. Once a product receives orphan drug exclusivity, a second product that is considered to be the same drug for the same indication generally may be approved during the exclusivity period only if the second product is shown to be “clinically superior” to the original orphan drug in that it is more effective, safer or otherwise makes a “major contribution to patient care” or the holder of exclusive approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Similar incentives also are available for orphan drugs in the EU.
Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing
    Sales of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval depend, in part, on the coverage and reimbursement status of those products. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Other countries and jurisdictions will also have their own unique mechanisms for approval and reimbursement.
    The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payers may also refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Further, private payers often follow the coverage and payment policies established by certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, which require manufacturers to comply with certain rebate, price reporting, and other obligations. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which is part of the Medicaid program (a program for financially needy patients, among others), requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services under which the manufacturer agrees to report certain prices to the government and pay rebates to state Medicaid programs on outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients, as a condition for receiving federal reimbursement for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Further, in order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program.
    Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the price of therapeutics have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement, among other controls. Adoption of price controls or other cost-containment measures could limit coverage for or the amounts that federal and state governments or private payers will pay for health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or additional pricing pressures and affect our ultimate profitability, if approved. If third-party payers do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.

    The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
    If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
•federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money owed to the federal government;
•provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes, referred to as the “HIPAA All-payer Fraud Prohibition,” that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
•federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and disclose payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer, and that such information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners;
•provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
•state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and which may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
    If our drug candidates become commercialized, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity and oversight agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. 
    The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the Affordable Care Act), enacted in 2010, expanded the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal fraud statutes 

contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
    The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payers, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal health care programs for the product. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,463 and $23,331 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
    In each country or jurisdiction outside of the U.S. in which we seek and receive regulatory approval to commercialize our products, we will be subject to additional laws and regulations specific to those locations. These regulations and laws will also impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs in those jurisdictions.
Legislative and Regulatory Landscape
    From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, marketing, coverage and reimbursement of products regulated by the FDA or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, FDA and healthcare fraud and abuse and coverage and reimbursement regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. While specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent, there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future that could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from therapeutic candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Furthermore, federal agencies, Congress, state legislatures, and the private sector have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit coverage for or the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures and affect our ultimate profitability.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
    We own more than 310 U.S. and 1,200 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies. We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our drug candidates. More specifically, our patents and patent applications cover polymer architecture, drug conjugates, formulations, methods of making polymers and polymer conjugates, methods of administering polymer conjugates, and methods of manufacturing polymers and polymer conjugates. Our patent portfolio contains patents and patent applications that encompass our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms. Our patent strategy is to file patent applications on innovations and improvements to cover a significant majority of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world. Generally, patents have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date (assuming all maintenance fees are paid). In some instances, patent terms can be increased or decreased, depending on the laws and regulations of the country or jurisdiction that issued the patent.
    We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to, or disclose, our trade secrets. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, 

including but not limited to “We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.” In certain situations in which we work with drugs covered by one or more patents, our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies may be affected by limitations in our access to these proprietary drugs. Even if we believe we are free to work with a proprietary drug, we cannot guarantee that we will not be accused of, or determined to be, infringing a third party’s rights and be prohibited from working with the drug or found liable for damages. Any such restriction on access or liability for damages would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
    The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues. There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law. Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly. Additionally, issued patents can be subject to inter partes review, opposition, reexamination or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent but in an amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant or broad coverage). Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents. Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patent. We may have to participate in post-grant proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, including without limitation, “If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.”
    U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights exist that are owned by third parties and relate to pharmaceutical compositions and reagents, and equipment and methods for preparation, packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, of these rights will be considered relevant to our technology by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternative technology. The failure to obtain licenses if needed may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, including without limitation, “We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our drug candidates on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.”
    It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Customer Concentrations
    Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements with partners, under which we may receive a combination of revenue elements including up-front payments for licensing agreements, clinical research reimbursement or co-funding, milestone payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties and/or product sales revenue. Our revenues are concentrated among a limited number of collaboration partners under long-term arrangements. We derive the substantial majority of our product sales from UCB and Pfizer. Following the 2020 Purchase and Sale Agreement (wherein under a capped return sale arrangement we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide new sales of MOVANTIK®/MOVANTIG® and ADYNOVATE®/ADYNOVI®, as well as REBINYN® and specified licensed products), other than our product sales, substantially all of our revenues are non-cash royalty revenues. However, our collaborations with BMS and Lilly for the development of bempegaldesleukin and NKTR-358, respectively, provide for the most significant portion of our potential future development and regulatory milestone payments, as well as royalties from net sales of NKTR-358, if approved. Additionally, these collaboration partners provide significant financial support for the development and commercialization of these programs. BMS bears 67.5% of the costs of developing bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo®, 35% of the costs of manufacturing bempegaldesleukin and 35% of the costs of joint commercialization. Lilly bears 

75% of the costs of Phase 2 development of NKTR-358, will bear 100% of the costs of Phase 3 development, subject to our right to contribute up to 25% of Phase 3 development costs on an indication-by-indication basis in exchange for higher royalties, if approved, and will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization, subject to our option to co-promote in the U.S. under certain conditions.
Competition
    Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is intense and characterized by aggressive research and development and rapidly-evolving science, technology, and standards of medical care throughout the world. We frequently compete with pharmaceutical companies and other institutions with greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities. We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
Science and Technology Competition
    We face intense science and technology competition from a multitude of technologies seeking to enhance the efficacy, safety and ease of use of approved drugs and new drug molecule candidates. A number of the drug candidates in our pipeline have direct and indirect competition from large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies. With our advanced polymer conjugate technologies, we believe we have competitive advantages relating to factors such as efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost for certain applications and molecules. We constantly monitor scientific and medical developments in order to improve our current technologies, seek licensing opportunities where appropriate, and determine the best applications for our technology platforms.
    In the fields of advanced polymer conjugate technologies, our competitors include Biogen Idec Inc., Horizon Pharma, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd., Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, NOF Corporation, and Novo Nordisk A/S (assets formerly held by Neose Technologies, Inc.). Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing advanced polymer conjugate technology or technologies intended to deliver similar scientific and medical benefits. Some of these companies license intellectual property or PEGylation materials to other companies, while others apply the technology to create their own drug candidates.
Product and Program Specific Competition
Bempegaldesleukin
There are numerous companies engaged in developing immunotherapies to be used alone, or in combination, to treat a wide range of oncology indications targeting both solid and liquid tumors. In particular, we expect to compete in the cytokine-based therapies space with potential competitors including Alkermes PLC, Asher Biotherapeutics, Aulos Bioscience, Bright Peak Therapeutics, Cue Biopharma, Neoleukin, Sanofi SA (through its acquisition of Synthorx, Inc.), Synthekine, Inc., Werewolf Therapeutics, and Xilio Therapeutics. We may also face competition from other therapeutic approaches including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, and chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells, or CAR-Ts. Potential competitors in the TIL and CAR-T space include Gilead (through its acquisition of Kite Pharma)/NCI, Apeiron Biologics, Philogen S.p.A., Brooklyn ImmunoTherapeutics LLC, Anaveon AG, Adaptimmune LLC, and Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. 
NKTR-358
    There are a number of competitors in various stages of clinical development that are working on programs which are designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body due to autoimmune disease. In particular, we expect to compete with therapies that could be cytokine-based therapies (Symbiotix, LLC, Jassen Pharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca and Tizona Therapeutics), regulatory T cell therapies (Targazyme, Inc., Caladrius BioSciences, Inc., and Tract Therapeutics, Inc.), or IL-2 based therapies (Amgen, Inc., BMS (through its acquisition of Delnia, Inc.), GentiBio, Inc., ILTOO Pharma, Kyverna Therapeutics, Merck & Co, through its acquisition of Pandion Therapeutics, and Sanofi SA, through its acquisition of Synthorx, Inc.).
NKTR-255
There are numerous companies engaged in developing immunotherapies with different approaches to enhancing NK cell populations which are a key component of the innate immune system. The approaches include engineered biologics 

targeting the IL-15 pathway as well as autologous and allogenic cell therapy approaches. For NKTR-255, we believe companies that are currently researching and developing engineered IL-15 biologics and cell therapies that could compete with this drug candidate include Artiva Biotherapeutics, Fate Therapeutics, ImmunityBio, Inc., nkarta therapeutics, NKMax America, and Roche/Genentech (through its partnership with Xencor, Inc.).
Research and Development
    Our total research and development expenditures can be disaggregated into the following significant types of expenses (in millions):
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020
Third party and direct materials costs | $ | 176.9 | | | $ | 195.1
Personnel, overhead and other costs | 158.7 | | | 147.2 | 
Stock-based compensation and depreciation | 64.7 | | | 66.4 | 
Research and development expense | $ | 400.3 | | | $ | 408.7

Manufacturing and Supply
    We have a manufacturing facility located in Huntsville, Alabama that manufactures our proprietary PEG reagents for subsequent conjugation to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The facility is also used to produce APIs themselves, as well as PEG conjugates of those APIs, to support the early phases of clinical development of our drug candidates. The facility and associated equipment are designed and operated to be consistent with all applicable laws and regulations. As we do not maintain the capability to manufacture biologics nor finished drug products for our development programs, we primarily utilize contract manufacturers to manufacture biologics and finished drug product for us. We also utilize the services of contract manufacturers to manufacture APIs and finished drug products required for later phases of clinical development and eventual commercialization. Our contract manufacturers have contractual obligations to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
    We source drug starting materials for our manufacturing activities from one or more suppliers. For the drug starting materials necessary for our drug candidate development, we have agreements for the supply of such drug components with drug manufacturers or suppliers that we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. However, from time to time, we source critical raw materials and services from one or a limited number of suppliers and there is a risk that if such supply or services were interrupted, it could materially harm our business. In addition, we typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis for early phase clinical development products and enter into long-term supply arrangements only for late stage products nearing regulatory approval for marketing authorization.
Environment
    As a manufacturer of PEG reagents for the U.S. market, we are subject to inspections by the FDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. To our knowledge, we comply with all material governmental regulations applicable to our business. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had 740 employees, of which 577 employees were engaged in research and development, manufacturing, and quality activities and 163 employees in general administrative and commercial operations function. Of the 740 employees, 661 were located in the U.S. We have a number of employees who hold advanced degrees, such as a Ph.D. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We are committed to attracting, developing, advancing and retaining a diverse and talented workforce. As part of our measures to attract and retain personnel, we offer a total rewards package to our full-time employees consisting of base salary, cash bonuses based on individual and company performance, equity compensation and comprehensive benefits, including health insurance, life insurance, retirement plans, and paid holiday and vacation time. We support our employee’s further development by providing professional development opportunities. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.

    To complement our own expert professional staff, we utilize specialists in clinical development, regulatory affairs, pharmacovigilance, process engineering, manufacturing and quality assurance. These individuals include scientific advisors as well as independent consultants.
