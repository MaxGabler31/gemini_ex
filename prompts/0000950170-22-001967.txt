 Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to realizing the promise of precision medicines for the treatment of cancer. Our pipeline consists of small molecule product candidates that target cancer signaling pathways where there is a strong scientific and clinical rationale to improve outcomes, and we intend to pair them with molecular or cellular diagnostics to identify those patients most likely to respond to treatment. We presently have two clinical-stage product candidates, ziftomenib (ziftomenib is the international nonproprietary name for KO-539) and tipifarnib, one preclinical-stage product candidate, KO-2806, currently in investigational new drug, or IND, -enabling studies, as well as additional programs that are at a discovery stage. We own global commercial rights to all of our programs and product candidates. We plan to advance our product candidates through a combination of internal development and strategic partnerships while maintaining significant development and commercial rights.



Our first product candidate, ziftomenib, is a potent, selective, reversible and oral small molecule inhibitor which blocks the interaction of two proteins, menin and the protein expressed by the Lysine K-specific Methyl Transferase 2A gene, or KMT2A (formerly referred to as the mixed-lineage leukemia 1 gene). We have generated preclinical data that support the potential anti-tumor activity of ziftomenib in genetically defined subsets of acute leukemia, including those with rearrangements or partial tandem duplications in the KMT2A gene as well as those with oncogenic driver mutations in genes such as nucleophosmin 1, or NPM1. Our preclinical data support the hypothesis that ziftomenib targets epigenetic dysregulation and removes a key block to cellular differentiation to drive anti-tumor activity. We believe ziftomenib has the potential to address approximately 35% of acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, including NPM1-mutant AML and KMT2A-rearranged AML. In the pediatric population, KMT2A-rearranged leukemias make up approximately 10% of acute leukemias in all age groups and in the case of infant leukemias, the frequency of KMT2A rearrangements is 70–80%. These pediatric leukemia sub-types portend a poorer prognosis and five-year survival rate that is lower than other leukemia sub-types and therefore represent a significant unmet medical need given the lack of curative therapeutic options.
 We received orphan drug designation for ziftomenib for the treatment of AML from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in July 2019. We initiated our menin-KMT2A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ziftomenib in relapsed or refractory AML which we call the Kura Oncology MEnin-KMT2A Trial, or KOMET-001, in September 2019. The Phase 1a dose escalation portion of the KOMET-001 trial used an accelerated design and the Phase 1b portion of the study seeks to validate a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule, or RP2D.
On December 5, 2020, we announced preliminary results from our KOMET-001 trial at an oral presentation at the 2020 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, or ASH. As of the data cutoff date for the ASH presentation, November 2, 2020, the trial had enrolled 12 patients with relapsed or refractory AML, of whom ten were evaluable for safety and tolerability and eight were evaluable for efficacy. Clinical or biological activity was reported in six of the eight efficacy-evaluable patients, including two patients achieving a complete remission, one patient achieving a morphological leukemia-free state, and one patient experiencing a marked decrease in hydroxyurea requirements and having attained peripheral blood count stabilization. As presented at ASH, ziftomenib has been well tolerated with a manageable safety profile to date. As of the data cutoff date, no drug discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events and no evidence of QTc prolongation were reported. Treatment related adverse effects (grade ³ 3) were reported to include pancreatitis, increased lipase, decreased neutrophil count, tumor lysis syndrome and deep venous thrombosis.
 On May 6, 2021, we reported that we amended the KOMET-001 trial protocol to include two Phase 1b expansion cohorts at doses that cleared the safety threshold in dose escalation. The Phase 1b portion of the study is designed to determine the lowest dose of ziftomenib that provides maximum biologic and clinical effect, consistent with guidance from the FDA relating to targeted oncology therapies, known as Project Optimus.
 On June 24, 2021, we reported that we dosed our first patient in the Phase 1b expansion cohorts. Each cohort – a lower dose (200 mg) and a higher dose (600 mg) – is comprised of NPM1-mutant and KMT2A-rearranged relapsed/refractory AML patients. Both doses demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity and safety and were determined to be well tolerated in the

Phase 1a portion of the study. We expect to enroll 12 evaluable patients in each cohort and assess those patients for safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in order to determine the RP2D. The study protocol gives us the flexibility to enroll up to 30 patients in the selected cohort while we transition into the registration-directed portion of the study. We believe data from all patients treated at the RP2D will contribute to the registrational patient population.
Pending determination of the RP2D, we are preparing to conduct a comprehensive clinical development plan for ziftomenib, aimed at broadening the opportunity to develop treatments for patients with acute leukemias. Additional development opportunities include combination studies, other genetic subtypes, a pediatric development strategy and other indications, such as acute lymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.
 On November 24, 2021, we reported that the FDA had placed the KOMET-001 trial on a partial clinical hold. The partial clinical hold was initiated following our report to the FDA of a Grade 5 serious adverse event potentially associated with differentiation syndrome, a known adverse event related to differentiating agents in the treatment of AML. Patients who were enrolled in the Phase 1b expansion cohorts at the time of the partial clinical hold were permitted to continue to receive ziftomenib, although no additional patients were to be enrolled until the partial clinical hold was lifted. On January 20, 2022, we announced that the FDA had lifted the partial clinical hold on the KOMET-001 trial following agreement on our mitigation strategy for differentiation syndrome, and that the study would resume screening and enrollment of new patients. We anticipate completing enrollment in the Phase 1b expansion cohorts of the KOMET-001 trial in the second quarter of 2022, and identifying the RP2D and reporting top-line data in the third quarter of 2022.
 On December 13, 2021, we reported the presentation of preclinical data for ziftomenib and its potential for synergistic activity in combination with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, a current standard of care in the treatment of patients with AML. These data confirm that treatment with ziftomenib drives dose-dependent induction of growth inhibition, differentiation and loss of viability of AML cells with KMT2A rearrangements or NPM1 mutations, while also reducing key protein levels such as MEIS1, FLT3 and BCL2 and menin itself. In addition, the new findings show that co-treatment with ziftomenib and venetoclax induces synergistic activity in patient-derived AML cells expressing KMT2A rearrangements or NPM1 mutations, with or without mutant FLT3 expression, and prolongs survival in an aggressive disseminated model of KMT2A-rearranged, FLT3-mutant AML.
 Our second product candidate, tipifarnib, is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor of farnesyl transferase that has been previously studied in more than 5,000 cancer patients and demonstrated compelling and durable anti-cancer activity in certain patients with a manageable side effect profile. We are currently evaluating tipifarnib in multiple solid tumor and hematologic indications.
 Our most advanced solid tumor indication for tipifarnib is in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or HNSCC, that carry mutations in the HRAS gene. We are conducting a global, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative registration-directed clinical trial of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant HNSCC designed with two cohorts: a treatment cohort, which we call AIM-HN, and a prospective observational cohort, which we call SEQ-HN.
 In July 2020, we amended the AIM-HN trial protocol to enable enrollment of patients with any HRAS mutation, in addition to patients with a high HRAS variant allele frequency, in order to assess the potential for clinical benefit in the overall HRAS mutant HNSCC population. We also introduced a number of modifications to the protocol that seek to enable us to enroll patients in the study more efficiently as well as modifications that we believe better reflect the evolving standards of care for recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. While these amendments do not change the primary outcome measure of an objective response rate, or ORR, in patients with high HRAS mutant variant allele frequency, the modifications will require us to enroll an increased number of evaluable HNSCC patients. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the additional patients required for the trial, we anticipate we will continue to face delays in our timelines and milestones for the AIM-HN trial and, accordingly, are unable to reasonably forecast at this time when our AIM-HN trial will become fully enrolled.
 On February 24, 2021, we announced that tipifarnib was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HRAS mutant HNSCC with variant allele frequency ≥ 20% after disease progression on platinum-based chemotherapy. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is based upon data from our Phase 2 RUN-HN trial, which was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology on June 10, 2021.
 In addition to evaluating tipifarnib as a monotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic HRAS mutant HNSCC, we have been evaluating the use of tipifarnib in combination with other oncology therapies to address larger patient populations and to pursue earlier lines of therapy. Among these potential combinations, we have prioritized the combination of tipifarnib and an inhibitor of the PI3 kinase alpha enzyme for clinical evaluation in patients with biomarker-defined subsets of HNSCC.

On July 6, 2021, we announced a clinical collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, to evaluate the combination of tipifarnib and alpelisib, a PI3 kinase alpha inhibitor, in patients with HNSCC whose tumors have HRAS overexpression and/or PIK3CA mutation and/or amplification. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we commenced a Phase 1/2 open-label, biomarker-defined cohort study, which we call the KURRENT trial, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination, determine the recommended dose and schedule for the combination, and assess early antitumor activity of the combination for the treatment of such patients. Under the terms of our collaboration agreement with Novartis, we sponsor the KURRENT trial and supply tipifarnib, and Novartis supplies alpelisib. On December 16, 2021, we announced dose administration for the first patient in KURRENT.
 We believe tipifarnib also has potential to drive clinical benefit in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas, or PTCL, including patients with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, or AITL, as well as other subtypes of PTCL. We presented clinical data from our Phase 2 study in patients with relapsed and/or refractory PTCL at the 2021 ASH, demonstrating an overall response rate of 56% and median overall survival of 32.8 months in patients with advanced AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma.
 As previously reported, we are developing a next-generation farnesyl transferase inhibitor which we believe demonstrates improved potency, pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties relative to tipifarnib. In June 2021, we nominated a development candidate, KO-2806, which we have advanced into IND-enabling studies. We intend to direct this development candidate at innovative biology and larger disease indications in combination with other targeted therapies, and we expect to submit an IND for KO-2806 by the end of 2022.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to discover, acquire, develop and commercialize innovative anti-cancer agents in oncology indications with significant unmet medical need and attractive commercial potential. The key components of our strategy include the following:
 •Focus on developing novel, small molecule product candidates for the treatment of cancer;
 •Identify molecular, genetic or other tumor-related characteristics to identify patients more likely to benefit from our product candidates;
 •Leverage clinical and pathology trends towards comprehensive tumor profiling and the use of companion diagnostics;
 •Prioritize development of our clinical-stage programs, ziftomenib and tipifarnib, as well as our earlier discovery-stage programs, such as KO-2806, in clinical indications of high unmet need where improved outcomes are associated with specific biomarkers;
 •Advance our programs through a combination of internal development and strategic partnerships;
 •Maintain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates; and
 •Build a sustainable product pipeline through internal discovery and development efforts as well as through potential external sources including collaborations, in-licensings and acquisitions.
 The COVID-19 Pandemic
 The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions and business interruptions and shutdowns. These precautions may continue to disrupt our business operations and prospects. Since early March 2020, we have taken temporary precautionary measures, including routine screening and remote working initiatives, intended to help minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees and their families. We also suspended non-essential travel worldwide for our employees. In addition, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, patient screening and enrollment at a slower pace at many of our clinical trial sites than what was projected when the trials began. Some of our clinical sites have experienced challenges in conducting trial activities while they focus critical resources on caring for COVID-19 patients and due to facility restrictions, quarantines, travel restrictions, remote work requirements and other precautions. To manage the COVID-19 impact on our business, we developed a comprehensive COVID-19 contingency plan designed to work closely with our third-party contractors and investigators to ensure our ongoing clinical trials proceed safely and efficiently. As a result of these efforts, we continue to accrue patients for our clinical trials, but we expect the disruption caused by and the challenges associated with COVID-19 to continue for the

foreseeable future. The long-term trends impacting our business from COVID-19 are uncertain and will depend on the continued world-wide progress toward managing this health crisis.
 Precision Medicines in Cancer Treatment
 Advancements in cancer genetics and new molecular diagnostic tools are helping define why some patients respond to a specific therapy while other patients receive little to no clinical benefit. This new era in cancer drug discovery and development offers the potential for innovative treatments that are safer and more effective for patients with specific cancers. We aim to improve patient outcomes and contribute to the reduction in healthcare costs by matching targeted therapeutics to the patients who will derive the most benefit. We are developing a pipeline of small molecule product candidates designed to inhibit mutated or abnormally functioning cellular pathways that drive cancer growth or drug resistance and intend to pair them with molecular diagnostics to identify those patients with tumors most likely to respond to treatment. This approach to treatment is known as precision medicine.
 A pioneering example of a precision medicine in cancer was the development of small molecule inhibitors against epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, in patients with advanced lung cancer. Patients with EGFR mutations treated with EGFR inhibitors have a response rate in the 65% range, as opposed to a response rate of approximately 10% in unselected lung patients. Erlotinib (Tarceva®) was approved in the United States as a first-line treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, characterized by EGFR mutations. Other examples of approved agents developed using precision medicine approaches include ALK, BCR-ABL, BRAF, ROS1, RET and TRK inhibitors.
 Precision medicine has several advantages over traditional drug development. We believe evidence-based selection of patients who are more likely to respond to a targeted therapy based on tumor biology provides the potential for: higher translatability from preclinical to clinical studies; increased overall response rates, requiring fewer enrolled patients for clinical development; and expedited clinical development in areas of high unmet need. We believe the precision medicine approach has the potential for more efficient drug development with reduced risks, costs and timelines. However, achieving success through a precision medicine approach is predicated on a thorough understanding of tumor biology and the mechanism of action of the product candidate. To develop this understanding, we have conducted extensive translational research on each of our programs.
 Our Approach to Development of Precision Medicines in Oncology
 Translational research is the practice of synthesizing our knowledge of basic research, preclinical and clinical data to develop a “bench-to-bedside” understanding of the potential of our product candidates, and it is the principal methodology we utilize to guide our precision medicine approach. We evaluate our product candidates through both in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate their potential as therapeutics using a number of tools, including patient-derived xenograft, or PDX, models. PDX models mostly retain the principal histologic and genetic characteristics of their donor tumor and have been shown in many instances to be predictive of clinical outcomes and are increasingly being used for preclinical drug evaluation, biomarker identification, biologic studies and personalized medicine strategies. We evaluate our product candidates in preclinical PDX studies seeking to corroborate clinical data and to identify and prioritize potential clinical indications.
 Because we often target molecular and/or genetic alterations that are detectable, companion diagnostic tests can be developed to identify these alterations. Once we have identified a target, we will initially use existing diagnostic tools, such as next-generation sequencing, or NGS, or RNA expression profiling, to identify patient subsets that we believe will derive increased benefit from our product candidates. As we advance our product candidates clinically and determine the most important screening criteria, we intend to develop companion diagnostics as appropriate, with the help of technology partners, to seek to identify patients, and if our clinical development programs are successful, to support the potential registration and marketing of our product candidates.
 Our clinical development strategy employs a disciplined approach designed to identify response signals early in development and reduce development risks. Based upon the data from our preclinical studies as well as clinical data, we seek to evaluate our product candidates in well-defined patient populations and believe this gives us a higher likelihood of demonstrating a clinical benefit. This approach is intended to allow for early insight into the therapeutic potential of a product candidate and the possibility for rapid clinical development and expedited regulatory strategies.
 We are employing some or all of the steps above across our various programs as we advance our pipeline of targeted therapies. We believe the advantages of such an approach are the potential for higher translatability from preclinical to clinical

studies, the ability to leverage clinical and pathology trends towards comprehensive tumor profiling and the potential for expedited clinical development.
 Clinical Programs and Pipeline
 Ziftomenib (KO-539) – A Selective Inhibitor of the Menin-KMT2A Interaction
 We are developing an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the menin-KMT2A interaction for the treatment of genetically defined subsets of acute leukemias, including AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL. The menin-KMT2A program was licensed from the Regents of The University of Michigan, or the University of Michigan.
Acute leukemias, including those with rearrangements or partial tandem duplications in the KMT2A gene as well as those with oncogenic driver mutations in genes such as NPM1, are characterized by chromosomal translocations of the KMT2A gene that are primarily found in patients with AML and ALL and affect both children and adults. These translocations form oncogenes encoding KMT2A fusion proteins, which play a causative role in the onset, development and progression of KMT2A-r leukemias. KMT2A fusion proteins drive the upregulation of expression of a small set of target genes involved in the malignant transformation of blood cells, however, the fusion protein is critically dependent on binding the oncogenic co-factor menin to function. This implies that the menin-KMT2A interaction represents a valuable target for molecular therapy and supports the development of inhibitors of the menin-KMT2A protein-protein interaction.
 The target genes of the KMT2A fusion proteins are also found to be overexpressed in a broader subset of AMLs characterized by mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2 and a different mutation in the KMT2A gene, known as an KMT2A-partial tandem duplication, or KMT2A-PTD. These mutations also appear to be dependent on the interaction between menin and KMT2A, suggesting that the menin-KMT2A complex is a central node in epigenetic dysregulation driven by distinct oncogenic driver mutations known to be important in AML and other hematologic malignancies.
 We have generated preclinical data that support the potential anti-tumor activity of ziftomenib in genetically defined subsets of acute leukemia, including those with rearrangements or partial tandem duplications in the KMT2A gene as well as those with oncogenic driver mutations in genes such as NPM1. In November 2017, we reported preclinical data at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics showing robust and durable activity in multiple in vivo models of AML characterized by KMT2A-rearrangements or mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1 and IDH2. We have further demonstrated that the inhibition of the menin-KMT2A interaction results in the down-regulation of KMT2A fusion target genes and an upregulation of markers of differentiation.
 In September 2019, we initiated the KOMET-001 trial, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ziftomenib in patients with relapsed or refractory AML to investigate the safety and tolerability of ziftomenib in humans, determine a RP2D, characterize pharmacokinetics of ziftomenib and assess any early evidence of antitumor activity.
 On December 5, 2020, we announced preliminary results from our KOMET-001 trial at an oral presentation at the 2020 ASH. As of the data cutoff date for the ASH presentation, November 2, 2020, the trial had enrolled 12 patients with relapsed or refractory AML, of whom ten were evaluable for safety and tolerability and eight were evaluable for efficacy. Clinical or biological activity was reported in six of the eight efficacy-evaluable patients, including two patients achieving a complete remission, one patient achieving a morphological leukemia-free state, and one patient experiencing a marked decrease in hydroxyurea requirements and having attained peripheral blood count stabilization. As presented at ASH, ziftomenib has been well tolerated with a manageable safety profile to date. As of the data cutoff date, no drug discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events and no evidence of QTc prolongation were reported. Treatment related adverse effects (grade ³ 3) were reported to include pancreatitis, increased lipase, decreased neutrophil count, tumor lysis syndrome and deep venous thrombosis.
 On May 6, 2021, we reported that we amended the KOMET-001 trial protocol to include two Phase 1b expansion cohorts at doses that cleared the safety threshold in dose escalation. The Phase 1b portion of the study is designed to determine the lowest dose of ziftomenib that provides maximum biologic and clinical effect, consistent with guidance from the FDA relating to targeted oncology therapies, known as Project Optimus.
 On June 24, 2021, we reported that we dosed our first patient in the Phase 1b expansion cohorts. Each cohort – a lower dose (200 mg) and a higher dose (600 mg) – is comprised of NPM1-mutant and KMT2A-rearranged relapsed/refractory AML patients. Both doses demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity and safety and were determined to be well tolerated in the Phase 1a portion of the study. We expect to enroll 12 evaluable patients in each cohort and assess those patients for safety and

tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in order to determine the RP2D. The study protocol gives us the flexibility to enroll up to 30 patients in the selected cohort while we transition into the registration-directed portion of the study. We believe data from all patients treated at the RP2D will contribute to the registrational patient population.
Pending determination of the RP2D, we are preparing to conduct a comprehensive clinical development plan for ziftomenib, aimed at broadening the opportunity to develop treatments for patients with acute leukemias. Additional development opportunities include combination studies, other genetic subtypes, a pediatric development strategy and other indications, such as acute lymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.
On November 24, 2021, we reported that the FDA had placed the KOMET-001 trial on a partial clinical hold. The partial clinical hold was initiated following our report to the FDA of a Grade 5 serious adverse event potentially associated with differentiation syndrome, a known adverse event related to differentiating agents in the treatment of AML. Patients who were enrolled in the Phase 1b expansion cohort at the time of the partial clinical hold were permitted to continue to receive ziftomenib, although no additional patients were to be enrolled until the partial clinical hold was lifted. On January 20, 2022, we announced that the FDA had lifted the partial clinical hold on the KOMET-001 trial following agreement on our mitigation strategy for differentiation syndrome, and that the study would resume screening and enrollment of new patients. We anticipate completing enrollment in the Phase 1b expansion cohorts of the KOMET-001 trial in the second quarter of 2022, and identifying the RP2D and reporting top-line data in the third quarter of 2022.
 On December 13, 2021, we reported the presentation of preclinical data for ziftomenib and its potential for synergistic activity in combination with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, a current standard of care in the treatment of patients with AML. These data confirm that treatment with ziftomenib drives dose-dependent induction of growth inhibition, differentiation and loss of viability of AML cells with KMT2A rearrangements or NPM1 mutations, while also reducing key protein levels such as MEIS1, FLT3 and BCL2 and menin itself. In addition, the new findings show that co-treatment with ziftomenib and venetoclax induces synergistic activity in patient-derived AML cells expressing KMT2A rearrangements or NPM1 mutations, with or without mutant FLT3 expression, and prolongs survival in an aggressive disseminated model of KMT2A-rearranged, FLT3-mutant AML.
 Tipifarnib – An Oral Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitor
 Overview
 Tipifarnib is a member of a class of product candidates called farnesyl transferase inhibitors, or FTIs. We in-licensed tipifarnib from Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, or Janssen, an affiliate of Johnson & Johnson, in December 2014. Previously, tipifarnib was studied in more than 5,000 oncology patients in more than 70 clinical trials and was observed to be generally well tolerated with a manageable side effect profile as a single agent. Although tipifarnib has a well-established safety profile and has demonstrated compelling and durable anti-cancer activity in certain patients, its activity has not been sufficient in any prior clinical trial to support marketing approval by the FDA. However, clinical and preclinical data suggest that, in certain selected patient populations, tipifarnib has the potential to provide significant benefit to cancer patients with limited treatment options. We have worldwide rights to tipifarnib in all indications other than virology.
Protein Farnesylation and Tipifarnib
 Tipifarnib is a potent and selective inhibitor of protein farnesylation. Certain cellular proteins must associate with the intracellular membrane to function. One of the mechanisms by which proteins are associated with the inner cell membrane is farnesylation, which modifies the protein by attaching a farnesyl group. Another, related mechanism of attachment of proteins to the membrane is protein geranylgeranylation, which is attachment of a geranylgeranyl group to the protein. Protein farnesylation and protein geranylgeranylation, collectively called protein prenylation, cause intracellular proteins to become anchored to the inside of the cell membrane due to the hydrophobic nature of the farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups.
 The enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of the farnesyl groups to proteins is called farnesyl transferase. Small molecule inhibitors of the farnesyl transferase enzyme have been discovered, and several inhibitors including tipifarnib have been evaluated in human clinical trials. The small molecule inhibitors are commonly referred to as FTIs. Many proteins involved in cellular signaling undergo prenylation because they must be associated with other proteins at the inner cellular membrane of the tumor cell to function properly. Treatment of tumors with FTIs results in the reversal of several hallmarks of cancer, including mitotic arrest, induction of apoptosis, growth inhibition, tissue invasion, sustained angiogenesis and tumor growth, as well as induction of tumor regression in animal models.


Among the hundreds of proteins estimated to be prenylated, some are either exclusively farnesylated or exclusively geranylgeranylated; some are both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated, and others are naturally farnesylated but become geranylgeranylated, when the farnesyl transferase enzyme is inhibited. HRAS is an example of a protein that is exclusively farnesylated while KRAS and NRAS are two proteins that are naturally farnesylated but may become geranylgeranylated upon treatment with FTIs.
 Solid Tumors with HRAS Mutations
 Retrovirus-associated DNA sequences, or RAS, are a family of membrane-associated proteins that are involved in regulating cell division in response to growth factor stimulation. HRAS is a member of the RAS family, which includes the other proto-oncogenes: KRAS and NRAS. Collectively, the three RAS genes constitute one of the most frequently mutated families of oncogenes in human cancers. Although HRAS mutations are less common overall relative to KRAS and NRAS mutations in human cancers, they have a higher prevalence in cancers of the upper digestive tract, skin, thyroid and urinary bladder.
 The HRAS protein is involved in regulating cell division in response to growth factor stimulation. Growth factors act by binding cell surface receptors that span the cell’s plasma membrane. Once activated, receptors stimulate signal transduction events in the cytoplasm, a process by which proteins and second messengers relay signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus and instruct the cell to grow or divide. HRAS is localized in the plasma membrane, and it is an early player in many signal transduction pathways. HRAS acts as a molecular on/off switch – once HRAS is turned “on” it recruits and activates proteins necessary for the propagation of the receptor’s signal. In certain tumors, mutations in HRAS or its upstream regulators cause HRAS to be permanently “on,” resulting in persistent activation of downstream growth and proliferation signals that drive tumor cell growth. FTIs work to prevent the aberrant growth and proliferation of cells that are dependent on these signaling pathways by inhibiting protein farnesylation and subsequent membrane localization of HRAS, thereby switching HRAS “off.” HRAS membrane localization is solely dependent on protein farnesylation, and therefore we believe that tipifarnib has the potential for the treatment of HRAS mutant solid tumors.
 HNSCC is one of a number of different types of cancer that arises from squamous cells. Squamous cells are found in the outer layer of skin and in the mucous membranes, which are the moist tissues that line body cavities such as the airways and intestines. HNSCC develops in the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and throat and is classified by its location. HNSCC is caused by a variety of factors that can alter the DNA in cells. The strongest risk factors for developing this form of cancer are tobacco use, including smoking or using chewing tobacco, and heavy alcohol consumption. In addition, infection with certain strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV, is linked to the development of HNSCC.
 HNSCC is a disease of high unmet need. Response rates for the three approved second-line agents, cetuximab (Erbitux®), nivolumab (Opdivo®) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda®), are in the range of 13-16% in unselected populations, with a median progression-free survival, or PFS, of approximately two months and a median overall survival of fewer than eight months. Data in the literature along with our own clinical data suggest response rates in patients with HRAS mutations may be even lower.
 Other types of cancer that can result from squamous cells include vulvar, penile, cutaneous and lung squamous cell carcinoma. Our preclinical and clinical data suggest that, among solid tumors with HRAS mutations, squamous cell tumors are sensitive tumors to treatment with tipifarnib, and treatment with tipifarnib can, in some patients, produce durable responses.
 Clinical Development of Tipifarnib in HRAS Mutant Solid Tumors
 Proof-of-Concept Trial in HNSCC and other SCCs. We initiated a proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial in May 2015 to test the hypothesis of whether tipifarnib could be used as a treatment for advanced tumors with HRAS mutations. The initiation of this clinical trial was based on our preclinical data, which demonstrated that tipifarnib inhibits HRAS mutant cell proliferation and HRAS tumor growth in mouse models. The clinical trial was originally designed to enroll two cohorts of 18 patients each, with a primary endpoint of ORR and tumor response assessments conducted according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, or RECIST 1.1, criteria with confirmation of response required.
Cohort 1 enrolled patients with malignant thyroid tumors with HRAS mutations, independently of thyroid histology. Ten evaluable patients were enrolled in Stage 1 of Cohort 1. Although evidence of prolonged disease stabilization was observed in several patients, we saw no objective responses within the first stage of the thyroid cohort and the cohort was closed to further enrollment. Cohort 2 was initially designed to enroll any patient with a non-hematological HRAS mutant tumor other than thyroid cancer who met the eligibility criteria. In March 2017, we presented preliminary data from this trial at the 15th International Congress on Targeted Anticancer Therapies, including data from a cohort of three patients with HRAS mutant

HNSCC treated with tipifarnib, two of whom achieved confirmed partial responses, or PRs. Based upon these data, we amended the clinical trial protocol to focus enrollment in Cohort 2 entirely on patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC. In addition, a number of patients with HRAS mutant salivary gland cancer were treated with tipifarnib during the conduct of our Phase 2 clinical trial, several of whom experienced tumor shrinkage and prolonged disease stabilization.
 In September 2017, we reported that our proof-of-concept clinical trial of tipifarnib in patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC achieved its primary efficacy endpoint with four confirmed, partial responses among the first six evaluable HNSCC patients enrolled in the trial. Following achievement of the primary efficacy endpoint in patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC, we further amended the clinical trial protocol to add a third cohort with patients having HRAS mutant SCCs other than HNSCC.
 In October 2018, we reported updated data from our proof-of-concept clinical trial of tipifarnib in patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC and preliminary data in our cohort of other HRAS mutant SCCs at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress. An analysis of available tumor biopsy samples showed a significant association between tumor HRAS mutant allele frequency, or the measurement of mutated HRAS encoding DNA in a patient’s tumor compared to wild type HRAS DNA, and clinical benefit in patients treated with tipifarnib. Of the 14 HNSCC or other SCC patients with a tumor HRAS mutant allele frequency greater than 20%, seven achieved PRs, one achieved an unconfirmed PR and two experienced disease stabilization greater than six months. No meaningful clinical benefit was observed at that time in the seven patients with an allele frequency less than 20%. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas indicate that approximately 5% of HNSCC patients have an HRAS mutant allele frequency greater than 20%.
 Following the data update in October 2018, we modified our ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial of tipifarnib in patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC whose disease had progressed after prior therapy to introduce a cohort of patients with a minimum tumor HRAS mutant allele frequency as an entry criterion and use 600 mg orally twice daily as the starting dose, which we call the RUN-HN study. On May 29, 2020, updated clinical outcome data from the RUN-HN study was presented in an oral session at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Virtual Scientific Program. At data cutoff, 21 patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC were enrolled, of whom 18 were evaluable for efficacy. Nine of the 18 evaluable patients achieved a PR for an ORR of 50% (95% CI, 26.0 to 74.0), with a median duration of response of 14.7 months. Median PFS was 5.9 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 19.2), compared to 2.8 months on the patients’ last prior therapy. Median overall survival was 15.4 months (95% CI, 7.0 to 46.4). Patients had a median of two prior lines of therapy (range 0-6). Robust activity was seen despite resistance to chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or cetuximab. Patients in the RUN-HN trial received tipifarnib at a starting dose of 600 or 900 mg orally twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21 of 28-day cycles. Tipifarnib was generally well-tolerated. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events seen in at least 10% of patients were cytopenia and gastrointestinal disturbances.
 On February 24, 2021, we announced that tipifarnib was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HRAS mutant HNSCC with variant allele frequency ≥ 20% after disease progression on platinum-based chemotherapy. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is based upon data from our Phase 2 RUN-HN trial, which was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology on June 10, 2021.
 Registration-Directed Trial in HRAS Mutant HNSCC. Based on the positive results observed in our proof-of-concept clinical trial, and following feedback from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, we initiated a global, multi-center, open-label, registration-directed clinical trial in recurrent or metastatic patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC in November 2018. The trial has two cohorts: a treatment cohort, which we call AIM-HN, and a prospective observational cohort, which we call SEQ-HN.
 SEQ-HN is designed as a case-control trial to determine the treatment outcomes of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC with HRAS mutations. The primary objective of SEQ-HN is to determine the ORR of first-line therapy in patients with HNSCC that carry HRAS mutations compared to those without a known HRAS mutation. In addition, this screening and outcomes cohort is expected to enable the identification of patients with HRAS mutations for potential enrollment into AIM-HN.
 In July 2020, we amended the AIM-HN trial protocol to enable enrollment of patients with any HRAS mutation, in addition to patients with a high HRAS variant allele frequency, in order to assess the potential for clinical benefit in the overall HRAS mutant HNSCC population. We also introduced a number of modifications to the protocol that seek to enable us to enroll patients in the study more efficiently as well as modifications that we believe better reflect the evolving standards of care for recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. While these amendments do not change the primary outcome measure of an ORR in patients with high HRAS mutant variant allele frequency, the modifications will require us to enroll an increased number of evaluable HNSCC patients. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the additional patients required for the trial, we anticipate we

will continue to face delays in our timelines and milestones for the AIM-HN trial and, accordingly, are unable to reasonably forecast at this time when our AIM-HN trial will become fully enrolled.
 Tipifarnib in Combination with Other Therapies
In addition to evaluating tipifarnib as a monotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic HRAS mutant HNSCC, we have been evaluating the use of tipifarnib in combination with other oncology therapies to address larger patient populations and to pursue earlier lines of therapy. Among these potential combinations, we have prioritized the combination of tipifarnib and an inhibitor of the PI3 kinase alpha enzyme for clinical evaluation in patients with biomarker-defined subsets of HNSCC. On July 6, 2021, we announced a clinical collaboration with Novartis to evaluate the combination of tipifarnib and alpelisib, a PI3 kinase alpha inhibitor, in patients with HNSCC whose tumors have HRAS overexpression and/or PIK3CA mutation and/or amplification. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we commenced a Phase 1/2 open-label, biomarker-defined cohort study, which we call the KURRENT trial, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination, determine the recommended dose and schedule for the combination, and assess early antitumor activity of the combination for the treatment of such patients. Under the terms of our collaboration agreement with Novartis, we sponsor the KURRENT trial and supply tipifarnib, and Novartis supplies alpelisib. On December 16, 2021, we announced dose administration for the first patient in KURRENT.
Investigator-Sponsored Trial in HRAS Mutant Solid Tumors. In addition to our company-sponsored clinical trials in HRAS mutant solid tumors, an investigator-sponsored clinical trial of tipifarnib for the treatment of HRAS mutant lung squamous cell carcinoma is ongoing. This proof-of-concept clinical trial is being conducted by Grupo Español de Cáncer de Pulmón, a Spanish lung cancer consortium, and is designed to enroll at least 18 patients. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is ORR, and secondary endpoints include PFS, duration of response and safety.
 An investigator-sponsored clinical trial of tipifarnib was conducted for the treatment of advanced, previously treated urothelial carcinomas carrying HRAS mutations. This proof-of-concept clinical trial was sponsored by the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, South Korea and enrolled 21 patients. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial was PFS at six months, and secondary endpoints included ORR, duration of response and safety. In 2020, the study was completed and the results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting and published in Clinical Cancer Research. The ORR by intent-to-treat analysis was 24%, median progression-free survival was 4.7 months and overall survival was 6.1 months.
 Companion Diagnostics for Tipifarnib in HRAS Mutant Solid Tumors. Patients are currently being enrolled in the ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept HRAS mutant tumor clinical trial and our AIM-HN clinical trial based either upon information on the patients’ tumor HRAS mutation status obtained by the clinical sites from NGS panels used by the site, or upon information obtained from third-party laboratories who conduct genetic screening on patient samples for the clinical sites. Working with our collaborators, we have obtained an investigational device exemption for use of a qualitative polymerase chain reaction, or qPCR, -based assay as a companion diagnostic test for our AIM-HN clinical trial. We expect that regulatory approval of tipifarnib as a treatment for patients with HRAS mutant tumors will require FDA approval of an HRAS assay in the form of a companion diagnostic test that has been validated for accuracy, precision and reproducibility. On January 4, 2021, we entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Illumina Agreement, with Illumina, Inc., or Illumina. Under the Illumina Agreement, Illumina has agreed to develop and commercialize an assay as a companion diagnostic test to identify head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients with an HRAS mutation for use with tipifarnib. Illumina is also responsible for developing, and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for, the companion diagnostic test in the United States, the United Kingdom and major European markets and such other countries as the parties may mutually agree.
Registration Strategy for Tipifarnib in HRAS Mutant Solid Tumors. Our immediate strategy for tipifarnib in HRAS mutant solid tumors is to generate a data package to support an application for marketing approval in HRAS mutant HNSCC. In July 2021, we announced a clinical collaboration with Novartis to evaluate the combination of tipifarnib and alpelisib, a PI3 kinase alpha inhibitor, in patients with HNSCC whose tumors have HRAS overexpression and/or PIK3CA mutation and/or amplification. We commenced a Phase 1/2 open-label, biomarker-defined cohort study, which we call the KURRENT trial, in the fourth quarter of 2021 to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination, determine the recommended dose and schedule for the combination, and assess early antitumor activity of the combination for the treatment of such patients. We may also seek to broaden tipifarnib’s potential use in other HRAS mutant solid tumors, including HRAS mutant SCCs other than HNSCC, as we believe this may represent further opportunity to expand the use of tipifarnib into a broader set of HRAS mutant cancers. Longer term, our development strategy for tipifarnib is to advance toward earlier lines of therapy and, ultimately, to treat patients with HRAS mutant SCCs in the continuum of systemic treatment settings.


Clinical Development of Tipifarnib in T-Cell Lymphomas
 In addition to its activity against HRAS mutant solid tumors, we have data that supports that tipifarnib inhibits the production of CXCL12, a chemokine that binds to the receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 and regulates a number of key cellular processes associated with cancer including proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and metastasis. Targeting the CXCR4–CXCL12 axis has the potential of affecting CXCR4-expressing primary tumor cells, modulating the immune response, or synergizing with other anticancer therapies. As an example of using tipifarnib to affect CXCR4-expressing primary tumor cells, we have been evaluating the potential utility of tipifarnib in various lymphomas and leukemias.
 CXCL12 has been reported to promote the progression of lymphomas and leukemias carrying the CXCR4 receptor. We had previously identified an association between CXCL12 expression levels and clinical benefit in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL treated with tipifarnib. We presented the final results of our Phase 2 study in patients with relapsed and/or refractory PTCL at the 2021 ASH, demonstrating an overall response rate of 56% and median overall survival of 32.8 months in patients with advanced AITL, an aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma.
 Although we believe this data and other ancillary studies show tipifarnib’s potential to modulate the CXCR4-expressing primary tumor cells in AITL, PTCL and other diseases such as relapsed or refractory AML, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and pancreatic cancer, we have not prioritized further development in these areas.
 Next-Generation Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitor
 We are developing a next-generation farnesyl transferase inhibitor which we believe demonstrates improved potency, pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties relative to tipifarnib. In June 2021, we nominated a development candidate, KO-2806, which we have advanced into IND-enabling studies. We intend to direct this development candidate at innovative biology and larger disease indications in combination with other targeted therapies, and we expect to submit an IND for KO-2806 by the end of 2022.
License Agreements
 The University of Michigan
 In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Michigan, which was amended in March 2015, July 2015, September 2016, February 2017, May 2017 and August 2017, which grants us exclusive worldwide rights under certain patent rights to compounds in our menin-KMT2A program. Under this license agreement, we paid the University of Michigan an upfront nonrefundable license fee and are obligated to pay the University of Michigan annual license maintenance fees. We are also required to make development and regulatory milestone payments to the University of Michigan of up to $3.4 million in the aggregate if specified development and regulatory events are achieved for the first indication and additional payments for each subsequent indication. If we grant sublicenses under the license from the University of Michigan, we are required to pay the University of Michigan a percentage of certain amounts received from the sublicenses. When and if commercial sales of products covered by the licensed patent rights begin, we are obligated to pay the University of Michigan tiered royalties of low single digit percentages of our net sales depending on the amount of our net sales with standard provision for royalty offsets and sales-based milestones. All future development, regulatory and commercial work on the licensed compounds will be completed fully by us and at our sole expense. The University of Michigan retains the right to use the licensed compounds for non-commercial research, internal and/or educational purposes, with the right to grant the same limited rights to other non-profit research institutions. Under the agreement, as a result of our March 2015 private placement, we issued to the University of Michigan 79,113 shares of our common stock at a fair value of $0.5 million. The license agreement with the University of Michigan will terminate upon the last-to-expire patent rights, or may be terminated by us at any time with 90 days written notice of termination or terminated by the University of Michigan upon a bankruptcy by us, payment failure by us that is not cured within 30 days or a material breach of the agreement by us that is not cured within 60 days.
Janssen Pharmaceutica NV
 In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Janssen, which was amended in June 2016, which grants us exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize tipifarnib in all indications other than virology and includes the right to grant sublicenses. We are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tipifarnib and, with the exception of the transfer to us without cost of Janssen’s existing inventory of tipifarnib material, we are responsible for all future development and commercialization costs for tipifarnib. Under the license agreement, Janssen had a first right to negotiate for an exclusive license back from us to develop and commercialize tipifarnib on terms to be negotiated in good faith, which Janssen could exercise during the 60-day period following completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant patients in oncology and delivery by us to Janssen of a complete data package from such clinical trial. In June 2018, Janssen declined to exercise this first right to negotiate.
 Under the terms of the license agreement, in January 2015 we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $1.0 million to Johnson & Johnson Innovation—JJDC, Inc., which automatically converted into shares of common stock in our March 2015 private placement. When and if commercial sales of tipifarnib begin, we are obligated to pay Janssen tiered royalties of low teens percentages of our net sales, depending on the amount of our net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets in the event of generic competition or compulsory licenses, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents covering the licensed product in the field in such country, the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity with respect to such product in such country, and ten years from our first commercial sale. We are also required to make regulatory milestone payments to Janssen of up to $25.0 million in the aggregate, if specified regulatory approvals are achieved for the first indication and additional payments for each subsequent indication if specified regulatory approvals are achieved. In addition, we are required to make sales milestone payments of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate if specified sales thresholds are surpassed. If we grant sublicenses under the license from Janssen, we are required to pay to Janssen a percentage of any upfront, lump-sum or milestone payments received from our sublicensee, subject to certain exclusions for regulatory milestone payments due under the license agreement.
 The license agreement with Janssen will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to Janssen, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the license agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Janssen can terminate the license agreement, resulting in a loss of our licensed rights to tipifarnib.
 Competition
 The development and commercialization of new products to treat cancer is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Although we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
 We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and we will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue approaches to targeting molecular alterations and signaling pathways associated with cancer. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, less costly or possessing better safety profiles than our products, and these competitors may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
 In addition, we will need to develop our product candidates in collaboration with diagnostic companies and will face competition from other companies in establishing these collaborations. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with

them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
 Menin-KMT2A Inhibitor Competition
 Although there are currently no approved drugs targeting the menin-KMT2A interaction, we are aware of other companies engaged in discovery, preclinical or clinical development of menin-KMT2A inhibitors including Syndax, Biomea, Janssen, Sumitomo Dainippon and Daiichi Sankyo. Although there are no targeted therapies approved specifically for the treatment of KMT2A-r or NPM1 leukemias, there are several products in clinical development, including Kronos’ entospletinib, Epizyme’s EPZ-5676 and Rasna Therapeutic’s RASP-301.
 FTI Competition
 Although there are currently no approved drugs targeting farnesyl transferase, we are aware of several compounds that are now or have previously been in clinical development, including Merck’s lonafarnib, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s BMS-214662, Astellas Pharma’s, formerly OSI Pharmaceuticals, CP-609,754, and AstraZeneca’s AZD3409. To our knowledge, there are no ongoing clinical trials evaluating any of these agents for the treatment of cancer. However, the initiation of clinical development of another of these agents in an oncology setting could become competitively significant, and if tipifarnib or our other product candidates do not offer sustainable advantages over competing products, we may not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors.
 Even if we are successful in developing our product candidates, the resulting products would compete with a variety of established drugs in each targeted therapeutic indication. Although there are currently no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of HRAS-mutant solid tumors, there are several therapies approved for the treatment of HNSCC, including Eli Lilly’s/Merck KGaA’s cetuximab (Erbitux®), Bristol Myers Squibb’s nivolumab (Opdivo®) and Merck’s pembrolizumab (Keytruda®), and Sq-NSCLC, including Keytruda, Opdivo, Roche’s atezolizumab (Tencentriq®) and Eli Lilly’s ramucirumab (Cyramza®).
 Commercialization
 We have not yet established a full-scale sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our lead candidates are still in clinical development. We anticipate that we will aim to retain commercial rights in North America for any of our product candidates for which we may in the future receive marketing approvals. We may also seek to retain commercial rights in Europe for any of our product candidates for which we may in the future receive marketing approvals. We currently anticipate that, if and when appropriate, we will seek to access the North American or European oncology markets through a focused, specialized, internal sales force.
 Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused internal commercial team (marketing, analytics, market access and sales) in North America to sell our products. We may also build a focused commercial team in Europe to sell our products. Outside of regions where we maintain commercial rights, we may enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions.
 We also aim to build a commercial team to create and implement strategies for any products that we may in the future bring to market. We anticipate that our goals for any such commercial teams include developing initiatives with respect to market development or commercialization for any approved products.
 We currently expect that any third parties with which we may collaborate in the future on the development of any commercial companion diagnostics for use with our therapeutic products will most likely hold the commercial rights to those diagnostic products.

Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize. All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in synthetic processes from available starting materials. The chemistry does not currently require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
 For all our product candidates, we aim to identify and qualify manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and drug product services prior to submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA.
 We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we or our collaborators may develop.
 Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our product candidates and our core technologies, including novel biomarker and diagnostic discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We expect that we will seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, licensing or filing our own U.S., international and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position, which we generally seek to protect through contractual obligations with third parties.
 We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file or license patent applications directed to our key product candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding composition-of-matter of these product candidates, as well as biomarkers that may be useful in selecting the right patient population for use of any of our product candidates, formulations, processes and methods of using these product candidates in the treatment of various cancers. We own or in-license a patent portfolio including issued U.S. patents and their respective counterparts in a number of foreign jurisdictions, pending U.S. patent applications, pending applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and corresponding pending patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions. We have exclusively licensed from the University of Michigan or co-own multiple families of patent applications pertaining to our menin-KMT2A program. The U.S. PTO has issued the University of Michigan and us patents covering the composition of matter of ziftomenib and certain structurally related compounds, and methods of using the compounds for the treatment of cancers, and we are pursuing additional U.S. and foreign patents for ziftomenib. We have exclusively licensed from Janssen a portfolio of approximately 20 patent families. The in-licensed Janssen composition-of-matter and method-of-use patents expired in the United States and Europe in 2016. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, issued us several patents directed to the method of treatment of HRAS mutant HNSCC with tipifarnib and corresponding patents have been issued in a number of foreign jurisdictions. In July and November 2019, the U.S. PTO issued us patents directed to the treatment of HRAS mutant HNSCC with any farnesyl transferase inhibitor. In addition, in July 2019 and January 2020, the European Patent Office, or EPO, granted us patents directed to the method of treatment of HRAS mutant HNSCC patients with tipifarnib. In January 2021, the EPO granted us a patent directed to the method of treating cetuximab-refractory HRAS mutant HNSCC patients with tipifarnib and to the method of treating cetuximab-refractory HRAS mutant lung SCC patients with tipifarnib. In September 2021, the U.S. PTO issued us a patent directed to the method of treatment of EGFR-inhibitor refractory HRAS mutant HNSCC with tipifarnib. In November 2021 and January 2022, the Chinese Patent Office granted us patents directed to the method of treatment of HRAS mutant HNSCC patients with tipifarnib. The U.S. PTO also issued us patents directed to the method of treatment of AITL with tipifarnib and the method of treatment of CXCL12-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas, or PTCL, or AML with tipifarnib. In October 2019, the U.S. PTO issued us a patent directed to the method of treatment of CXCL12-expressing PTCL or AML with any farnesyl transferase inhibitor. We are pursuing additional U.S. and foreign method of treatment patents using farnesyl transferase inhibitors, particularly using tipifarnib. We have also exclusively licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center a patent family pertaining to a method of use of tipifarnib. We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file for patents in the United States with counterparts in major market countries in Europe and other key markets in the rest of the world.
 In addition to the patent applications that we have filed to date, we plan to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by filing patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment and additional inhibitor compounds of oncology molecular targets and their derivatives. Specifically, we anticipate that we will seek patent protection in the United

States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering the compounds, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds, their intermediates and/or metabolites, the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies and the use of biomarkers for patient selection for these compounds. However, these or other patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents, and any issued patents may cover limited claims that reduce their value and/or may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 In addition to patents, we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third-party.
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 If the NDA holder for the reference drug and/or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
 Non-Patent Exclusivity
 In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of an NDA for a listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon FDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug, except that the FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification. Five-year NCE exclusivity does not block the submission, review or approval of a 505(b)(1) NDA.
 Patent Term Extension
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND application and NDA submission—plus all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term, including the extension may not exceed 14 years from the date of NDA approval.
 For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent

extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. PTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 Government Regulation
 FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Product development is also guided by The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH), a global initiative that brings together regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical industry to discuss scientific and technical aspects of pharmaceutical product development and registration. Regional and country-specific health authorities such as FDA, Europe’s EMA and Japan’s PMDA have adopted the ICH guidance as standards to be used in product development.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not placed the IND on hold within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a specific indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other

confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter clinical trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second clinical trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs to encourage timeliness. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 12 months from submission; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed within eight months from submission. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP—a quality system regulating manufacturing—is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may

request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 If a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may review sections of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-approval compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4, or post-approval clinical trials, to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-approval studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to priority review by the FDA.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 A Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). The FDA may expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. A Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all Fast Track designation features, offers intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program and ensures organizational commitment involving senior management at FDA. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication, assuming the same drug has not already been approved for the indication for which the sponsor is seeking orphan designation. If the same drug has already been approved for the indication for which the sponsor is seeking orphan designation, the sponsor must present a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the FDA discloses the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use.
 Orphan designation may provide manufacturers with benefits such as research grants, tax credits, Prescription Drug User Fee Act application fee waivers, and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar

approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety or is shown to provide a major contribution to patient care or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity.
 In the European Union, orphan designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and a grant of ten years of market exclusivity following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Orphan designation must be requested prior to submission of an application for marketing approval. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. An Orphan Drug designation does not obviate, in certain circumstances, the need to evaluate a product in pediatric patients.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the drug’s FDA approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-approval testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.


FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 Our drug products may rely upon in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our cancer therapeutics. If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product in order to allow for its commercial use. This policy is described in an August 2014 FDA guidance document.
 Laboratory Developed Tests which are regulated via the Department of Health and Human Services, specifically the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments regulations and the Food and Drug Administration under the Public Health Service Act have been accepted, to date. for the conduct of clinical trials. The FDA has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain a premarket approval, or PMA, for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the drug. The FDA has indicated that it will require PMA approval of one or more in vitro companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for our cancer therapies. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our cancer treatments involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, denial of submissions for new products or withdrawal of PMA approvals.
 Clinical Trials and IDEs
 A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application. In some cases, one or more smaller IDE studies may precede a pivotal clinical trial intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational device.
 All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients pursuant to FDA regulations, the FDA must approve an IDE application prior to initiation of investigational use. For a clinical trial where the IVD result directs the therapeutic care of

patients with cancer, we believe that the FDA may consider use of the IVD as part of the clinical investigation to present significant risk and require an IDE application.
 An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients. A non-significant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE. Both significant risk and non-significant risk investigational devices require approval from IRBs at the trial centers where the device will be used.
 During the clinical trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, clinical trial monitoring, reporting and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and trial protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and record keeping requirements. Prior to granting PMA approval, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the trial and the clinical data supporting the PMA application for compliance with applicable requirements.
 Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the QSR requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies based on regulations enacted by regional entities such as the European Medicines Agency as well as country-specific health authorities such as Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
 There are also foreign regulations governing the privacy and security of health information and the use of personal data to sell or market products, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR, which imposes privacy and security obligations on any entity that collects and/or processes personal data from individuals located in the European Union and/or sells or markets products in the European Union. Under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global turnover of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed for significant non-compliance.
 Additional Healthcare Regulations and Environmental Matters
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, we are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These laws include transparency laws, anti-kickback statutes, false claims, health information privacy and security statutes and regulation regarding providing drug samples, among others.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs.
Federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set

Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information used and disclosed by covered entities and their business associates that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity, as well as their covered subcontractors. Many states and foreign jurisdictions also have laws and regulations that govern the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, and such laws often vary from one another and from HIPAA.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals. It also requires certain manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to track and report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or drug pricing. Certain state and local laws also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Our activities may also subject to be certain state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information that may not be preempted by HIPAA.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant administrative, criminal and civil penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 In addition to regulatory schemes that apply, or may in the future apply, to our business, we are or may become subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, laboratory procedures and any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research and development activities. We do not presently expect such environmental, health and safety laws or regulations to materially impact our present or planned future activities.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any of our product candidates that may be approved, including any drug or companion diagnostics we may develop, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the cost of the product will be covered by third-party payors. Third-party payors may limit coverage to an approved list of products, or formulary, which might not include all drug products approved by the FDA for an indication. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure

that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Any companion diagnostic that we or our collaborators develop will be subject to separate coverage and reimbursement determinations by third-party payors.
 Any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective by third-party payors, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in the future to demonstrate the medical necessity and/or cost effectiveness of any such product. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown increased interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Continued interest in and adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates we are developing.
 Health Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a specific focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Moreover, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.
 Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner by which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration’s proposals. The FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published

a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. Additionally, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2031, except for a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, Congress is considering additional health reform measures. Further, Congress is considering additional health reform measures. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
