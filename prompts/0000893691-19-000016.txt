Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading global designer, manufacturer and distributor of interior and exterior doors for the new construction and repair, renovation and remodeling sectors of the residential and non-residential building construction markets. Since 1925, we have provided our customers with innovative products and superior service at compelling values. In order to better serve our customers and create sustainable competitive advantages, we focus on developing innovative products, advanced manufacturing capabilities and technology-driven sales and service solutions. Today, we believe we hold either the number one or two market positions in the seven product categories we target in North America: interior molded residential doors; interior stile and rail residential doors; exterior fiberglass residential doors; exterior steel residential doors; interior architectural wood doors; wood veneers and molded door facings; and door core.
We market and sell our products to remodeling contractors, builders, homeowners, retailers, dealers, lumberyards, commercial and general contractors and architects through well-established wholesale and retail distribution channels. Our broad portfolio of brands, including Masonite®, Premdor®, Masonite ArchitecturalTM, Marshfield-AlgomaTM, Mohawk®, Megantic®, Solidor®, Residor®, Nicedor®, Door-Stop InternationalTM, Harring DoorsTM, National HickmanTM and Graham-MaimanTM are among the most recognized in the door industry and are associated with innovation, quality and value. In the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, we sold approximately 34 million doors to approximately 9,000 customers in 64 countries. Our fiscal year 2018 net sales by segment and global net sales of doors by end market are set forth below:
Net Salesby Segment - 2018 | Global Net Sales of Doorsby End Market - 2018

See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our segments.
Over the past several years, we have invested in advanced technologies to increase the automation of our manufacturing processes, increase quality and shorten lead times and introduced targeted e-commerce and other marketing initiatives to improve our sales and marketing efforts and customer experience. In addition, we implemented a disciplined acquisition strategy that solidified our presence in the United Kingdom's interior and exterior residential door industry, the North American residential molded and stile and rail interior door industry and created leadership positions in the attractive North American commercial and architectural interior wood door, door core and wood veneer industry.
We operate 71 manufacturing and distribution facilities in 8 countries in North America, Europe, South America and Asia, which are strategically located to serve our customers. We are one of the few vertically integrated door manufacturers in the world and one of only two in the North American residential molded interior door industry as well as the only vertically integrated door manufacturer in the North American architectural interior wood door industry. Our vertical integration extends to all steps of the production process from initial design, development and production 
of steel press plates to produce interior molded and exterior fiberglass door facings to the manufacturing of door components, such as door cores, wood veneers and molded facings, to door slab assembly. We also offer incremental value by pre-machining doors for hardware, hanging doors in frames with glass and hardware and pre-finishing doors with paint or stain. We believe that our vertical integration and automation enhance our ability to develop new and proprietary products, provide greater value and improved customer service and create high barriers to entry. We also believe vertical integration enhances our ability to cut costs, although our cost structure is subject to certain factors beyond our control, such as global commodity shocks.
Product Lines
Residential Doors
We sell an extensive range of interior and exterior doors in a wide array of designs, materials and sizes. While substantially all interior doors are made with wood and related materials such as hardboard (including wood composite molded and flat door facings), the use of wood in exterior doors in North America and Europe has declined over the last two decades as a result of the increased penetration of steel and fiberglass doors. Our exterior doors are made primarily of steel or fiberglass. Our residential doors are molded panel, flush, stile and rail, routed medium-density fiberboard (“MDF”), steel or fiberglass. 
Molded panel doors are interior doors available either with a hollow or solid core and are made by assembling two molded door skin panels around a wood or MDF frame. Molded panel doors are routinely used for closets, bedrooms, bathrooms and hallways. Our molded panel product line is subdivided into several distinct product groups: our original Molded Panel series is a combination of classic styling, period and architectural style-specific designs, durable construction and variety of profiles preferred by our customers when price sensitivity is a critical component in the product selection; the West EndTM Collection strengthens our tradition of design innovation by introducing the clean and simple aesthetics found in modern linear designs to the molded panel interior door category; and the Heritage® Series, which features recessed, flat panels and sharp, Shaker-style profiles which speak to a clean, modern aesthetic while retaining comfortable familiarity found in today’s interiors. All of our molded panel doors can be upgraded with our proprietary, wheat straw based Safe ‘N Sound® door core or our environmentally friendly EmeraldTM door construction which enables home owners, builders and architects to meet specific product requirements and “green” specifications to attain LEED certification for a building or dwelling.
Flush interior doors are available either with a hollow or solid core and are made by assembling two facings of plywood, MDF, composite wood or hardboard over a wood or MDF frame. These doors can either have a wood veneer surface suitable for paint or staining or a composite wood surface suitable for paint. Our flush doors range from base residential flush doors consisting of unfinished composite wood to the ultra high-end exotic wood veneer doors.
Stile and rail doors are made from wood or MDF with individual vertical stiles, horizontal rails and panels, which have been cut, milled, veneered and assembled from lumber such as clear pine, knotty pine, oak and cherry. Within our stile and rail line, glass panels can be inserted to create what is commonly referred to as a French door and we have over 50 glass designs for use in making French doors. Where horizontal slats are inserted between the stiles and rails, the resulting door is referred to as a louver door. For interior purposes, stile and rail doors are primarily used for hallways, room dividers, closets and bathrooms. For exterior purposes, these doors are used as entry doors with decorative glass inserts (known as lites) often inserted into these doors.
Routed MDF doors are produced by using a computer controlled router carver to machine a single piece of double refined MDF. Our routed MDF door category is comprised of two distinct product lines known as the Bolection® and CymaTM door. The offering of designs in this category is extensive, as the manufacturing of routed MDF doors is based on a routing program where the milling machine selectively removes material to reveal the final design.
Steel doors are exterior doors made by assembling two interlocking steel facings (paneled or flat) or attaching two steel facings to a wood or steel frame and injecting the core with polyurethane insulation. With our functional Utility Steel series, the design centric High Definition family and the prefinished Sta-Tru® HD, we offer customers the freedom to select the right combination of design, protection and compliance required for essentially any paint grade exterior door application. In addition, our product offering is significantly increased through our variety of compatible clear or decorative glass designs.
Fiberglass doors are considered premier exterior doors and are made by assembling two fiberglass door facings to a wood frame or composite material and injecting the core with polyurethane insulation. Led by the Barrington® door, our fiberglass door lines offer innovative designs, construction and finishes. The Barrington® family of doors is specifically designed to replicate the construction, look and feel of a real wood door. The Door-StopTM branded fiberglass doors are manufactured into prehung door sets and shipped to our customers with industry-leading lead times. We believe that our patented panel designs, sophisticated wood grain texturing and multiple application-specific construction processes will help our Barrington® and Belleville® fiberglass lines retain a distinct role in the exterior product category in the future.
Architectural Doors
Architectural doors are typically highly specified products designed, constructed and tested to ensure that regulatory compliance and environmental certifications such as FSC and LEED certifications are met. These doors are sold into high-end architectural verticals (schools, healthcare and government facilities) and commercial verticals (hotels, offices, commercial/retail and industrial facilities). We believe that the architectural door industry is shifting focus from transactional, component sales to selling total opening solutions in key performance areas such as fire, security, acoustics and technology. Our two primary product series for the architectural business, AspiroTM and CenduraTM, are comprised of four product categories: stile and rail, flush wood veneer, painted and laminate doors. The Aspiro series offers high-end aesthetic and performance qualities, and its doors are available in exotic and domestic veneers, with acoustic, fire-rated and lead- and bullet-resistant options and include lifetime warranties. The Cendura series provides a balance of performance and value and its doors are available with domestic veneers, with acoustic and fire-rated options and include limited warranties. These product offerings provide general contractors and influencers more of a singular source for the total opening.
Components
In addition to residential and architectural doors, we also sell several door components to the building materials industry. Within the residential new construction market, we provide interior door facings, agri-fiber and particleboard door cores, MDF and wood cut-stock components to multiple manufacturers. Within the architectural building construction market, we are a leading component supplier of various critical door components and the largest wood veneer door skin supplier. Additionally, we are one of the leading providers of mineral and particleboard door cores to the North American architectural door industry.
Molded door facings are thin sheets of molded hardboard produced by grinding or defibrating wood chips, adding resin and other ingredients, creating a thick fibrous mat composed of dry wood fibers and pressing the mat between two steel press plates to form a molded sheet, the surface of which may be smooth or may contain a wood grain pattern. Following pressing, molded door facings are trimmed, primed and shipped to door manufacturing plants where they are mounted on frames to produce molded doors.
Door framing materials, commonly referred to as cut stock, are wood or MDF components that constitute the frame on which interior and exterior door facings are attached. Door cores are pressed fiber mats of refined wood chips or agri-fiber used in the construction of solid core doors. For doors that must achieve a fire rating higher than 45 minutes, the door core consists of an inert mineral core or inorganic intumescent compounds.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing efforts are focused around several key initiatives designed to drive organic growth, influence the mix sold and strengthen our customer relationships.
Multi-Level/Segment Distribution Strategy
We market our products through and to wholesale distributors, retail stores, independent and pro dealers, builders, remodelers, architects, door and hardware distributors and general contractors.
In the residential market, we deploy an "All Products" cross merchandising strategy, which provides certain of our retail and wholesale customers with access to our entire product range. Our "All Products" customers benefit from consolidating their purchases, leveraging our branding, marketing and selling strategies and improving their ability to influence the mix of products sold to generate greater value. We service our big box retail customers directly from our own door fabrication facilities which provide value added services and logistics, including store direct delivery of doors and entry systems and a full complement of in-store merchandising, displays and field service. Our wholesale 
residential channel customers are managed by our own sales professionals who focus on down channel initiatives designed to ensure our products are "pulled" through our North American wholesale distribution network.
Our architectural building construction customers are serviced by a separate and distinct sales team providing architects, door and hardware distributors, general contractors and project owners a wide variety of technical specifications, specific brand differentiation, compliance and regulatory approvals, product application advice and multisegment specialization work across North America. Additionally, our sales team is supported by marketing strategies aimed to drive product specification throughout our value chains via distributors, architects and end users.
Service Innovation
We leverage our marketing, sales and customer service activities to ensure our products are strategically pulled through our multiple distribution channels rather than deploying a more common, tactical "push" strategy like some of our competitors. Our marketing approach is designed to increase the value of each and every door opening we fill with our doors and entry systems, regardless of the channel being used to access our products.
Our proprietary web based tools accessible on our website also provide our customers with a direct link to our information systems to allow for accelerated and easier access to a wide variety of information and selling aids designed to increase customer satisfaction. Within our North American Residential business, our web-based tools include MConnect®, an online service allowing our customers access to several other E-Commerce tools designed to enhance the manufacturer-customer relationship. Once connected to our system, customers have access to MAX®, Masonite’s Xpress Configurator®, a web based tool created to design customized door systems and influence the mix, improve selection and ordering processes, reduce order entry and quoting errors, and improve overall communication throughout the channel; the Product Corner, a section advising customers of the features and benefits of our newest products; Market Intelligence Section, which provides some of the latest economic statistics influencing our industry; and Order Tracker, which allows customers to follow their purchase orders through the production process and confirm delivery dates. MConnect®, in conjunction with our website, improves transaction execution, enhances communication and information flow with our customers and their dealers providing a more customized buying experience.
In Europe, our Solidor and Door-Stop International websites are fully functional configuration and order platforms that support our entry door customers in the United Kingdom. The dynamic integration of Solidor's and Door-Stop's ERPs and their websites ensures that the products customers see, configure and order are in stock, which ensures that we are able to deliver on our promise of dependability.
In our Architectural business, we launched our new door configurator, DoorBuilderTM Live, for mill direct customers that makes selecting and ordering the right door easier and more intuitive. DoorBuilderTM Live is a cloud-based software that streamlines the door ordering process for fast, accurate results. We continue to leverage and promote our quick ship dedicated configurator through our USA Wood Door website, which allows customers to make, retain and track quotes all within the USA Wood Door application. Additionally, we have developed the new DoorSelector tool designed to educate architects to help them select the right products for the opening based on aesthetic and performance attributes.
Customers
During fiscal year 2018, we sold our products worldwide to approximately 9,000 customers. We have developed strong relationships with these customers through our "All Products" cross merchandising strategy. Our vertical integration facilitates our "All Products" strategy with our door fabrication facilities in particular providing value-added fabrication and logistical services to our customers, including store delivery of pre-hung interior and exterior doors to our customers in North America. All of our top 20 customers have purchased doors from us for at least 10 years.
Although we have a large number of customers worldwide, our largest customer, The Home Depot, accounted for approximately 18% of our total net sales in fiscal year 2018. Due to the depth and breadth of the relationship with this customer, which operates in multiple North American geographic regions and which sells a variety of our products, our management believes that this relationship is likely to continue.
Distribution
Residential doors are primarily sold through wholesale and retail distribution channels.

• | Wholesale. In the wholesale channel, door manufacturers sell their products to homebuilders, contractors, lumber yards, dealers and building products retailers in two-steps or one step. Two-step distributors typically purchase doors from manufacturers in bulk and customize them by installing windows, or "lites", and pre-hanging them. One-step distributors sell doors directly to homebuilders and remodeling contractors who install the doors.


• | Retail. The retail channel generally targets consumers and smaller remodeling contractors who purchase doors through retail home centers and smaller specialty retailers. Retail home centers offer large, warehouse size retail space with large selections, while specialty retailers are niche players that focus on certain styles and types of doors.

Architectural doors are primarily sold through specialized one-step wholesale distribution channels where distributors sell to contractors and installers.
Research and Development
We believe we are a leader in technological innovation and development of doors, door components and door entry systems and the manufacturing processes involved in making such products. We believe that research and development is a competitive advantage for us, and we intend to capitalize on our leadership in this area through the development of more new and innovative products. Our research and development and engineering capabilities enable us to develop and implement product and manufacturing process improvements that enable new features, enhance the manufacturing efficiency of our products, improve quality and reduce costs. In the past few years, our research and development activities have had a significant focus on the development of new, differentiated products, while continuing to focus on process and material improvements for our products. Further, we have directed our design innovation to address the growing need for safety and security, sound-dampening and fire-resistant products in the architectural wood door market. 
As an integrated manufacturer, we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the growing global demand for a variety of molded door facing designs. We have an internal capability to create new molded door facing designs and manufacture our own molds for use in our own facilities. We believe this provides us with the ability to develop proprietary designs that enjoy a strong identity in the marketplace; more flexibility in meeting customer demand; quicker reaction time in the production of new designs or design changes; and greater responsiveness to customer needs. This capability also enables us to develop and implement product and process improvements with respect to the production of molded door facings and doors which enhance production efficiency and reduce costs.
Manufacturing Process
Our Manufacturing operations consist of three major manufacturing processes: (1) component manufacturing, (2) door slab assembly and (3) value-added ready to install door fabrication.
We have a leading position in the manufacturing of door components, including internal framing components (stile and rails), glass inserts (lites), door core, interior door facings (molded and veneer) and exterior door facings. The manufacturing of interior molded door facings is the most complex of these processes requiring a significant investment in large scale wood fiber processing equipment. Interior molded door facings are produced by combining fine wood particles, synthetic resins and other additives under heat and pressure in large multi-opening automated presses utilizing Masonite proprietary steel plates. The facings are then primed, cut and inspected in a second highly automated continuous operation prior to being packed for shipping to our door assembly plants. We operate five interior molded door facing plants around the world, two in North America and one in each of South America, Europe and Asia. Our sole United States based plant in Laurel, Mississippi, is one of the largest door facing plants in the world and we believe one of the most technologically advanced in the industry.
Interior residential hollow and solid core door manufacturing is an assembly operation that is primarily accomplished in the United States through the use of semi-skilled manual labor. The construction process for a standard flush or molded interior door is based on assembly of door facings and various internal framing and support components, followed by the doors being trimmed to their final specifications.
The assembly process varies by type of door, from a relatively simple process for flush and molded doors, where the door facings are glued to a wood frame, to more complex processes where many pieces of solid and engineered wood are converted to louver or stile and rail door slabs. Architectural interior doors require another level of customization and sophistication employing the use of solid cores with varying degrees of sound dampening and fire retarding attributes, furniture quality wood veneer facings, as well as secondary machining operations to incorporate more sophisticated commercial hardware, openers and locks. Additionally, architectural doors are typically pre-finished prior to sale.
The manufacturing of steel and fiberglass exterior door slabs is a semi-automated process that entails combining laminated wood or rot free composite framing components between two door facings and then injecting the resulting hollow core structure with insulating polyurethane expanding foam core materials. We invested in fiberglass manufacturing technology, including the vertical integration of our own fiberglass sheet molding compound plant at our Laurel, Mississippi, facility in 2006. In 2008, we consolidated fiberglass slab manufacturing from multiple locations throughout North America into a single highly automated facility in Dickson, Tennessee, significantly improving the reliability and quality of these products while simultaneously lowering cost and reducing lead times.
Short set-up times, proper production scheduling and coordinated material movement are essential to achieve a flexible process capable of producing a wide range of door types, sizes, materials and styles. We make use of our vertically integrated and flexible manufacturing operations together with scalable logistics primarily through the use of common carriers to fill customers’ orders and to minimize our investment in finished goods inventory.
Finally, interior flush and molded, stile and rail, louver and exterior door slabs manufactured at our door assembly plants are either sold directly to our customers or transferred to our door fabrication facilities where value added services are performed. These value added services include machining doors for hinges and locksets, installing the door slabs into ready to install frames, installing hardware, adding glass inserts and side lites, painting and staining, packaging and logistical services to our customers.
Within our manufacturing processes, we leverage the Mvantage operating system to systemically focus on the elimination of waste and non-value-added activities within the organization. In 2018, we focused on driving operational improvement to a new level using our three pronged Mvantage strategy which includes the Model Plant Transformation Process, Process Improvement Teams and the focus on global standards and training. Our Model Plant Transformation Process aims to allow the seamless flow of material through our facilities. Our Process Improvements Teams work closely with manufacturing sites to utilize our Mvantage lean toolbox to diagnose operational inefficiencies and apply corrective actions to stabilize and standardize our day-to-day operations. Our focus on training and implementing global standards has allowed us to drive continuous improvement through an increased numbers of Kaizen events that are being led by our trained facilitators. Through this structured approach, we realized improvements in certain key performance indicators in 2018.
Raw Materials
While Masonite is vertically integrated, we require a regular supply of raw materials, such as wood chips, some cut stock components, various composites, steel, glass, paint, stain and primer as well as petroleum-based products such as binders, resins and plastic injection frames to manufacture and assemble our products. Our materials cost accounts for approximately 53% of the total cost of the finished product. In certain instances, we depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for these supplies. Wood chips, logs, resins, binders and other additives utilized in the manufacturing of interior molded facings, exterior fiberglass door facings and door cores are purchased from global, regional and local suppliers taking into consideration the relative freight cost of these materials. Internal framing components, MDF, cut stock and internal door cores are manufactured internally at our facilities and supplemented from suppliers located throughout the world. We utilize a network of suppliers based in North America, Europe, South America and Asia to purchase other components including steel coils for the stamping of steel door facings, MDF, plywood and hardboard facings, door jambs and frames and glass frames and inserts.
Safety
We believe that safety is as important to our success as productivity and quality. This is reflected in our goal of Target Zero and our continued effort to create an injury-free workplace. We also believe that incidents can be prevented through proper management, employee involvement, standardized operations and equipment and attention to detail. Safety programs and training are provided throughout the company to ensure employees and managers have effective tools to help identify and address both unsafe conditions and at-risk behaviors. 
Through a sustained commitment to improve our safety performance, we have been successful in reducing the number of injuries sustained by our employees over the long term. In 2018 we experienced an increase in the total incident rate, or the annual number of injuries per 100 full time equivalent employees, of 2.1 compared to 1.5 in 2017. In response to this increase, we initiated a new approach to risk identification and management in our plants in the second half of 2018.
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
We strive to minimize any adverse environmental impact our operations might have to our employees, the general public and the communities of which we are a part. We are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. The geographic breadth of our facilities subjects us to environmental laws, regulations and guidelines in a number of jurisdictions, including, among others, the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, the Czech Republic, Chile and Malaysia. Such laws, regulations and guidelines relate to, among other things, the discharge of contaminants into water and air and onto land, the storage and handling of certain regulated materials used in the manufacturing process, waste minimization, the disposal of wastes and the remediation of contaminated sites. Many of our products are also subject to various regulations such as building and construction codes, product safety regulations, health and safety laws and regulations and mandates related to energy efficiency.
Our efforts to ensure environmental compliance include the review of our operations on an ongoing basis utilizing in-house staff and on a selective basis by specialized environmental consultants. The Environmental, Health and Safety team participates in industry groups to monitor developing regulatory actions and actively develop comments on specific issues. Furthermore, for our prospective acquisition targets, environmental assessments are conducted as part of our due diligence review process. Based on recent experience and current projections, environmental protection requirements and liabilities are not expected to have a material effect on our business, capital expenditures, operations or financial position.
In addition to the various environmental laws and regulations, our operations are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to the presence of hazardous materials and protection of worker health and safety, consumer protection, trade, labor and employment, tax, and others. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing applicable laws and regulations affecting our operations.

Competition
The North American door industry is highly competitive and includes a number of global and local participants. In the North American residential interior door industry, the primary participants are Masonite and JELD-WEN, which are the only vertically integrated manufacturers of molded door facings. There are also a number of smaller competitors in the residential interior door industry that primarily source door facings from third party suppliers. In the North American residential exterior door industry, the primary participants are Masonite, JELD-WEN, Plastpro, Therma-Tru, Feather River and Novatech. In the North American non-residential building construction door industry, 
the primary participants are Masonite and VT Industries. Our primary market in Europe is the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom door industry is similarly competitive, including a number of global and local participants. The primary participants in the United Kingdom are our subsidiary Premdor, JELD-WEN, Vicaima and Distinction Doors. Competition in these markets is primarily based on product quality, design characteristics, brand awareness, service ability, distribution capabilities and value. We also face competition in the other countries in which we operate. In Europe, South America and Asia, we face significant competition from a number of regionally based competitors and importers.
A large portion of our products are sold through large home centers and other large retailers. The consolidation of our customers and our reliance on fewer larger customers has increased the competitive pressures as some of our largest customers, such as The Home Depot, perform periodic product line reviews to assess their product offerings and suppliers.
We are one of the largest manufacturers of molded door facings in the world. The rest of the industry consists of one other large, integrated door manufacturer and a number of smaller regional manufacturers. Competition in the molded door facing business is based on quality, price, product design, logistics and customer service. We produce molded door facings to meet our own requirements and outside of North America we serve as an important supplier to the door industry at large. We manufacture molded door facings at our facilities in Mississippi, Ireland, Chile, Canada and Malaysia.
Employees
As of December 30, 2018, we employed approximately 10,000 employees and contract personnel. This includes approximately 2,300 unionized employees, approximately 70% of whom are located in North America with the remainder in various foreign locations. Nine of our North American facilities have individual collective bargaining agreements, which are negotiated locally and the terms of which vary by location. 
History and Reporting Status
Masonite was founded in 1925 in Laurel, Mississippi, by William H. Mason, to utilize vastly available quantities of sawmill waste to manufacture a usable end product. Masonite was acquired by Premdor from International Paper Company in August 2001.
Prior to 2005, Masonite was a public company with shares of our predecessor’s common stock listed on both the New York and Toronto Stock Exchanges. In March 2005, we were acquired by an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P.
