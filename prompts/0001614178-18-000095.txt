Item 1. Business
Overview
Yext is a knowledge engine. Our platform lets businesses control their digital knowledge in the cloud and sync it to our PowerListings Network of approximately 150 service and application providers including Apple Maps, Bing, Cortana, Facebook, Google, Google Assistant, Google Maps, Siri and Yelp. Digital knowledge is the structured information that a business wants to make publicly accessible. For example, in food service, the address, phone number or menu details of a restaurant; in healthcare, the health insurances accepted by a physician or the precise drop‑off point of the emergency room at a hospital campus; or in finance, the ATM locations, retail bank holiday hours or insurance agent biographies. We believe a business is the ultimate authority on its own digital knowledge, and it is our mission to put that business in control of it, everywhere.
Intelligent search, which are searches of digital knowledge that combine context and intent, has grown significantly in recent years. Unlike traditional web-based search where many results are displayed as a list requiring further exploration, web and mobile applications and voice and artificial intelligence, or AI, engines are increasingly answering questions directly and in certain cases providing only one answer. As intelligent search grows, and increasingly leverages AI, consumers are more likely to rely on these direct answers, rather than clicking through to a business's website to find information about a company. The source of the results for intelligent searches is not a web page - it is structured data. Businesses and service providers want their digital knowledge to be accurate, compelling and more prominent than that of their competitors when consumers look for them on search platforms, mobile applications, voice assistants, social media, connected devices and other digital sources. Our solution drives commerce by providing updated digital knowledge that allows consumers to find the businesses and service providers that are most relevant to them.
The vast majority of digital knowledge provided by searches currently comes from third‑party sources such as data aggregators, governmental agencies and consumers. The net result of this third‑party sourcing has been to produce “best guess” data that can often miss or misstate the true digital knowledge for businesses worldwide. We pioneered a better way to source critical digital knowledge. We have built our business on the fundamental premise that the best source of accurate and timely digital knowledge about a business is the business itself. We have established direct data integrations with applications in our PowerListings Network that end consumers around the globe use to discover new businesses, read reviews and find accurate answers to their queries. Our platform ensures that our customers’ digital knowledge is available, accurate and consistent across our PowerListings Network. Businesses can directly control their own digital knowledge rather than leaving it in the hands of third parties, thereby making our platform the system of record for such vital knowledge.
We are increasingly using the structured data on our platform to expand or add new integrations with vertically specialized applications, voice‑based search and AI engines. Our provision of structured digital knowledge, directly produced and managed by businesses and professional service providers themselves, helps ensure the accuracy of search results whether they are presented in traditional search results, an information card or an answer from a digital assistant.
The Yext Knowledge Engine is the core of our platform and enables businesses and professional service providers of all sizes to:

• | modify, enhance and control digital knowledge attributes for each of their locations, professionals, menus or other entities managed with our platform;


• | update once and disseminate changes to their listings across the most widely used third‑party maps, apps, search engines, intelligent GPS systems, digital assistants, vertical directories and social networks that consumers rely upon today;


• | create and update search‑optimized local pages;


• | encourage consumer reviews for inclusion on their local pages; and


• | analyze how listings, pages and reviews are driving consumer engagement.

We offer our cloud‑based Knowledge Engine platform to customers on a subscription basis in several packages. Each package provides varying levels of access to our key features, including Listings, Pages and Reviews. Our Listings feature provides customers with control over the digital presence of their location and other related attributes published on the most widely used third‑party applications. Our Pages feature gives our customers the ability to create individual web pages for their business, enabling control over the image and efficacy of their digital appearance on their own sites. Our Reviews feature enables customers to encourage and facilitate reviews, thereby increasing the quantity and quality of the reviews available to potential consumers and improving the search relevance for their businesses on our PowerListings Network. Ultimately, these and our other features and solutions help ensure that the critical digital knowledge created by businesses and professional service providers and delivered to the consumer is accurate, consistent, up to date and compelling.
Businesses and professional service providers of nearly all sizes and in a diverse set of industries, such as healthcare, retail and financial services, can benefit from our platform and capabilities. Today, our customers use our platform to control digital knowledge covering approximately 29,137,000 attributes and approximately 1,468,000 licenses. The term licenses includes not only locations, but 
5

also the number of persons and other entities managed on our platform, such as physicians, wealth advisors and insurance agents, among others. We believe this term reflects the broadening of our business into new services and our current pricing methodology.
We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our revenue was $170.2 million, $124.3 million and $89.7 million, respectively, our net loss was $66.6 million, $43.2 million and $26.5 million, respectively, and our non‑GAAP net loss was $44.2 million, $33.3 million and $22.0 million, respectively.
Industry Background
Consumer Discovery Has Changed. Intelligent search has grown significantly in recent years. Businesses are now able to leverage intelligent search to help individuals discover what they need without having to necessarily visit the business’s own website and return digital knowledge directly responsive to a search. 
Knowledge Is Fundamental. Businesses spend significant sums on developing their brands and creating product and market awareness. When potential consumers reached through those efforts want to make a purchase, businesses need their digital knowledge to be widely available and correct so that they can be found efficiently. Inaccurate or incomplete information results in lost sales opportunities, negative brand experiences and organizational inefficiencies.
Intelligent Search Drives Commerce. When searching for a business, consumers need to know many relevant attributes such as the address, phone number, menu options of a restaurant or operating hours. As a result, businesses and professional service providers must ensure that their digital knowledge is available, accurate and consistent so that they can be found. Moreover, businesses and professional service providers want to make sure that they appear prominently online when nearby consumers search for them. 
Managing Digital Knowledge Is Challenging
Many businesses lack the capabilities to effectively control, structure and manage digital knowledge across the digital ecosystem where consumers discover businesses. This lack of management capability is due to several factors:

• | Lack of Control of Digital Knowledge. The vast majority of digital knowledge currently comes from third‑party sources such as data aggregators, governmental agencies and consumers. The net result of this third‑party sourcing has been to produce “best guess” data that can often miss or misstate the true digital knowledge for businesses worldwide. 


• | Attributes that Comprise Digital Knowledge Are Expanding. Businesses need to be able to define their digital knowledge using detailed, category-specific attributes about their business ranging from name, address and phone number to more detailed items such as whether a hotel accepts pets, a restaurant has a gluten-free menu or a doctor accepts certain insurance plans. 


• | Digital Knowledge Is Dynamic. Digital knowledge increasingly includes dynamic attributes that change frequently, such as opening hours, holiday hours, menus and promotions. 


• | Digital Knowledge Exists in Many Places. The number of applications that leverage digital knowledge continues to increase, with the proliferation of vertical search applications and intelligent search using mobile, voice-based and in-app search. Businesses need an efficient way to control their digital knowledge across a multitude of services, such as Google, Facebook and Yelp. 

Businesses Need to Provide Customers with Relevant and Actionable Information. When consumers search for businesses, they expect to be able to quickly find all of the relevant information they need about those organizations. Furthermore, the increase in the number of mobile users around the world has resulted in the need for business information to be available on the applications where consumers engage and to be presented in a way that is consistent with the language and customs of each geography in which consumers reside.
Existing Alternatives Are Inadequate. Traditional methods for managing digital knowledge include paper or legacy software‑based solutions, such as word processors or spreadsheets. Simply managing and updating information within the few core search engines, such as Google and Bing, through these traditional methods is already very challenging, and becomes even more so when implementing updates on newer services such as Instagram, Snapchat and Uber. 
Customer Reviews Are of Critical and Growing Importance. Many major applications now include customer review data in their search results and may rank businesses and professional service providers based on the number, quality and recency of reviews. A limited number of reviews or a few poor reviews without offsetting positive reviews may result in businesses being placed further down in the search rankings provided by some applications.
Growth Strategy
Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Grow Our Customer Base. We believe that there is a substantial opportunity to continue to increase the size of our customer base across a broad range of industries and companies, and to include more professional service providers, 

6

such as individual doctors, insurance agents and financial services professionals, in addition to businesses. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our customer base, both domestically and internationally.

• | Continue to Enter Attractive Industry Verticals. As of January 31, 2018, we have addressed specific industry verticals, such as healthcare, retail and financial services, and we plan to continue this go-to-market strategy. More recently we have introduced Yext for Mortgage for the consumer lending industry and Yext for Food for the food services industry. 


• | Expand Existing Customer Relationships. We continue to expand our relationships with existing customers. For example, some businesses may initially purchase our solution only for their stores in a particular country. We also up‑sell additional features, such as Pages and Reviews, to existing customers, who generally start with our entry‑level Listings feature. See "—Sales and Marketing" for a discussion of customer retention and our ability to expand customer relationships. 


• | Expand Internationally. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand the use of our platform outside the United States. We derived more than 10% of our revenue from non‑U.S. sales in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 and we believe there are substantial opportunities to increase sales to customers outside of the United States as well as to help our existing U.S.‑based customers manage data for more of their international business. We have an established presence in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Switzerland, Japan and China and we intend to further expand our footprint to other regions. 


• | Develop and Market New Products and Features. We are committed to developing and marketing innovative capabilities for our customers to meet their digital knowledge management needs. We will continue to invest in platform and features development to help our customers better control their digital knowledge. In January 2018, we launched Knowledge Assistant, which allows customers to text or message updates into the Knowledge Engine or respond to reviews using a simple, conversational interface. In November 2017, we introduced Yext for Events, a feature that enables businesses to manage the public knowledge about their events and create event pages and calendars. 


• | Extend the PowerListings Network. We plan to continue to expand our PowerListings Network. In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 we expanded our PowerListings Network to approximately 150 applications. We are increasing our focus on adding more industry vertical-specific and international services to our PowerListings Network as well as including new services that may become more commonly used in the future. 


• | Expand Our Developer Platform. We opened up our Knowledge Engine to developers with the introduction of our Yext Developer platform. Yext Developer offers our customers the ability to integrate into other systems to give our customers programmatic control of their organization’s digital knowledge. We believe that the introduction of our Yext Developer platform will further expand the ways that our Knowledge Engine can be utilized and increase customer retention.

The Yext Knowledge Engine 
The Yext Knowledge Engine is our cloud‑based platform that powers our key capabilities allowing customers to control their digital knowledge and the content of their local landing pages and to manage their consumer reviews, all from a single login. From our Knowledge Engine customers can centralize, control and manage more than 100 standard data fields, including name, address and phone number, map marker, holiday hours, location‑specific promotions, photo and video content and social links, use the data to power and update their local landing pages and make this information available through our PowerListings Network of approximately 150 maps, apps, search engines, intelligent GPS systems, digital assistants, vertical directories and social networks in a complete, up to date and accurate manner. 
Our Knowledge Engine powers all of our key features, including Listings, Pages and Reviews.
Listings
Our Listings feature allows our customers to control digital knowledge specific to location data so that updates are controlled through our platform, and then sync and update the content across our PowerListings Network. Listings also enables the suppression of duplicate listings, as well as the implementation of real‑time or near‑real‑time and scheduled updates of our customers’ data.
Our PowerListings Network is comprised of approximately 150 services and applications across the globe, including major search engines, such as Bing and Google; social apps, such as Facebook; local service sites, such as Yelp; and mapping apps, such as Apple Maps and Google Maps. We have direct data integrations with applications in our PowerListings Network. As a result, our customers are able to control and update their business listings across all of these applications through our integrated platform with a single click.
Listings also provides analytics support to keep our customers informed of how their public presence across the PowerListings Network is impacting their business, including visibility into how often their listings are appearing in search results and how many people are clicking from those search results to learn more. Additionally, Listings enables our customers to control their brand content across all of their business listings to ensure a consistent message regardless of city, country or language.
Pages
Our Pages feature allows customers to establish specialized landing pages for their business, such as separate pages for each store, insurance agent or doctor’s office, on their own websites and to manage rich and compelling digital content on those sites, including calls to action. Pages are automatically updated when the customer makes changes to the content linked to our Knowledge Engine, creating a unique, dynamic web presence for every page.
Pages are built with search engine optimization ("SEO"), best practices, structured digital knowledge using standardized schema.org-defined standards, a fully configurable URL scheme and a consistent cross‑device experience to assist our customers’ stores, agents, offices or service centers to increase their websites’ search engine visibility and traffic. Schema.org is an open and collaborative initiative launched by certain large search engines that defines the vocabulary and format for structured markup. Customers can work with Yext to build custom landing pages or can build and manage their own webpages using data stored in the Knowledge Engine and Yext’s platform functionality to add schema.org tagging and page content.
Our Pages feature has the functionality to automatically display our customers’ most convenient location to consumers who are searching, enabling the filtering and refinement of searches on websites by address, zip code, landmark, service and more. Additionally, Pages enhances the visibility of our customers’ websites by categorizing their businesses based on the product lines or services that they offer and supports multi‑lingual content storage, allowing our customers to provide targeted content to their prospective end consumers and to organize digital knowledge so that consumers and search engines are able to more easily locate the information they are searching for.
Reviews
Our Reviews feature enables customers to encourage and facilitate reviews from their end consumer, thereby increasing the quantity and quality of the reviews available to potential consumers, the tools to manage their reviews from multiple sources across our PowerListings Network from a single location.
Our Review Publishing platform utilizes SEO best practices, enhancing the visibility of the customer reviews on our customers' websites. Additionally, our Review Quarantine feature allows our customers to hold their customer reviews for up to seven days before they go live, permitting our customers to address authentic but negative feedback before it becomes public and automatically flags inauthentic or inappropriate reviews for removal.
8

Our Reviews feature also leverages our direct integrations across the PowerListings Network to pull all of our customers’ reviews, from every location managed on our platform, into a single dashboard so that our customers can stay informed in an efficient manner. It also has functionality to alert our customers with a notification once new reviews become available and provides a platform for our customer to respond to reviews and engage with their customers directly from the Yext Knowledge Engine. Reviews also allows our customers to view and generate reports that display metrics of their ratings and reviews, based upon location, website or service and other factors.
Key Additional Features of the Yext Knowledge Engine
Although our Knowledge Engine is used most heavily to support our key features, including Listings, Pages and Reviews, the platform also provides our customers with a number of additional key features and benefits including:

• | Core Data. Our platform contains a centralized hub for all our customers' data that defines their stores, offices, physicians, branches, ATMs, agents, dealerships, restaurants or service centers. Purpose‑built for managing attributes related to any entity managed in the platform, it supports more than 100 standard data fields, from address and phone number to payment methods, search categories, holiday hours, product and menu lists and location‑specific offers. Editing data, in bulk or for individual records, is easy. 


• | Geocoding and Data Cleansing. Upon implementation, all of our customers benefit from our rigorous data cleansing process to help ensure their data is formatted consistently and completely, regardless of the number of entities managed on our platform and the number of attributes. Our operations team reviews data to detect inconsistencies, discrepancies, and missing fields. We help our customers ensure that their data is correct and complete, and we work with them to find the best way to fill any gaps we find. As part of our rigorous data cleansing process, we verify all customers’ coordinates with some of the largest mapping providers in the PowerListings Network-including Google Maps and Bing-so that customers’ map pins appear correctly to both drivers and pedestrians. 


• | Bulk Data Management. In our user‑friendly Partner Portal, customers can take bulk actions as needed, including uploading, editing, exporting and moving managed entities within their account, and to the extent applicable creating social posts. 


• | Knowledge Tags. Our Knowledge Tags feature allows customers to add schema mark-up to their websites to make the content on the website easier to find in search results.


• | APIs. Our low‑latency APIs make it easy for customers to ensure that all of their internal systems work consistently when connecting with the Knowledge Engine. 


• | Custom Fields. Custom fields make it easy for our customers to extend their existing data model to our Knowledge Engine. We work with our customers to define the custom fields that represent their data management strategy best, like brand, open status or square footage. Customers can add custom fields that support URLs, photos, yes/no answers or 12 additional data validation types to manage information related to their business on their own terms. 


• | Multilingual Content Support. Our Multi‑Language Data Storage allows our customers to present a tailored experience to diverse consumers locally and worldwide while maintaining data consistency, avoiding discrepancies and satisfying local customers. Additionally, our industry expertise and direct PowerListings Network relationships support our customers’ global scale and expansion with smart, pre‑formatted addresses, phone numbers and payment options for which we can support approximately 200 countries and 100 languages and dialects. 


• | Local User Portal. Our customizable and extensible Local User Portal delivers a branded experience to franchisees, agents or advisors, giving local managers an active role in managing the digital knowledge that consumers seek while maintaining brand compliance. 


• | User Roles and Approval Workflows. Our flexible, scalable user roles, workflows and approvals give our customers the option to allow franchisees or local managers to manage data for their business while letting corporate management maintain total brand control. Management can empower franchisees or local managers to contribute key data about their individual properties that give their online presence a personal touch, including hours of operation, photos and local specials. Our flexible workflows support the processes and controls of business so managers can give individuals users, such as their employees, franchisees or local or regional managers, as much or as little responsibility as they would like. Those users can request edits to any data field, while approvers can review requested changes, accept, reject or reassign those changes, and explain their decisions to those who made the request. Our Smart Notifications make it easy to comply and collaborate. 


• | Knowledge Assistant. Knowledge Assistant lets businesses text or message updates into the Knowledge Engine or respond to reviews using a simple, conversational interface. 


• | Scheduled Content and Digital Asset Management. Changes to digital knowledge, from holiday hours to featured promotions to social posts, can be scheduled to post automatically on the dates desired. Our customers are able to view 

9

all the locations that leverage a digital asset such as a photo, video or text, in order to keep track of where and when photos and offers appear to consumers.

• | Analytics Hub. Analytics keep our customers informed of how their public presence across services drives business for their brands. For example, customers can view how often their listings appear in search, how many people click from those search results to learn more, the terms for which their individual business locations appear to consumers and favorite Instagram hashtags to post from those locations. Via our direct data integrations with applications in the PowerListings Network, customers control the URL that their listings drive to, so they can tie their listings back to the conversion metric of their choice. 


• | App Directory. The App Directory extends the utility of data stored in the Knowledge Engine to many other software systems. These self-serve, pre-built integrations allow a business to connect information from various systems across the company such as workforce management systems and CRM databases to create a single customer-facing view of their public information.

Our Technology
Our cloud‑based platform is designed to scale as we continue to add customers and allows us to support digital knowledge for the locations, persons and entities managed with our platform and the millions of associated attributes. The platform is built primarily with industry‑standard open source technology. We use a microservices‑based architecture to maximize the manageability, flexibility and scalability of our software as it continues to grow more complex. We also employ a modern continuous delivery approach to building, testing and deploying our software.
Hosting
The majority of our customer‑facing software is run from two co‑location data centers. To provide the highest level of up‑time and lowest latency for our platform capabilities, key high‑volume services are hosted by third‑party hosting services, which allows easier and greater scalability and provides for redundancy.
Data Structure
Our Yext Knowledge Engine allows customers to collect, store and manage structured data, consistent with standards published by schema.org. Schema.org is an open and collaborative initiative launched by certain large search engines that defines the vocabulary and format for structured markup. Search engines like Google and Bing consume local data through structured markup placed in the underlying code of web pages.
We actively monitor and track the schema.org standards so that our Yext Knowledge Engine stores and publishes data in accordance with the most current schema.org specifications.
Interfaces with our PowerListings Network
We rely on integrations with each of the applications in our PowerListings Network that enable us to accomplish some or all of the following key tasks with members of our PowerListings Network:

• | search for existing listings and retrieve details about them, in order to match our customers’ digital knowledge to existing listing data;


• | claim listings and deliver updated digital knowledge content;


• | retrieve or get notified about reviews and allow review response; and


• | obtain statistics about traffic on listings to display to our customers in the platform.

Over the years, we have developed special integrations with a number of the applications in our PowerListings Network. We have also worked with the major application providers in the PowerListings Network to develop trust and strong working relationships, resulting in specific operational workflows, processes for issue resolution, and specialized technology and processes tailored to the nuances of each. For smaller PowerListings Network application providers, we have developed our own API specifications that each provider builds and implements for integration with our Yext Knowledge Engine.
Our Customers
As of January 31, 2018, we served businesses with locations in over 100 countries. These include many leading businesses in a diverse set of industries, such as healthcare, retail and financial services. For this purpose, we define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity, such as a company, a government institution, a franchisor, a service provider or agency or a distinct business unit of a large corporation that has an active contract directly with us.
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. One reseller customer, Dex Media, currently known as Dex-YP, accounted for approximately 10% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016.

Sales and Marketing 
We sell our solution globally to customers of all sizes through direct sales efforts to our customers, including third‑party resellers, and through a self‑service purchase process. Most of our third-party reseller customers serve small businesses or non‑U.S. businesses, while we serve the significant majority of enterprise and mid‑size business customers through our direct sales force. In transactions with resellers, we are only party to the transaction with the reseller and are not a party to the reseller’s transaction with its customer. 
Our sales organization varies by market within each country and will change over time as we build critical mass and address various verticals within a market. As of January 31, 2018, we had 131 quota-carrying sales representatives compared to 100 as of January 31, 2017. We plan to continue to grow our sales and marketing organization as we expand globally.
Through our direct sales efforts, we offer annual and multi-year subscriptions to our platform. Our pricing strategy generally varies based on the number of licenses managed by a customer and the level of service and features that a customer requires. Until October 2015, we generally offered various customized levels of access to some or all of our features in our platform on a subscription basis with pricing based on the number of locations and features used. Beginning in October 2015, we began pricing new subscriptions in a more discrete range of packages, with pricing based on specified feature sets and the number of locations managed by the customer with our platform. More recently, we began pricing subscriptions based not only on the number of physical locations, but also on the number of persons and other entities managed on our platform, such as physicians, wealth advisors and insurance agents, among others. We now refer to these locations, persons and other entities collectively as "licenses," which we believe reflects the broadening of our business into new services and our current pricing methodology.
We categorize our current packages as Base, Starter, Professional and Ultimate, which start with basic access to the Knowledge Engine and successively include access to additional capabilities at a higher cost. Many of our customers initially deploy a Starter or Professional subscription to control and manage their digital knowledge using the Listings feature. Some customers start with the Base subscription if they only need internal data management. As customers realize the benefits of our platform, many have increased or expanded their existing subscription levels to obtain greater access to our key features, such as Pages and Reviews, as they need them.
We believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue they generate for us over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long‑term value of our customer relationships. We assess our performance in this respect using a metric we refer to as our dollar‑based net retention rate. Our dollar‑based net retention rate was 109%, 119%, and 121% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The overall decline in the rate during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily attributed to mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcies of certain customers; however, the net retention rate with our enterprise customers remained generally consistent with the prior year. We calculate this metric for a particular period by first establishing a cohort of the enterprise, mid‑size and reseller customers who had active contracts at the end of each month of the same period in the prior year. We divide the single month revenue from each of those customer cohorts for the applicable month in the current year by the single month revenue of that same customer cohort for the corresponding month in the prior year. We then determine the dollar‑based weighted average of each of the monthly rates, and this average represents the dollar‑based net retention rate for the period. We only consider revenue from enterprise and mid‑size customers and reseller customers when calculating this metric since small businesses that have limited locations experience inherently high turnover. Our revenue from direct sales to small businesses represented less than 20% of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and we expect it to decline further as a percentage of total revenue as our other channels increase, although not in absolute dollars.
Customer Support and Professional Services
Our account services team provides customer support for each of our customers. Support begins in the customer acquisition phase and continues throughout the duration of the relationship. Customer support includes working with customers on launch and on‑boarding, ongoing support, assessment of solution and feature mix, analytics and renewal. We also have a dedicated professional services team. This team provides support to customers that require custom development services, may have special operational needs or may require more custom analytics.
Research and Development
As of January 31, 2018, our research and development organization had 114 employees. Our global research and development organization uses and shares the same technology, platform development tools and data across various sites. Our research and development expenses were $25.7 million, $19.3 million and $16.2 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an essential element of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark, copyright and other intellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also license certain third‑party technology for use in conjunction with our platform.
We believe that our continued success depends on hiring and retaining highly capable and innovative employees, especially as it relates to our engineering base. It is our policy that our employees and independent contractors involved in development are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated 
11

by them on our behalf are our property and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent intellectual property that we own or license. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.
Patents and Patent Applications
As of January 31, 2018, we had eight issued U.S. patents, three non‑provisional and one provisional U.S. patent applications and four international Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications pending, of which we have filed one national stage application in the European Union. The issued patents have expiration dates ranging from 2032 to 2035. Although we actively attempt to utilize patents to protect our technologies, we believe that none of our patents, individually or in the aggregate, are material to our business. We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. However, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority to be invalid or unenforceable.
Trademarks
We rely on registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. As of January 31, 2018, we had 54 trademarks registered globally. “Yext” and “PowerListings” are registered trademarks in the United States and in certain other countries.
Competition
The market for digital knowledge management, particularly for location and location‑related data, is new and rapidly evolving, and we face many competitors with a variety of product offerings. Our primary competition comes from businesses that choose to handle digital knowledge management in‑house using manual, paper and spreadsheet‑based systems that corporate personnel employ in a fragmented manner rather than pay for a third‑party solution. In addition, some small companies may offer products and solutions at lower price points than us or that compete with some but not all of the features present in our platform and solutions. As we introduce new features and our existing platform evolves, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition.
We believe that we generally compete favorably with our competitors because of the size and breadth of our integration and relationships with the applications in our PowerListings Network, the features and performance of our platform and our various solutions, the ease of integration of our solutions with the technological infrastructures of our customers and the incremental marketing benefits and return on investment that our various solutions offer to our customers.
