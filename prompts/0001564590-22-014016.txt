Item 1. Business 
Overview
 Ooma provides leading communications services and related technologies that bring unique features, ease of use, and affordability to businesses of all sizes and residential customers through our smart software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) and unified communications platforms. For businesses, we deliver advanced voice and collaboration features including messaging, intelligent virtual attendants, and video conferencing to help them run more efficiently. For consumers, our residential phone service provides PureVoice high-definition voice quality, advanced functionality and integration with mobile devices.
 We drive the adoption of our platforms by providing communications solutions to the large and growing markets for business, residential and mobile users, and then facilitate growth by offering new and innovative connected services to our user base. Our customers typically adopt our platforms by making a purchase or rental of our on-premise devices, connecting to the internet and activating services, for which they primarily pay on a monthly basis. We believe we have achieved high levels of customer satisfaction, retention and loyalty. Our business and residential phone service solutions are each top-ranked by our customers according to surveys by PC Mag and Consumer Reports, respectively. 
 Our services rely upon the following main elements: our multi-tenant cloud service, on-premise devices, desktop and mobile applications, end-point devices and calling platform. Ooma’s cloud provides a high-quality, secure, managed and reliable connection integrating every element of our platforms. Our platforms power all aspects of our business, providing a high-volume, low-cost infrastructure for our communications solutions, and enabling a number of other current and future productivity, automation, monitoring, safety, security and networking infrastructure applications and services.
We generate revenues primarily from the sale of subscriptions and other services for our business and residential communications solutions. We primarily offer our solutions in the U.S. and Canada. We believe that our differentiated solutions and our long-term customer relationships uniquely position us to add new connected services and exploit adjacent markets. We believe that our platforms are particularly well-suited to enable the delivery of connected services because they are always on, monitored and interactive. 
 We have experienced strong revenue growth in recent periods. Our total revenue was $192.3 million, $168.9 million and $151.6 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have grown our combined Ooma Business and Ooma Residential core users to approximately 1,100,000 as of January 31, 2022. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” below for additional information. 
 We were incorporated in 2003 as a Delaware corporation and our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “OOMA.” Our corporate headquarters are located in Sunnyvale, California. Our primary website address is www.ooma.com.

Our Solutions
 Ooma Business
 Our mission is providing business communications services that are simple, easy to use, and deliver excellent value to small, medium-sized and large companies. We offer a range of solutions to fit each business’ needs, along with personalized support to resolve any issues in deploying and maintaining Ooma services. We refer to Ooma Office and Ooma Enterprise collectively as Ooma Business. 
Ooma Office
 Ooma Office is a cloud-based multi-user communications system for small and medium-sized businesses designed to manage communications in and out of the office with a suite of powerful features at an affordable price. Ooma Office is simple and intuitive to setup and use, mobile-friendly, scalable, and provides a variety of configurations to meet our customers’ specific needs. Customers have their choice of equipment for voice service, including IP phones, smartphones, PCs and traditional analog phones. Ooma Office provides a curated set of advanced features, managed through an online portal, including a virtual receptionist, SMS and MMS messaging, extension dialing, ring groups, call park, audio conferencing, music-on-hold, intercom/paging, and voicemail forwarding to e-mail. The Ooma Office mobile app allows virtual deployment without hardware, so users can make, receive and transfer phone calls, listen to voicemails, text, and manage their Ooma account on the go from any iOS or Android device.
 Ooma Office Pro provides a set of additional features that are designed for businesses whose needs are above and beyond our standard Ooma Office service, including: HD video conferencing (Ooma Meetings), call recording, call analytics, caller info match, enhanced robocall blocking, voicemail transcription, and integrations with Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 applications. The Office desktop app for Pro users conveniently enables users to have their complete business communications system on their PCs and Macs to make and receive calls, host and join video meetings, use SMS and MMS messaging, access company directories, access in-depth caller profiles for both inbound and outbound calls, and other capabilities. The app works anywhere the computer has an internet connection, keeping employees and teams connected while working from home, on the road, or in the office. 
 We also offer the following additional services to our Ooma Office customers:
 Ooma Connect delivers fixed wireless internet connectivity to replace or back-up slow and costly DSL, satellite, and cable services. This solution consists of the Ooma Connect Base Station and the cellular antenna, which provides wireless internet through a nationwide advanced cellular network. Our Continuous Voice technology for internet back-up improves call quality by sending redundant voice streams across both the primary and wireless Internet link.
 Ooma Managed Wi-Fi is a plug-and-play enterprise-grade Wi-Fi solution that is designed to take the complexity and high cost out of wireless networking for small and medium-sized businesses. Ooma Wi-Fi enables businesses in industries such as retail, restaurant, and hospitality to support Wi-Fi IP phones on Ooma Office, Wi-Fi access for guests, and securely connect online payment systems and cloud-based applications, such as Microsoft Office, Google Workspace or CRM systems.
Ooma Enterprise
 Ooma Enterprise is a highly customizable, flexible, and scalable unified-communications-as-a-service (“UCaaS”) solution that complements Ooma Office and allows us to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes. Telecommunications and networking services available through Ooma Enterprise include mobile and softphone telephony, presence and instant messaging, multiparty audio, video and web conferencing, and call center capabilities with full Application Programming Interface (“API”) support. 
 Our enterprise UCaaS platform enables easy drag-and-drop call flow management, using modular applications that can be selectively enabled to suit customer needs. Some of these applications include WebRTC, Call Center, Mobile and Desktop applications, Team Chat, and a distinctive reporting portal for end users and administrators. Additionally, for our call center customers, we offer agents and call center managers the ability to visualize their performance through their day or over time with custom reporting solutions. Our global cloud-based network provides business-class security, redundancy, and failover, as well as uniquely routes calls through the shortest path to provide the highest voice quality.

Our platform is built on an open API architecture that enables agility, customizations, and integrations into back-end solutions such as CRM, predictive analytics, accounting and customer renewal systems, either internally or via third party developers. This gives Ooma Enterprise customers the ability to streamline business processes and ensure their customers are serviced faster, boosting satisfaction, repeat orders, referrals, and revenues in addition to enabling their users to improve productivity.
 In addition, we offer Ooma Direct Routing for Microsoft Teams. Through our global network, every device enabled with the Teams app – desktops, laptops, smart phones and tablets – becomes a fully functional business phone that connects Teams users to external phone lines.
 Ooma AirDial
 In November 2021, we announced Ooma AirDial, a complete integrated solution for business intended to address the expected decommissioning of legacy copper-wire analog phone service, also known as plain old telephone service (“POTS”). Ooma AirDial will combine phone service, a data connection and hardware in a single package that is designed to be easy to install and manage. Safety and business-critical systems that today require a POTS line – including elevator phones, fax machines, public safety phones, building access systems and more – can be quickly and easily migrated to a digital connection.  We commenced selling AirDial during the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

 Ooma Residential includes Ooma Telo basic and premier services as well as our smart security solutions. Our residential phone service provides PureVoice HD voice quality, advanced functionality and integration with mobile devices. Overall, our residential platform enables an ecosystem for connected services by integrating with other automation solutions to enable innovative and valuable features.

 Ooma Basic provides unlimited personal calling within the U.S. and features such as: voicemail access, call waiting, caller ID, network address book and 911 calling, with text alerts when 911 is dialed from the home. Our Ooma Mobile HD app allows users to make and receive phone calls and access Ooma features and settings with any iOS or Android device over a Wi-Fi or cellular data connection.

We also offer other premium subscription services to our customers, independent of Ooma Premier, including an international calling plan and voicemail transcription service. 
Home Phone Products
 We offer three ways to connect to our residential phone services:
 Ooma Telo is a complete home communications solution designed to serve as the primary phone line in the home, delivering high-quality voice communications, advanced calling features and connected services that are not offered by traditional landlines. Users make a one-time purchase of an Ooma Telo and plug it into a high-speed internet connection and standard home phone devices. Users have the option to transfer their existing phone number for a one-time fee or to select a new number at no cost. Once set up, users have access to free nationwide calling, international calling with low rates and the features described above. 
 Ooma Telo Air is a wireless Ooma Telo with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities that connects to the internet using the home’s Wi-Fi network and can be paired with mobile phones to answer incoming calls from any phone in the home. 
 Ooma Telo 4G combines the Ooma Telo base station with the Ooma 4G Cellular Adapter and battery back-up to deliver an always-on home phone solution with all of the advanced features provided by our unique cloud-based residential platform. 
Home Security 
 Ooma Smart Security is an innovative security and monitoring platform that utilizes our Ooma Telo products to provide do-it-yourself home security and awareness through a range of sensors including: door and window, motion, garage door, water, alarm siren, and a keypad that acts as a physical control panel for the security system. Ooma Smart Security also offers professional monitoring services, remote 911 features and multi-user geofencing capabilities to automatically arm and disarm the security system. The Ooma Smart Security mobile app for iOS and Android is the interface through which users interact with the system to pair sensors, toggle between home and away modes, check activity logs and manage and receive notifications.
Talkatone 
 Our Talkatone mobile app is available to anyone with an iOS or Android mobile device and can be downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google Play for free. Registered users choose their own phone number to make and receive free texts and calls to most U.S. and Canadian numbers using a Wi-Fi or cellular data connection within and out-of-network. Talkatone also enables users to call, text, chat and share with friends and family that do not have the app installed. Advertising is displayed within the mobile app and users can choose to purchase premium services such as ad-free usage and international calling plans.

Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing objective is to grow our customer base and sell to our existing customers additional services using an integrated and multi-channel marketing approach. We continually test and refine our marketing and sales tactics to drive sales at a low customer acquisition cost. 
Marketing and Advertising
 Online. We use online marketing including search engine marketing, search engine optimization, online video, digital display advertising and social media to attract customers as they do online research for the products and services we offer. We continue to reach out to our prospect leads over time using e-mail and telemarketing until they purchase or the lead is retired. 
 Traditional. We use radio advertising to build awareness and interest for our products and services, which benefits both Ooma Business and Ooma Residential. We believe that radio advertising provides an opportunity to build the Ooma brand cost-effectively, educate prospects on Ooma’s unique combination of quality and value, and capture prospects’ attention. Businesses and consumers who hear our ads are directed to our web site, our inbound sales personnel, and/or to key retail partners. 
 Word-of-mouth. We actively mobilize our customers and brand advocates to spread word-of-mouth marketing by sharing Ooma news and information through social media and e-mail. We sell additional services to our existing customer base by offering free trials and promotional offers, as well as sending e-mail communications and leaving messages on their Ooma voicemail service. 
Sales, Customers and Backlog 
 Our business and residential products are sold through direct channels, retailers, value-added resellers, master agents and other resellers. The direct channel, value-added resellers and master agents are our primary distribution channels for business solutions and direct and retail are our primary distribution channels for residential customers. Our direct sales force is focused on business sales and includes trained sales representatives located in the U.S. and Canada responding to inbound telephone calls and sales leads generated through marketing activity and our website and third-party web sites.
Our retail distribution includes national and regional consumer electronics, big box retailers and leading online retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, Costco.com, Walmart.com and others. We also have strategic partnerships with third parties, such as T-Mobile, which enables us to sell our services and products to certain of their customers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 Our service plans are generally sold as monthly subscriptions; however, certain plans are also offered as annual and multi-year subscriptions. Products are generally shipped and billed shortly after receipt of an order. We do not believe that our product backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue in any given period as such orders may be rescheduled or cancelled without penalty prior to shipment. The majority of our product revenue comes from orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter. 
 Customer Support 
 Our primary customer support objective is to satisfy our customers and educate them on the features and benefits of our products to optimize the overall user experience. We employ an active customer management strategy in which we drive incremental revenue through cross-selling of products and services. Our customer support teams also manage the porting process for our customers as well as billing and payment activities. 
 We maintain two customer contact centers: one operated by us in Newark, California, which primarily supports our business customers, and the other operated by a third-party provider in Manila, Philippines, which primarily supports our residential customers. In addition, our offices located in Vancouver, British Columbia and Boca Raton, Florida support our enterprise customers. We utilize a variety of communication media to serve the needs of our customers including telephone, online chat, online tutorials and e-mail.

Engineering, Research and Development
We take an integrated approach to the development of our technology. Our extensive engineering resources span both hardware and software, and our business scope encompasses the entire platform from user devices such as handsets to cloud infrastructure, giving us the ability to create unique features and services for our customers. We believe our integrated engineering and business strategy is a significant competitive advantage and makes it feasible for us to leverage our platforms to deliver a broad range of productivity, automation and infrastructure connected services. 
 We have invested significant time and resources into developing our engineering, research and development team, resulting in a group with diverse skills, ranging from digital and radio frequency hardware design to embedded software, network software, telecommunications, database architecture, operations support systems, billing, security, web design and mobile app development. Because our team develops and integrates our solutions, we are able to offer a solution that works seamlessly between software and hardware and respond to customer feedback to add in additional features and services that work across our platforms. Our team consists of a core set of engineers located primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area, augmented by development teams in several international locations. 
 Operations and Manufacturing 
 We currently serve most of our customers from three separate data center facilities located in Northern California, Texas and Virginia, where we lease space from Equinix, Inc. We also lease data center space in certain cities in Europe. While our service operations are partially redundant, account provisioning and billing are operated out of the San Jose facility for most of our customers. Our network operations and carrier operations teams are responsible for designing our core routing and switching infrastructure, managing growth and maintenance (including the introduction of new services) and orchestrating vendor relationships for hosted services, IP transit and carrier services and daily operation of our cloud and other services. The design of these services, and the tools for monitoring and managing them, are developed in combination with our engineering team. 
 We primarily contract with manufacturers in China and other Asian countries to produce our on-premise devices and end-point devices. We configure and ship to our channel partners and end users through our internal manufacturing and logistics team based in Newark, California. Our internal logistics team also manages reverse logistics for channel and warranty returns and works closely with our engineering team to develop tooling and processes that bring new products into production.

Competition
 The market for communications solutions and other connected services for business, home and mobile users is very large, complex, fragmented and defined by changing technology and customer demands. We expect competition to continue to increase in the future. We believe that the defining factors driving competition in our market include: 

• | Quality and consistency of communications services;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Lifetime value of initial investment and ongoing cost of services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Breadth of features and capabilities;
--+--------------------------------------


• | System reliability, availability and performance;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Speed and ease of activation, setup, and configuration;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Ownership and control of the proprietary technology;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Integration with multiple end-point devices and mobile solutions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer satisfaction and brand loyalty; and
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Ability to effectively access reseller channels
--+------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. We face competition from a broad range of providers of communications solutions and other connected services for business, home and mobile users. Some of these competitors include: 
  
• | Established communications providers, such as AT&T Inc., Comcast Corporation, Verizon Communications Inc. and Rogers Communications Inc;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other cloud-based communications companies such as RingCentral Inc., Vonage Holdings Corp, 8x8 Inc., Nextiva, Inc., Intermedia.net Inc., Dialpad Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Zoom Video Communications, Inc., and Alphabet Inc. (Google Voice); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Traditional on-premise hardware business communications providers such as Avaya Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc. and Mitel, Inc.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All of these companies currently or may in the future host their solutions through the cloud. Additionally, we recently entered the POTS replacement market and our new AirDial product will face competition from other companies, such as Granite Telecommunications LLC and DataRemote Inc., promoting their own POTS-related products and solutions. 
 See the section entitled “Risks Related to Our Business and Industry” in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" below for more information related to competition.

Human Capital 
 People and Culture.  We view our people and our company culture as key to our success. We aim to attract and retain talented people representing diverse perspectives and skills, who are driven by our common Ooma values: 
 We care that everyone loves their Ooma experience.
 We think big to innovate and revolutionize markets.
 We create smarter solutions that uniquely deliver both superior experiences and superior value.
 We embrace diversity of thought to make the best decisions.
 We respect that problems are best solved by fact-based discussions and positive intent.
 We choose to be a force for good in the world.
 From time-to-time, we conduct confidential company-wide surveys to capture our employees’ views of the organization, company goals and job satisfaction, which our senior leadership team reviews and acts upon, as appropriate. Our employees are encouraged to engage with company leadership and openly raise concerns and questions, including via our quarterly employee communications meeting with the CEO and senior management team.  Our management team also regularly hosts “Ask and Answer” sessions across the organization to create more opportunities for employees to communicate, share ideas and learn about Ooma.  
 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion (“DEI”) and Racial Justice.  Our commitment to DEI and racial justice is more than the policies and practices we develop and adhere to – it is an integral part of who we are and how we operate. We believe it is our responsibility to embrace a diverse employee workforce, build a strong and caring culture of inclusion and lead with both passion and compassion. We believe our diversity makes us strong and have pledged along with the Silicon Valley Leadership Group to be an agent of sustainable change. Our internal DEI and Racial Justice committee leads our commitment to put this pledge into action and provides an open door to all of our personnel who would like to actively contribute to the effort.  We believe a diverse and inclusive workforce serves to enrich our employee experience. 
 Compensation and Benefits.  We aim to provide our employees competitive salaries and benefit programs that help meet the varying needs of our workforce. These programs include an employee stock purchase plan, equity awards and bonuses, a 401(k) retirement plan with a company match, healthcare benefits, paid time off and family leave, and flexible work arrangements. We conduct annual benchmarking to assess our compensation and benefit programs against those of our peers.  
 Community Support.  We believe in giving back and promoting community outreach through corporate giving and employee volunteerism. Through our “Ooma Giving Back” program, we partner with certain non-profit organizations to help support several local communities. 
Employees and Contractors 
 As of January 31, 2022, we had a total of 383 full-time employees, all of whom are located in the U.S. and Canada. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, we utilize third party contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. 
Ooma | FY2022 Form 10-K | 11

Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties, as well as other contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We control access to our software, documentation and other proprietary information, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. As of January 31, 2022, we had 47 issued patents and 8 patent applications pending in the U.S. and 4 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions, all of which are associated with U.S. applications. Our issued patents will expire approximately between 2031 and 2040.  We are also a party to various license agreements with third parties who typically grant us the right to use certain third-party technology in conjunction with our products and services, or to integrate software into our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. Although our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights, we believe the technological and creative skills of our personnel, the development of new features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our products and services are the primary methods of establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. 
 See the section entitled “Risks Related to Security, IT Systems and Intellectual Property” in Item 1A. "Risk Factors” below for more information on our intellectual property risks.
 Regulatory Matters 
 Traditional telephone service historically has been subject to extensive federal and state regulation, while Internet services generally have been subject to less regulation. Because some elements of VoIP resemble the services provided by traditional telephone companies and others resemble the services provided by internet service providers, the VoIP industry has not fit easily within the existing framework of telecommunications law. The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), the U.S. Congress, and various regulatory bodies in the states and in foreign countries have imposed regulations on VoIP providers and are continuing to consider new regulatory requirements on VoIP services. 
 Federal Regulation.  As a provider of internet communications services, we are subject to a number of FCC regulations. Among others, these regulatory obligations include: contributing to the Federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund and federal programs related to phone number administration; providing access to E-911 services; protecting customer information; and porting phone numbers upon a valid customer request. 
 State Regulation.  The FCC has preempted much regulation of internet voice communications services. However, a number of states have ruled that non-nomadic internet voice communications services may or do fall within the definition of “telecommunications services” or are otherwise within state telecommunications regulatory jurisdiction and therefore those states assert that they have authority to regulate the service. Although no states currently require certification for nomadic internet voice communications service providers, a number of states have imposed certain traditional telecommunications requirements on such services. For example, a number of states require us to contribute to state USF and E-911 and pay other surcharges, which are passed through to our customers, while others are actively considering extending their public policy programs to include the services we provide. We expect that state public utility commissions will continue their attempts to apply state telecommunications regulations to internet voice communications services like ours. 
 International Regulation.  As we expand internationally, we are subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which we offer our services. Regulatory treatment of internet communications services outside the U.S. varies from country to country, is often unclear, and may be more onerous than imposed on our services in the U.S. In Canada, our service is regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (“CRTC”) which, among other things, imposes requirements similar to the U.S. related to the provision of E-911 services in all areas of Canada where the traditional telephone carrier offers such 911 services. Our regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand internationally, and on the use of our services in international locations. 
 See the section entitled “Risks Related to Regulatory and Tax Matters” in Item 1A. Risk Factors below for more information.
