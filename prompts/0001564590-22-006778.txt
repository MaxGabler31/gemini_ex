 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
 Please refer to the Executive Summary section of Part II, Item 7 “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information concerning the continuing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
 Overview
 On December 18, 2019, Xperi Corporation (“Xperi”) entered into a definitive agreement with TiVo Corporation (“TiVo”), to combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction (the “Mergers”). Following consummation of the Mergers on June 1, 2020, Xperi Holding Corporation became the parent company of both Xperi and TiVo. The common stock of both Xperi and TiVo were de-registered after completion of the Mergers. On June 2, 2020, Xperi Holding Corporation’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “XPER.” Xperi was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Mergers. As a result, the historical financial statements of Xperi for periods prior to the Mergers are considered to be the historical financial statements of Xperi Holding Corporation. As used herein, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Xperi when referring to periods prior to June 1, 2020 and Xperi Holding Corporation when referring to periods subsequent to June 1, 2020. Our results of operations include the operations of TiVo after June 1, 2020. Unless specified otherwise, the financial results in this Annual Report are those of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
 We are a leading consumer and entertainment product/solutions licensing company and one of the industry’s largest intellectual property licensing platforms, with a diverse portfolio of media and semiconductor intellectual property and more than 11,000 patents and patent applications worldwide. We create extraordinary experiences at home and on the go for millions of consumers around the world, elevating content and how audiences connect with it in a way that is more intelligent, immersive and personal. Powering smart devices, connected cars, entertainment experiences and more, we have created a unified ecosystem that reaches highly engaged consumers, uncovering new business opportunities, now and in the future. Xperi addresses one of the biggest consumer trends in entertainment today – the massive proliferation of entertainment content and the rapidly changing habits for how consumers are finding, watching and enjoying that entertainment. Our technologies are integrated into billions of consumer devices, media platforms, and semiconductors worldwide, driving increased value for partners, customers and consumers. Headquartered in Silicon Valley with operations around the world, we have approximately 1,900 employees and more than 35 years of operating experience.
 We conduct our business in two operating segments: (1) Intellectual Property (“IP”) Licensing and (2) Product. In our IP Licensing segment, we primarily license our innovations to leading companies in the broader entertainment industry, and those developing new technologies that will help drive this industry forward. Licensing arrangements include access to one or more of our foundational patent portfolios and may also include access to some of our industry-leading technologies and proven know-how. In our Product segment, we derive the majority of the revenue from licensing our technology to customers primarily through Technology License arrangements and Technology Solutions arrangements. For Technology License arrangements, the customer obtains rights to the technology delivered at the commencement of the agreement. For Technology Solutions arrangements, the customer receives access to a platform, media or data that includes frequent updates, where access to such updates is critical to the functionality of the technology.
 In February 2022, Xperi introduced “Adeia” (pronounced AH-dee-uh), the new brand for our IP Licensing Segment. Ideas are at the heart of Adeia’s business and are embedded in its new name, which means “to license” in Greek. Licensing is how Adeia goes to market – by making its ideas broadly available to the industry.
 4


We are currently planning, subject to any required regulatory approvals, a separation of our Product business and IP Licensing business through a tax-efficient transaction, resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies. We continue to evaluate the optimal timing of the contemplated business separation and currently anticipate that such separation will be completed in the second half of 2022.
 IP Licensing Segment
 The IP Licensing Segment, now operating under the Adeia brand, primarily licenses our innovations to leading companies in the broader entertainment industry, and those developing new technologies that will help drive this industry forward. Licensing arrangements include access to one or more of our foundational patent portfolios and may also include access to some of our industry-leading technologies and proven know-how.
Strategy
 We have adopted a proactive strategy designed to protect and extend our technology and intellectual property. We continue to grow our patent portfolios in size and relevance through ongoing investment in internal innovation, strategic management of our portfolios, and targeted acquisitions to enhance our portfolio for the broader entertainment industry.
 We invent, develop, and license fundamental innovations that shape the way millions of people explore and experience entertainment and enhance billions of devices in an increasingly connected world. From TVs to smartphones, in almost any place you can think of, from home to work to on the go, and in all types of entertainment experiences, from Pay-TV to over-the-top (“OTT”) delivery, managing content and connections in a way that is smart, immersive, and personal is precisely what our innovations do.
 Our patented innovations broadly cover all aspects of the entertainment experience, including guidance, discovery, search, recommendations, DVR, VOD, OTT, multi-screen, personalization, data analytics, advertising, imaging, content storage, and high-performance computing. 
 We license our patented media innovations for use with traditional linear television both in North America and internationally, and increasingly in connection with over-the-top, direct-to-consumer, and social media services that provide access to entertainment inside and outside the home on a broad array of devices. We believe the continued growth of video consumption, the evolution of how consumers explore and experience video, and need for content storage and high performance computing present new opportunities for us to continue to develop patentable innovations, expand the industries we serve, and to license additional patent rights.

Our licensing business provides a strong foundation of recurring, annual revenue. That revenue is derived from licensing our patent portfolios across multiple markets, including:  
 
 
• | Multichannel Video Programming Distributors (“MVPD”): includes cable, satellite and telecommunications television providers that aggregate and distribute linear content over their own networks (MVPDs), as well as television providers that aggregate and stream linear content over broadband networks (virtual MVPDs). Customers typically pay us a monthly per-subscriber fee and include many of the leading MVPDs and virtual MVPDs such as Altice USA (including Cablevision), AT&T (including DirecTV and AT&T Now), Charter, Comcast (including Sky), Cox, Dish Network (including Sling TV), Google (including YouTube TV), Shaw, Verizon and Vodafone.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Over-The-Top (“OTT”) Video Service Providers, Social Media and Other New Media Companies: includes subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”) service providers that offer online services and devices that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programing, content providers, networks and media companies that provide content directly to consumers through a variety of business models (e.g. SVOD, AVOD, EST, etc.) and social media companies that increasingly incorporate video as an integral part of their offerings. Customers have typically paid us fixed fees for specified periods of time and include some of the leading new media companies including Google (including YouTube), HBOMax, Peacock, Starz, Paramount (including Pluto TV) and several of the leading social media companies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumer Electronics (CE) Manufacturers: includes producers of content access points such as smart televisions, streaming media devices, video game consoles, mobile devices, DVRs and other connected media devices. Our CE licensees typically are structured as license fees based on the number of units licensed, for specified products, in defined territories. Our agreements with some of the larger CE manufacturers generally allow customers to ship an unlimited number of units, provided they pay us fixed fees for specified periods of time. Select customers include Panasonic, Roku, Samsung Electronics, TCL and Vizio.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Semiconductors: includes providers of sensors, radio frequency (RF) components, memory and logic devices commonly used in electronic products such as mobile phones, laptops, PCs, game consoles and servers. Customers typically have paid us fixed fees for specified periods of time, or a per-unit fee, and include Micron, OmniVision, Samsung, SK hynix, Sony, UMC and Yangtze Memory Technologies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We continue to strengthen the foundation of our IP Licensing Segment with several specific growth opportunities, including:
 
 
• | Greater penetration in OTT: The OTT market is currently experiencing explosive growth. For example, the largest providers of SVOD now have approximately 200 million worldwide subscribers, driven in part by the recent launch of several new services. While these services have a significantly lower ARPU when compared to traditional Pay-TV, the scale of the overall OTT video market continues to grow and presents an increasingly important licensing opportunity for our business. While we are at a comparatively earlier stage of licensing the key providers in this market, we are confident that the fundamental innovations from our patent portfolios will be similarly relevant to these new and widely-adopted OTT video services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expansion of MVPD licensing in Canada: We continue to license MVPDs in Canada and have already successfully licensed several leading providers, including two of the top five MVPDs. Licensing the remaining Canadian MVPD providers presents a significant opportunity for expanding our IP licensing business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Re-establish the Semiconductor licensing business: With the rising cost and complexity of developing cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing processes, the industry is increasingly looking beyond Moore’s Law towards advanced packaging and 3D integration technologies. Leveraging the combination of our highly-experienced technologists, scientists and engineers and our advanced research and development labs, we continue to develop industry-leading 3D integration solutions such as hybrid bonding that meet the demand for greater functionality, higher performance and smaller size for the next generation of electronics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 Due to the exclusionary nature of patent rights, we do not compete, in a traditional sense, with other patent holders for patent licensing relationships. Other patent holders do not have the same rights to the inventions and technologies encompassed by our patent portfolio. In any service, device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the provider or manufacturer may need to obtain licenses from multiple holders of intellectual property. In licensing our patent portfolio, we compete with other patent holders for a share of the royalties that certain licensees may argue to be the total royalty that is supported by a certain service(s) or product(s), which may face practical limitations. 
 7


We compete primarily with internal technology development groups within our respective technology licensing markets, who may create their own solutions that compete with technologies that we license. In general, there may be several ways to solve a particular technical problem and there can be no assurance that our inventions and approaches will be the ones generally adopted by the industry. We also compete with other companies in acquiring patent portfolios.
 Protecting Our Investment
 Although we are engaged with and have successfully licensed and transferred our technologies to many companies, some of the companies that use our patented technologies have nonetheless chosen not to enter into license agreements with us. Consequently, we have, at times, initiated litigation to enforce our IP rights and protect our investment. We view litigation as an instrument of last resort, and we use it only when our efforts to reach negotiated licenses have stalled or failed. If we are unable to secure license agreements on favorable terms through negotiations, or if licensees do not comply with the terms of their licenses, we might have to file new litigation to enforce our rights. See Part 1, Item 3-Legal Proceedings.
 Product Segment

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Off-Platform Ads: We will take household IDs from the TiVo Stream OS platform and use those IDs to target on other media sources.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monetization – TV Viewership Data 
 TiVo offers TV viewership data with program airings data for millions of households. Broadcasters, MVPDs, content producers, advertising agencies and advertisers that utilize our TV viewership data can activate subscribers’ TV viewership alone or in combination with third-party data sources using industry-leading data safe havens to target promotions and advertising directly, or through third party viewer segments, to monetize their subscriber customer base. 
Monetization – Advertising Solutions
 TiVo provides advertisers with nationwide or regionally targeted advertising on our various owned or operated devices. Advertisers place ads in a variety of display formats in both traditional linear television and digital advertising for internet delivered content, seamlessly incorporated into the user interface. Utilizing our Personalized Content Discovery platform, we also target content promotions as ‘paid search’ by directly including the sponsored content in user interface’s recommended content carousel. We work with service providers bundling their non-TiVo advertising inventory with our native inventory, thereby giving us a more significant national footprint. 
Competition
 Pay-TV
 18


There are a number of companies that produce and market advanced media solutions such as UXs, interactive program guides, DVRs, search, recommendation, natural language voice, metadata, and advanced data and analytics in the various formats which compete, or we believe will compete, with our products and services over time. Principal competitive factors include brand recognition and awareness, product and service functionality, innovation, ease of use, personalization, content access and availability, mobility and pricing. While we are competitive across this range of factors, we believe our primary competitive differentiation includes our ability to integrate all our products to create unique value to our customers and the depth and breadth of our IP portfolio. 
 Our Platform faces competition from companies such as Synamedia, MediaKind, Kudelski, Enghouse Systems Limited, and from solutions developed by multiple system operators (“MSOs”) such as Comcast X1 and Liberty Global plc’s Horizon Media, which have created competing products that provide user interface software for use on set-top-boxes and CE and mobile devices. Such companies may offer more economically attractive agreements to service providers and CE manufacturers by bundling multiple products together. We face competition for our Pay-TV product offerings from customers who choose to build their own interactive program guide and DVR solutions. We believe that we provide a strong alternative to “do-it-yourself,” as we have innovative, high-quality products ready to be implemented, with local and network DVR, integrated data distribution infrastructure and content, as well as third party services (such as VOD services). We differentiate our products by continuing to integrate our broad portfolio of products into a suite of solutions and services for our customers. We believe our solutions speed our customers’ time to market, are superior to “do-it-yourself” products, and can be deployed at a lower cost than internally-built products. 
 Video Metadata. In video metadata, we compete with other providers of entertainment-related content metadata such as Gracenote (a subsidiary of Nielsen Holdings plc) and Ericsson Group’s Red Bee Media, as well as a number of local metadata providers. While we do not believe that our competitors’ metadata sets offer the same comprehensive breadth of focus on media exploration, discovery, and management in as many regions of the world as we do, they present competition to our metadata business for each of their areas of focus. 
Consumer Electronics 
 Audio. Our audio licensing products face competition from other third-party providers of similar solutions as well as internal engineering and design groups among industry IC provider and consumer electronics manufacturers. 
 Our primary competitor is Dolby Laboratories, which develops and markets, among other things, high‑definition audio products and services. Dolby’s long‑standing market position, brand, business relationships, resources and inclusion in various industry standards provide it with a strong competitive position.
 In addition to Dolby, we compete in specific product markets with companies such as Fraunhofer IIS and various other consumer electronics product manufacturers. Many of these competitors have a wide variety of strengths that afford them competitive advantages, such as longer operating histories, greater resources, greater name recognition, or the ability to offer their technologies for a lower price or for free. We have historically competed effectively against these companies due in part to position our brand as a premium offering that contains superior proprietary technology, the quality of our customer service, our inclusion in industry standards and our industry relationships.
 Connected Car
 Our HD Radio and DTS AutoStage solutions face competition from subscription-based digital service providers such as Sirius/XM, Pandora, Gracenote, and other digital audio and data service providers.
 Our in-cabin monitoring technologies broadly compete with other image processing software vendors targeting the automotive industry, such as SmartEye and Seeing Machines, as well as engineering and design groups of tier one automotive suppliers that seek to provide similar technologies by employing different approaches with their internal teams. 
 Media Platform
 TV Audience Data. We collect and analyze audience research data in an area where companies such as comScore, Inc. and Nielsen Holdings plc and other online data analytics companies compete for research spend from advertisers, advertising agencies and television networks. Other large companies are also focusing resources in this area including Comcast, Meta Platforms Inc. (Facebook) and Alphabet, Inc.’s Google business. Many of our existing customers are investing in platforms to enable their businesses with these capabilities. We believe that there is a significant opportunity for us as an independent data and technology provider, with proprietary access to critical data assets associated with consumers’ engagement with entertainment media.

TiVo Stream 4K. We compete against products with on-demand OTT streaming capabilities offered by internet CE manufacturers.   For example, many CE manufacturers have television or internet-enabled streaming devices for accessing video over the internet such as Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Google Chromecast and Roku. TVs with integrated streaming capabilities from manufacturers such as Samsung, Vizio and LG also represent competition to our Stream 4K.
 Stream OS. We compete for SmartTV platform support with Roku, Alphabet, Inc’s GoogleTV and Amazon’s FireTV. We believe the overall OTT streaming market growth, our differentiated end-user solution, and our more inclusive business model for Tier 2 and Tier 3 SmartTV OEMs represents an opportunity where we can establish a strong niche position.
 In approaching content owners, advertisers and ad agencies to participate in the Stream OS platform, we are competing with the same platforms and TV OEMs operating their own TVOS such as Samsung, Vizio and LG. In this fast-expanding Connected TV advertising market, we believe our cross-platform data insight from Pay-TV and Stream OS households will allow us to create and promote a unique and compelling offering for advertisers.
 Over time, we expect to see new competitors and other competing technologies emerge.
 Intellectual Property Portfolio
 We operate in an industry in which innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are critical for success. We protect our innovations and inventions through a variety of means, including but not limited to applying for patent protection domestically and internationally.
 As of December 31, 2021, we held approximately 5,000 United States issued patents and 1,400 patent applications, as well as approximately 3,900 foreign issued patents and 1,400 patent applications. The last of our currently issued patents to expire is in 2040.
 From time to time, we acquire complementary IP portfolios. Our criteria for patent acquisitions include: compatibility with our existing portfolios, the number and jurisdiction of patent assets, the technical and legal strength of the patents, the actual or likely adoption by industry, and the economic value of the inventions. See Part I, Item 1A- Risk Factors.
 Research & Development
 As demonstrated by our portfolio of industry recognized, widely-deployed advanced technologies and intellectual property (IP), we have a long track record of innovating in the fields of audio, imaging, video discovery, and semiconductors. We believe that ongoing investment in R&D is required for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve. 
 Today, we have a collection of world-class talent and strong research and development capabilities in various locations throughout the world. Starting with core research, machine learning and advanced algorithm development, we continue to focus on IP development and next generation technology solutions. Our ongoing investment in R&D supported by a strong industry network of partners enables us to deliver differentiated, cost-effective solutions that enhance the end-user experience for an ever-larger universe of addressable markets.
 Legislative and Regulatory Actions 
 A number of government and legislative initiatives have been enacted to encourage development and implementation of technologies that protect the rights and intellectual property of the content owners. For example, the U.S. and other countries have adopted certain laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA") and the European Copyright Directive, which are aimed at the prevention of content piracy and the manufacture and sale of products that circumvent copy protection technologies, such as those covered by our patents.
Compatibility Between Cable Systems and CE Equipment
 The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has been working for over a decade to implement a congressional mandate to create a competitive market for cable television STBs and other devices to access video programming on cable systems (“navigation devices”) and give consumers a choice in the devices used to access such programming, while still allowing the cable systems to have control over the secured access to their systems.
 To meet its statutory obligation without compromising the security of video services, the FCC required cable systems to make available a security element (now known as a CableCARD) separate from the basic navigation device needed to access video program channels. In 2003, the FCC adopted regulations implementing an agreement between cable television system operators 
 20


and CE manufacturers to facilitate the retail availability of so-called “plug and play” devices that utilize unidirectional CableCARDs, including digital televisions and other digital devices that enable subscribers to access cable television programming without the need for a STB (but without the ability for consumers to use interactive content). In September 2020, the FCC eliminated rules requiring cable providers to support CableCARD. While the cable industry has continued to provide CableCARDs for third-party devices like ours, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any new technical equipment regulations on our business and operations. Current FCC regulations no longer prohibit multi-channel video service providers from deploying navigation devices with combined security and non-security functions, further developments with respect to these issues could impact the availability and/or demand for “plug and play” devices, particularly bi-directional devices and STBs, all of which could affect demand for UXs incorporated in STBs or CE devices.
 General Government Regulation
 We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies that import or export software and technology, including encryption technology, such as the U.S. export control regulations as administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
 We are also subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws that affect companies conducting business on the internet. In addition, because of the increasing popularity of the internet and the growth of online services, laws relating to user privacy, freedom of expression, content, advertising, accessibility, network neutrality, information security and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world. Each jurisdiction may enact different standards, which could impact our ability to deliver data, services or other solutions through the internet.
 We are subject to international laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation and the Personal Information Protection Law) associated with data protection, privacy, and other aspects of our business in Europe, China and elsewhere and the interpretation and application of data protection laws remains uncertain. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws. Further, the application of existing laws regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers can be unclear. The resulting regulation, if any, may alter our ability to target advertising or provide data about the end-users and/or customers and their behavior.
 Additionally, the privacy regulatory landscape in the U.S. changes rapidly and we may become subject to new privacy or cybersecurity regulations. Such laws and regulations could affect our ability to process personal data (in particular, our ability to use certain data for purposes such as risk or fraud avoidance, marketing or advertising), our ability to control our costs by using certain vendors or service providers or our ability to offer certain services in certain jurisdictions. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered businesses to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and allows for a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA also provides a consumer with the right to (i) opt out of certain sales of personal information, (ii) know the personal information that the business maintains about the consumer, and (iii) request deletion of personal information. It is unclear how the CCPA will be interpreted, but as currently written, it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data. The CCPA’s privacy measures will be strengthened by the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which will become effective on January 1, 2023, with enforcement commencing on July 1, 2023.
 In the U.S., service providers have been subject to claims of defamation, libel, invasion of privacy and other data protection claims, torts, unlawful activity, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted or the content generated by users. In addition, several other federal laws could have an impact on our business. For example, the DMCA has provisions that limit, but do not eliminate, our liability for hosting or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act restricts the ability of service providers to collect information from minors and the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.
 Our operations in China may also be subject to privacy regulations. China recently passed the Personal Information Protection Law effective November 1, 2021, which creates a comprehensive set of data privacy and security obligations that not only apply to the processing of personal information within China, but also to the processing outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, individuals located in China. The law provides for various requirements on personal information protection, including obligations of obtaining informed consent and limiting to the minimum scope necessary for the collection and processing of personal information, requirements for conducting a personal information protection impact assessment for certain data processing activities, and responsibilities of 
 21


adopting necessary measures to safeguard the security of the personal information, etc. The law also requires a security assessment and regulatory approval, government certification and/or conclusion of a standard data transfer agreement with the overseas recipient before transferring personal information outside of China. Lastly, the law imposes significant fines of up to RMB 50 million (approx. $7.7 million) or 5% of annual revenues for violation of the law. Chinese data protection laws are still evolving which may impose additional restrictions on companies doing business in China. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations may likely result in increased costs of doing business.
 Human Capital Resources
 The opportunities for our success and growth depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a talented and engaged workforce. In particular, we are competing for technical talent and we need to offer not only robust and attractive compensation packages but also provide broad opportunities for our employees to make an impact, grow, and develop. As of December 31, 2021, we had a global talent base consisting of approximately 1,900 full-time employees.
 To enable our talent to actively contribute to, and have a positive impact on, the overall business and culture, we developed and maintain a set of programs and initiatives. These programs include competitive compensation and benefits offerings, company culture and employee resource group events, skill development opportunities, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and goal and performance management. In support of these efforts, our Board of Directors monitors many of these programs and initiatives and provides guidance and feedback as appropriate. Our goal is to provide a work environment that empowers our teams and enables employees to enjoy a healthy and productive work-life balance for themselves, their families, and our community. 
 Our incentives are based on merits, and we have a strong pay-for-performance culture. We benchmark our total rewards annually to ensure our compensation and benefit programs remain competitive with industry peers. Our compensation framework for employees reflects a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonuses, performance awards, and stock-based compensation. We offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to meet or exceed local laws and that are competitive in the marketplace. 
 We invest in the career growth of our employees by providing a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face (where possible), virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, training and external development. We also conduct annual assessment of employees to identify development needs based on department goals. We believe in the principles of a learning organization and strive to provide continuous educational opportunities for our employees. In 2021, we curated and delivered courses through our online learning platform, providing a wide range of skill development opportunities for employees to become more knowledgeable and effective in their roles. 
 We leverage our manager ecosystem, coupled with industry-standard performance management tools, to align corporate goals with employee objectives. We have delivered management training and supplementary resources to enable our management community to provide excellent support and guidance to their teams. We have recently launched ongoing People Management Community sessions and a Manager Resources Hub, which serves as a one-stop shop for managers. Employees are encouraged to create and align individual, functional and team-based goals, track performance against goals, write self-evaluations, and provide feedback to supervisors or management members.
 We have demonstrated support and commitment to developing a culture of non-discrimination and embracing diversity and inclusion throughout our workforce.  Our current employee resource groups represent the LGBTQ+ community, the black community, women, and veterans. We also have formed a Diversity and Inclusion council comprised of all levels of employees and senior executives. The purpose of the council is, among other things, to identify and address issues of diversity and inclusion through multiple and unique perspectives from a diverse group of our employees. We continue to be a part of the business coalition in support of the Equality Act, a measure that supports federal legislation that would provide the same basic protections to LGBTQ+ people as are provided to other protected groups under federal law. Additionally, we currently comply fully with California’s board diversity legislation that requires a minimum number of female directors and directors from underrepresented communities.
 We measure employee experience by collecting insight and understanding of engagement and satisfaction. We use an employee engagement survey, executive roundtables, and employee focus groups to solicit input.
 During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We have:
  
• | Established office reentry guidelines consistent with CDC, state and local government mandates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developed a hybrid-work model methodology and implemented a consultative approach with our employees around the flexible work arrangements that they need in order to maintain productivity and their health and well-being.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Offered various training and learning opportunities, including relevant trainings to help employees better manage remote working, childcare, social isolation, and other work-from-home challenges.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced internal communications strategies using multiple vehicles such as a corporate intranet, Zoom, Slack, videos, etc., to ensure connection and contacts among employees.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provided a number of well-being offerings and events including resources and guidance on burn-out, access to Headspace (a mindfulness app), and various online training events.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extended our Working From Home Connectivity Allowance and New Hire WFH Allowance, which covers certain costs associated with setting up home offices, into 2022.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any organized work stoppages, and we consider the relationships with our employees to be positive.
 Climate Change
 We published our first ESG report on February 7, 2022 which can be found at https://3tzoo1wg2mg2h6j5g2fflok1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ESG_Report_February_2022.pdf. Using insights we gleaned from the development of our inaugural materiality assessment, we developed an ESG program around three key focus areas: Culture & Belonging, Community Impact, and Resilience. Our Resilience pillar includes a focus on reducing the impact of climate change. We have already taken steps to reduce our carbon footprint through actions such as increasing energy efficiency within our office buildings and reducing and migrating the majority of on-premise IT assets towards more energy efficient solutions. At the beginning of 2022, we began the exercise of measuring our greenhouse gas baseline emissions and will establish associated goals linked to that activity, and we intend to present those goals in a subsequent ESG report.
