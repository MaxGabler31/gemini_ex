Summary Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully in Part I, Item 1A., "Risk Factors" herein. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
•We have incurred significant losses in recent years, expect to incur significant net losses in the foreseeable future and may never become profitable.
•We have limited sources of revenue and our success is dependent on our ability to develop our DNA vaccines, DNA immunotherapies, dMAbs and electroporation equipment.
•We will need substantial additional capital to develop our DNA vaccines, DNA immunotherapies and dMAb programs and electroporation delivery technology. 
•None of our human vaccine candidates, including INO-4800, or our immunotherapy and DNA encoded monoclonal antibody product candidates have been approved for sale, and we may never develop commercially successful vaccine, immunotherapy or DNA encoded monoclonal antibody products.
•The Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant and newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants will likely require us to modify our COVID-19 vaccine strategy, which will result in new and added risks, including whether there will continue to be a need for a COVID-19 vaccine.
•There can be no assurance that any of the products we are developing for COVID-19 would be granted an Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA or similar authorization by regulatory authorities outside of the United States if we were to decide to apply for such an authorization. The option of seeking an Emergency Use Authorization may no longer exist for our primary vaccine candidates, and if we cannot obtain such authorization or, if granted, it is terminated, we will be unable to sell our product in the near future and instead will be required to pursue the biologic licensure process in order to sell our product, which is lengthy and expensive.
•If we and the contract manufacturers upon whom we rely fail to produce our electroporation devices and product candidates in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or at all, or fail to comply with their obligations to us or with stringent regulations, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of our electroporation equipment and product candidates.
•If we lose or are unable to secure collaborators or partners, or if our collaborators or partners do not apply adequate resources to their relationships with us, our product development and potential for profitability will suffer.
•We have agreements with government agencies, which are subject to termination and uncertain future funding.
•Our participation in the WHO Solidarity Trial Vaccines (STV) could result in adverse consequences. We do not have any control over clinical data, progress, and decisions regarding INO-4800's participation in STV, and as such, decisions regarding the clinical pathway for INO-4800 between the WHO and the Company may not always align.
•We are currently subject to litigation and may become subject to additional litigation, which could harm our business, financial condition and reputation. 
•We face intense and increasing competition and steps taken by of our competitors, such as the introduction of a new, disruptive technology, may impede our ability to successfully commercialize our DNA medicines.
•It is difficult and costly to generate and protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies, and we may not be able to ensure their protection. 
•If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Company Overview
We are a biotechnology company focused on bringing to market precisely designed DNA medicines and vaccines to help protect people from infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and to help treat people with cancer, and conditions associated with human papillomavirus ("HPV"). We have shown in clinical trials that our DNA vaccine candidates can be delivered into cells in the body via a proprietary smart device allowing the nucleic-acid delivered gene products to activate functional T cell and antibody responses against targeted pathogens and cancers.
Our DNA medicines pipeline is comprised of three types of product candidates: prophylactic DNA vaccines, therapeutic DNA immunotherapies, and DNA encoded monoclonal and bispecific antibodies ("dMAbs" and “dBTAs”), all of which utilize the two components of our integrated platform, SynCon® and CELLECTRA®.
Our proprietary SynCon® technology creates optimized plasmids, which are circular strands of DNA that instruct a cell to produce proteins or antigens to help the person’s immune system respond with antibodies and immune cells which recognize and then help block viruses and destroy cancerous or pre-cancerous cells. 
Our patented CELLECTRA® smart delivery devices facilitate uptake of our DNA medicines into the cell, which has been a key limitation of historical DNA-based technology approaches. Human clinical trial data from more than 15,000 CELLECTRA® smart device administrations across more than 5,000 participants to date have shown a tolerable safety profile.
Our corporate strategy is to develop, seek regulatory approval for, and commercialize our novel DNA medicines to address unmet global health needs. We continue to advance and clinically validate an array of DNA medicine candidates that target infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, as well as HPV-associated diseases and cancer. We aim to advance our product candidates through commercialization and, where applicable, with third-party resources through collaborations and partnerships, including product license agreements.
Our partners and collaborators include ApolloBio Corporation, AstraZeneca, Advaccine Biopharmaceuticals Suzhou Co, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ("CEPI"), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ("DARPA"), The U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), HIV Vaccines Trial Network, the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s Medical CBRN Defense Consortium ("MCDC"), International Vaccine Institute ("IVI"), Kaneka Eurogentec, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Ology Bioservices, the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Plumbline Life Sciences, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Richter-Helm BioLogics, Thermo Fisher Scientific, the University of Pennsylvania, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and The Wistar Institute. 
We or our collaborators are currently evaluating the feasibility of, conducting or planning clinical studies of our DNA medicines for COVID-19, which includes both homologous and heterologous boosting approaches; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS; Lassa fever; Ebola; as well as HPV-associated precancers, including cervical, vulvar, and anal dysplasia; HPV-associated cancers, including head & neck, cervical, anal, penile, vulvar, and vaginal; other HPV-associated disorders, such as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, or RRP; glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM; and prostate cancer. 
Our DNA Medicines Platform 
Overview of Our Platform 
Our proprietary design and optimization process for our DNA plasmids is called SynCon®. These plasmids are delivered into cells intramuscularly or intradermally via our proprietary CELLECTRA® smart devices, which use brief electrical pulses to reversibly open small pores in the cell, enabling DNA plasmids to enter. Once inside the cell, the plasmids instruct the body’s cellular machinery to produce the target antigen or monoclonal antibody. We believe our DNA medicines platform offers 
versatile capabilities, both in terms of addressing several disease targets as well as providing us with several product development opportunities.
The characteristics and core components of our DNA medicines platform include:
1. SynCon Design Process: SynCon uses a proprietary computer algorithm that has been designed to identify and optimize the DNA sequence of the target antigen, whether it is from a virus or a tumor.
2. CELLECTRA Smart Device: Once our DNA medicines are injected, the DNA medicines instruct the cell to produce the target antigen, monoclonal antibody, or therapeutic protein. The antigens are then processed naturally in the cell and induce the immune system to generate antibodies and T cells that perform preventive or therapeutic functions. Similarly, dMAbs® or dBTAs generated in this manner can also trigger desired immune system functions. 
3. Our DNA medicines have generated in vivo (within the body) immune responses: With our core platform technology, we have developed a pipeline of clinical-stage product candidates that have generated in vivo immune responses, in particular CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that may be responsible for eliminating cancerous or infected cells.
4. Our DNA medicines work naturally with the immune system: Compared to some other technologies, our DNA medicines are designed to work with the immune system with reduced risk of unwanted inflammatory responses.
The mechanism of action for our DNA medicines and the process for administration of our DNA medicines are summarized in the following graphic: 
Nucleic Acid Vaccines: Similarities and Differences between DNA and mRNA-based Approaches 
The use of nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA or mRNA) as an alternative to traditional immunization is a strategy that has been under development for many years. We believe that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval for emergency use authorization (EUA) of two messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines for COVID-19 in 2020, as well as an EUA by Indian regulators for a DNA vaccine in 2021, suggests the benefit of using nucleic acids as vaccines.
Over the past decade, the scientific community and the vaccine industry have been asked to respond urgently to various epidemics, including but not limited to: H1N1 influenza, Ebola, Zika virus and, most recently, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Today, multiple platforms have been used or are under development in the fight against COVID-19. Among those are DNA- and mRNA-based platforms, along with those developing viral vector and recombinant-subunit vaccines.
Our efforts to develop a DNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19 is based on the suitability and scalability of our DNA medicines platform, as well as our track record of generating clinical candidates to combat pandemic threats such as Ebola, Zika 
virus, and Lassa Fever. We were the first company to advance a vaccine against MERS-CoV, a related coronavirus, into clinical evaluation in humans.
Our DNA Medicines’ Differentiation from mRNA
While DNA and mRNA both use fragments of genetic materials that, once injected, instruct the body to fight pathogens, which cause cancer and infectious disease, there are key differentiating features of DNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines require colder storage temperature for transportation, necessitate complex LNP formulations for scaling, and are on average more expensive when considering manufacturing and distribution. We believe that our DNA vaccines offer several key potential advantages: 
a.Tolerability: Our DNA vaccines appear to be well-tolerated when evaluated against multiple disease targets. 
b.Stability of Product: Our DNA vaccines are stable for more than a year at room temperature or for more than a month at 37º C, have a five-year projected shelf life at normal refrigeration temperature and do not require frozen cold storage or shipping. 
c.Rapid Design and Manufacture: Similar to mRNA vaccines, our DNA vaccines can be rapidly designed and scaled, which are critical aspects in addressing global pandemics like COVID-19. 
d.T Cell Responses: Our DNA vaccines have demonstrated the ability to generate high levels of T cell (CD4+ and CD8+) responses along with antibody responses. The CD8+ T cell responses, in particular, are regarded to be very important in their propensity to clear tumor cells in the body as well as to fight off infections. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, CD8+ T cells generated by our vaccine resemble those that the scientific and medical community have profiled and associated with mild COVID illness as opposed to severe illness, as well as convalescence. Furthermore, cellular responses have been preserved across different variants of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that INO-4800 can elicit a cross-reactive immune profile.
e.Ability to Readminister: Our DNA vaccines have been used in clinical trials to boost our vaccines’ immunity profile via repeat administration, suggesting that our DNA vaccines could be readministered if immunity wanes, offering the possibility for seasonal boosting usage without any concerns of generating an anti-vector response. 
Our DNA Medicines Platform in Detail
The goal of our DNA medicines platform is to generate and deliver safe and effective therapeutics and preventive vaccines. Our technologies allow us to enable in vivo generation of functional immune responses to achieve desired therapeutic and preventive outcomes. Historically, we have focused primarily on in vivo production of disease-specific antigens in order to stimulate prophylactic or therapeutic immune responses. More recently, we have explored an additional new application for the platform: in vivo generation of monoclonal antibodies to achieve preventive and therapeutic outcomes complementary to our antigen-generating immunotherapies.
There are two components to our DNA medicines platform. The first is a biological component (SynCon), by which we encode proteins (antigens, monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, and cytokines such as IL-12) into closed-circular DNA plasmids that are translated into proteins that are expressed to generate an immune response. The second component is our proprietary CELLECTRA smart devices technology, which facilitates delivery of the DNA plasmids. 
The resulting immune responses from DNA medicine administration are designed to neutralize or eliminate infectious agents, such as viruses, bacteria, and other microorganisms, or abnormal cells, such as malignant tumors or infected cells. T cells can be “trafficked” to parts of the body where cells are displaying the target antigen. Memory cells are also created for durable effects. 
SynCon® DNA Medicines Design 
Our SynCon DNA medicines are designed to generate antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses. Based on extensive due diligence and pre-clinical and clinical data that we have evaluated, we first identify one or more antigens that we believe are the best targets, for directing the immune system toward a particular cancer or infectious disease. We then apply our SynCon design process, which uses the genetic make-up of the selected antigens from multiple variants of a cancer or strains of a virus. 
For each antigen, we create a new genetic sequence that represents a nucleotide consensus sequence of the targeted antigen from multiple virus variants or strains. We can create a differentiated SynCon sequence to help the immune system better recognize a cancer self-antigen (from a cancerous cell grown in the body) and “break the tolerance” of those cancer cells within the body. We have generated immune responses with SynCon DNA medicines against different strains of certain infectious diseases in human clinical trials. Because the engineered SynCon sequences are substantially similar to the original sequences, without matching them exactly we believe they are patentable.
Once a SynCon sequence is engineered, it is then inserted into a circular DNA plasmid with its own promoter. The plasmid is optimized at the DNA level for codon usage and improved stability of mRNA and provided with enhanced and proprietary leader sequences for ribosome loading. It is optimized at the genetic level to enable high expression in human cells. We believe these design capabilities allow us to better target appropriate immune system mechanisms and produce a higher level of the coded antigen compared to traditional approaches, potentially enhancing the overall ability of the immunotherapy to induce the desired immune response. 
The plasmids are then manufactured in a bacterial fermentation process using scalable manufacturing technology. Ultimately, the manufactured DNA medicines are designed to be stable under normal environmental conditions for extended periods of time. 
Our DNA medicines platform allows for rapid design, pre-clinical testing, manufacturing at scale, and clinical development of both our DNA vaccine and DNA immunotherapy product candidates. Speed is an important feature, particularly as it relates to developing a response to globally emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Responses to emerging infectious diseases that we have explored are described in more detail below.
CELLECTRA® Delivery Technology 
Our DNA medicines are delivered directly into cells of the body intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID) in a small, localized area of tissue using our proprietary CELLECTRA smart devices. CELLECTRA smart devices use brief electrical pulses to reversibly open small pores in the cell, enabling DNA plasmids to enter. Through this process, the cellular uptake of the DNA plasmids increases by more than 1,000-fold compared to the injection of a DNA plasmid alone without this delivery mechanism. This improved cellular uptake has enabled the immune responses observed in our clinical trials along with the efficacy results generated by these immune responses. 
Our CELLECTRA portfolio consists of three devices. CELLECTRA 2000 is our clinical device that can perform both IM and ID injections. CELLECTRA 2000 has been used in almost all clinical trials to date. CELLECTRA 5PSP is our new IM device utilizing a prefilled drug CELLECTRA 5PSP is used in our Phase 3 (REVEAL1/REVEAL2) trials for cervical high squamous epithelial lesions (HSIL). Finally, CELLECTRA 3PSP is our next generation ID delivery device.
Alternative delivery approaches which typically involve or rely on virus-based vectors, bacteria, nanoparticles and lipids may be complex and expensive and, in some cases, may raise safety concerns. For example, because alternative delivery vectors themselves may possess additional antigens specific to the vector, they can attract unwanted immune responses that could compromise the vectors’ ability to deliver their genetic “payload” and produce the desired immune response. In contrast, a DNA plasmid vector possesses no antigens of its own, as the plasmid results in production of only the target antigen. 
We have published preclinical data in which we observed improved immune responses generated by our SynCon® DNA medicines delivered using CELLECTRA smart devices compared to a viral vector-based approach (Adenovirus type 5). The delivery of DNA medicines using CELLECTRA smart devices to date has shown a favorable tolerability and safety profile in clinical trials. Our CELLECTRA-based approach is designed to be tolerable without the need for an anesthetic. 
There are several configurations in the CELLECTRA smart device family. The first configuration covers intramuscular (IM) delivery, while the second covers intradermal/subcutaneous (ID) delivery. Smart devices with these configurations have been validated, manufactured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and are being used in human clinical trials. We have filed device master files with the FDA covering the use of the CELLECTRA smart devices in human clinical trials.
Our CELLECTRA smart devices combine the functionality of our current generation of ID and IM devices in clinical testing with enhanced form, design and portability. All components of the pulse generator and applicator are integrated into a cordless, rechargeable device. The rechargeable battery can enable immunization of several hundred participants, making the device useful for mass vaccinations. The devices are designed to accommodate different electrode arrays to meet the requirements of the particular DNA medicine and targeted tissue for delivery. 
Next-Generation Smart Device Development 
We are also advancing a new generation of small, portable, battery-powered ID delivery devices called CELLECTRA®-3PSP. Currently used ID devices penetrate no more than 3 mm into the target tissue, compared to IM devices that go deeper.
The medical arm of the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) agreed to fund the further development of our CELLECTRA-3PSP device. DTRA provided $8.14 million of grant funding to support the development of CELLECTRA-3PSP, to be used in the administration of our vaccines and therapies, including DTRA-developed products.
In June 2020 we were awarded funding expected to be approximately $65.2 million from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to support the large-scale manufacture of the CELLECTRA-3PSP smart device, the production of doses and the procurement of CELLECTRA 2000 devices. The DoD contract, from the JPEO-CRBND-EB through funding provided by the 
Defense Health Program, builds upon two separate prior $5 million grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and CEPI, to accelerate the testing of CELLECTRA-3PSP. 
Background on DNA Medicines and Immuno-Oncology 
Multiple technology advancements and product approvals have demonstrated the ability of immunotherapies to treat cancer. Monoclonal antibodies such as Herceptin® (anti-HER2) and its analogs have demonstrated therapeutic benefit in clinical trials and have been approved for use in a variety of cancers. While a significant step forward, monoclonal antibodies with ideal clinical characteristics have been difficult to design or identify and are expensive to produce, and the technology does not lend itself to designing mAbs for many diseases. Dendritic, or other cell-based therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, are highly personalized medicines involving removing cells from the patient, modifying, manipulating and multiplying them, and then returning them to the body, which can be complex and costly.
Progress in the field of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has resulted in optimism regarding the potential for new immunotherapies against a spectrum of cancers, specifically solid tumors, where cell-based therapies have not previously succeeded. The immune system relies on checkpoint mechanisms to prevent excessive or incorrectly directed immune responses. Many cancer cells can “hijack” these checkpoints and neutralize T cells sent by the immune system to eliminate them. ICIs prevent cancer cells from interfering with these safeguards and enable T cells (especially CD8+ killer T cells) to complete their killing function against cancer cells. Clinical trials of ICIs have shown notable therapeutic impact against many cancers and have led to several approvals. However, ICIs may be less effective if there is not a high enough pre-existing level of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the tumor micro-environment, meaning that the tumor is “cold” rather than “hot” (with a significant level of CD8+ T cells). More recently, scientists have recognized that T cell-generating “active” immunotherapies may be able to transform a "cold" tumor into a "hot" tumor and in combination with ICIs may possess significant therapeutic potential to fight cancers. 
More recently, a new category of immunotherapies called adoptive cell transfer, for example CAR-T technology, has provided further evidence of the merit of providing an enhanced T cell presence to fight cancer. CAR-T therapies have achieved dramatic results, most notably in B cell cancers. Unfortunately, they have also been associated with significant side effects. Additionally, these complex therapeutic products need to be manufactured and released for each patient, leading to expensive and timely manufacturing, as well as increased supply chain complexity. 
While there have been significant clinical advances in recent years that better harness or activate capable killer T cells, we believe there is still significant potential to develop additional immunotherapies to fight cancers and infectious diseases. 
We seek to advance product candidates that: 
•Target disease-specific antigens or proteins unique to a cancer or infectious disease; 
•Do not depend on complex manufacturing processes; 
•Activate functional killer T cells; 
•Generate robust T cell responses or a significant number of T cells that are persistent and durable over time (memory response); 
•Do not induce toxic inflammatory responses; and 
•Are capable of “breaking tolerance” of cancer cells in the body. 
Data from our Phase 2b and REVEAL1 Phase 3 trial of VGX-3100, discussed below, suggest that our approach to activating significant antigen-targeted T cells may achieve these characteristics. Accordingly, we are advancing a pipeline of pre-clinical and clinical immunotherapy product candidates. 
Our DNA Medicines in Development
 The chart below summarizes the status of our active DNA medicines development programs, each of which is described in more detail following the chart. 
VGX-3100 for the Treatment of HPV-Associated Precancerous Lesions
Overview and Background
Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a sexually-transmitted, persistent viral infection with one or more high-risk (HR) genotypes that can lead to pre-cancers and cancers, such as cervical, head and neck, anal and vulvar dysplasia and cancer. It is estimated that approximately 43% of the U.S. adult population is infected with HPV, and about 25% of adult men and 20% of adult women in the U.S. have a genital infection with one or more HR-HPV genotypes such as HPV-16 and HPV-18. HPV is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract and HPV-16 and HPV-18 infections specifically are the major causes of cervical cancers globally. Almost 300 million women globally are estimated to be infected with HPV, with another 30 million additional cases that have progressed to the pre-cancerous stage. While most genital HPV infections are cleared naturally by the body's own immune system, persistent cervical infection with one or more HR-HPV genotypes can eventually lead to cervical high-grade dysplasia (HSIL) and eventually to cervical cancer. Researchers have estimated the global prevalence of clinically pre-cancerous cervical HSILs at between 28 and 40 million.
Current management options for cervical HSIL are limited and are associated with potential unwanted side effects. The “watch-and-wait” process associated with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL, formerly called low-grade dysplasia or CIN 1) and in some young women with higher grade lesions (though only for the CIN 2 level of cervical HSIL) can be a stressful approach. The only available current treatment option for cervical HSIL is surgery, which involves ablating or cutting into a women’s cervix to remove the pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions. These treatments may lead to short-term adverse effects including cervical scarring, excess bleeding, and infection, or to longer-term reproductive risks such as pre-term birth, miscarriage, and perhaps infertility. More importantly, because surgery does not clear the underlying systemic HPV infection, there is a chance of high-grade pre-cancer lesion recurrence after surgery as a result of persistent HPV infection and/or incomplete removal of the lesion. 
While there is currently a vaccine available to prevent HPV infection, challenges with acceptance, accessibility and compliance of vaccines to prevent HPV infection and their resulting pre-cancers and cancers have resulted in many vaccine-eligible people remaining unvaccinated and at risk; it is estimated that even in the United States, only 60% of the eligible population has been vaccinated against HPV. In addition, preventive HPV vaccines cannot treat or protect those already infected with the same HPV genotypes, which is a large population. Currently there is no viable immunotherapy or drug available to fight incident, prevalent, or persistent HPV infection or to treat cervical HSIL. We therefore believe that there is a significant market opportunity for our therapeutic product candidate VGX-3100. 
VGX-3100 is designed to increase T cell immune responses against the E6 and E7 oncogenic proteins of high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 that can be present in both precancerous and cancerous cells transformed by these HPV types. E6 and E7 are oncogenes that play an integral role in transforming HPV-infected cells into precancerous and cancerous cells, thus making them appealing targets for T cell directed immunotherapy. The goal of VGX-3100 is to stimulate the body's immune system to 
generate a T cell response strong enough to kill the cells producing the E6/E7 protein. The potential of such an immunotherapy would be to treat HSIL caused by these HPV types. 
VGX-3100 for the Treatment of Cervical HSIL
We have completed randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials of VGX-3100 compared to placebo, in women with HPV-16 and HPV-18 cervical HSIL. Data from the Phase 2b trial supported our Phase 3 development program; in the Phase 2b trial, women treated with VGX-3100 were more likely to demonstrate resolution of cervical HSIL and HPV clearance from cervical lesions than those women receiving placebo. In addition, antigen-specific T cell levels in women treated with VGX-3100 were greater than those treated with placebo. All women were monitored for an additional 52 weeks following the primary endpoint to assess for safety; VGX-3100 was considered to be well-tolerated and there were no safety concerns observed. Immune endpoints were also assessed and women whose lesions regressed also had higher frequencies of HPV-specific CD8+ T cells which co-expressed key molecules important in the T cell killing cascade and directly correlated with clinical efficacy. To our knowledge, this Phase 2b trial was the first study from which data was published indicating a direct correlation between antigen-specific CD8+ T cells generated in vivo and clinical efficacy.
Phase 3 Trials (REVEAL1 and REVEAL2)
In preparation for Phase 3 development and potential commercialization, we completed a manufacturing technology-transfer to a commercial manufacturing facility and scaled up manufacturing of VGX-3100. 
We also designed and manufactured a new smart delivery device, CELLECTRA®-5PSP, which is being used in our global Phase 3 clinical trial of VGX-3100. This smart device uses a cordless applicator and charges cordlessly in an improved base station that has been optimized for ease of use in the clinic.
Our Phase 3 program, named REVEAL, consists of a primary trial (REVEAL1; HPV-301) and confirmatory trial (REVEAL2; HPV-303), being conducted in parallel. The REVEAL trials are prospective, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating adult women with HPV 16/18 positive biopsy-proven cervical HSIL (CIN 2/3). The primary endpoint is regression of cervical HSIL and virologic clearance of HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 in the cervix, which was a secondary endpoint that was achieved in our Phase 2b trial. Overall, the Phase 3 trials are evaluating cervical tissue changes at approximately 9 months after beginning a three-dose regimen of VGX-3100 administered at months 0, 1 and 3.
In March 2021, we announced the result of the REVEAL1 trial of VGX-3100. The trial protocol-defined intention to treat (ITT) population (N=201) includes all randomized participants regardless of availability of endpoint data and defines those without endpoint data as non-responders. There were eight such participants (seven in the treatment group, one in the placebo group) in the ITT population. Including participants with missing endpoint data, the percentage of participants meeting the primary endpoint was 22.5% (31/138) in the treatment group, versus 11.1% (7/63) in the placebo group (p=0.029; 95%CI: -0.4,21.2), which was not statistically significant. All secondary endpoints were achieved except for regression of cervical HSIL alone (95%CI: -0.6,24.5). 
For the protocol-defined mITT population (N=193) which includes all participants with endpoint data, we announced that VGX-3100 had achieved the primary and secondary endpoints among all evaluable participants. For the primary endpoint of histopathological regression of HSIL and virologic clearance of HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 at week 36, the percentage of responders was 23.7% (31/131) in the treatment group, versus 11.3% (7/62) in the placebo group (p=0.022; 95%CI: 0.4,22.5), thus achieving statistical significance. All secondary efficacy endpoints were achieved in this population. These endpoints were: a) regression of cervical HSIL to normal tissue combined with HPV16/18 viral clearance, b) regression of cervical HSIL alone, c) regression of cervical HSIL to normal tissue, and d) HPV 16/18 viral clearance alone. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and most adverse events (AEs) were self-resolving and were considered to be mild to moderate, consistent with earlier clinical trials. These data were presented at the 2021 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical (ASCCP) annual scientific meeting, and at the 34th International Papillomavirus Conference (IPVC) in November 2021.
We completed the 52-week safety follow-up of participants in REVEAL1 and showed that VGX-3100 remained well-tolerated through Week 88. In addition, participants treated with VGX-3100 who met the primary endpoint at Week 36 remained clear of HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 at Week 88.
REVEAL2 is the second of two Phase 3 trials and the confirmatory trial agreed upon by INOVIO and FDA. Endpoints for REVEAL2 are identical to those for REVEAL1; participants will be followed for up to 40 weeks. Enrollment of REVEAL2 was completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Top-line efficacy and safety data are expected to be available in the second half of 2022. 
VGX-3100 for the Treatment of Vulvar HSIL
HPV-16 and HPV-18 can cause precancerous and cancerous lesions of the vulva. These precancerous lesions, or vulvar HSIL, have less than a 5% rate of spontaneous or natural regression and there are no FDA-approved non-surgical treatments. Surgery, the most common treatment, is associated with high rates of disease recurrence and can cause disfigurement, long-term 
pain, and psychological distress for women who undergo the procedure. Vulvar HSIL recurs in approximately one-half of patients who undergo surgical treatment. 
We have also completed a Phase 2 trial (HPV-201) to evaluate the efficacy of VGX-3100 in participants with vulvar HSIL. This randomized, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial assessed the efficacy of VGX-3100 in 33 women with vulvar HSIL. VGX-3100 was administered with our CELLECTRA® -5PSP smart device. The primary endpoint of the trial was histologic clearance of high-grade lesions and virologic clearance of the HPV virus in vulvar tissue samples. The trial also evaluated the safety and tolerability of VGX-3100. In January 2021, we announced positive efficacy results from this trial. A 25% or more reduction in HPV-16/18-associated vulvar HSIL was observed for 63% of trial participants (12 of 19) treated with VGX-3100 at six months post-treatment. Three of the 20 participants with histology data (15%) resolved their vulvar HSIL and had no HPV-16/18 virus detectable in the healed area. VGX-3100 was well-tolerated in the Phase 2 trial.
We are evaluating future clinical steps for the vulvar HSIL program, including the potential for applying for U.S. FDA Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for this indication. ODD is intended to encourage drug development for rare diseases by providing tax credits for qualified clinical trials, an exemption from user fees related to the New Drug Application or Biological License Application, and a potential of up to seven years of market exclusivity after approval. The FDA grants orphan drug status to medicines intended for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of rare diseases or conditions, as defined as a disease or condition with a prevalence of less than 200,000 patients in the United States annually.
VGX-3100 for the Treatment of Anal or Perianal HSIL 
HPV-16 and HPV-18 can also cause precancerous lesions of the anus (anal HSIL). Left untreated, anal HSIL may progress to cancer. Spontaneous regression of anal HSIL is observed in approximately 20% of patients. Persistent infection with one or more high-risk HPV genotypes is responsible for a large portion of anal cancer. In the United States, about 55% to 80% of anal HSIL cases are associated with HPV-16/18, and worldwide about 80% of anal HSIL cases are associated with HPV-16/18. In the United States, over 90% of anal cancer is attributable to HPV, and about 87% of those HPV anal cancers are attributable to HPV-16/18 specifically. 
There are no validated screening tests or a general screening recommendation consensus for anal HSIL. Treatment usually consists of repeated ablation, most commonly radiofrequency ablation (RFA), resections or laser therapy. However, recurrence rates are high, up to 49% one year after treatment, resulting in an unmet medical need. 
We have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial (HPV-203) to evaluate VGX-3100 in participants who are HIV-negative with histologically confirmed anal or perianal HSIL, or anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18. This open-label trial enrolled 24 participants who received three doses of VGX-3100 delivered by our CELLECTRA®-5PSP device. The primary endpoint of the trial was histologic clearance of the high-grade lesions and virologic clearance of the HPV-16/18 virus in anal/perianal tissue samples. In December 2020, we announced positive Phase 2 efficacy results from this trial. One-half of participants treated with VGX-3100 (11/22) showed resolution of HPV-16/18-associated anal HSIL at six months following the start of treatment. VGX-3100 was well-tolerated in the trial. We plan to pursue a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial for HPV-16-/18-associated anal HSIL as well as to apply for ODD from the U.S. FDA.
In addition to the Phase 2 anal HSIL trial sponsored by us, a separate ongoing Phase 2 trial sponsored by the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC-103) is evaluating VGX-3100 in participants with histologically confirmed anal or perianal HSIL associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 who are HIV-positive. This open-label single-arm trial plans to enroll approximately 75 participants who will receive up to four doses of VGX-3100 delivered by CELLECTRA®-5PSP smart device. The primary endpoint of the trial is histological regression of high-grade anal lesions to low-grade SIL or normal histology.
VGX-3100 Immune Correlates and Biomarker Signatures 
We are pursuing a biomarker signature for our VGX-3100 program. In May 2019, we entered into a collaboration with QIAGEN N.V. to co-develop a liquid biopsy-based diagnostic for this biomarker signature to identify women with HPV-16/18 cervical HSIL most likely to respond to VGX-3100. In February 2021, we announced an extension of our partnership with QIAGEN with a new master collaboration agreement to develop liquid biopsy-based companion diagnostic products based on next-generation sequencing technology to complement our therapies. QIAGEN is utilizing the Illumina NextSeq™ 550Dx platform for this biomarker, the first development based on a partnership QIAGEN and Illumina signed in October 2019. 
In December 2021, we announced that we and QIAGEN have identified candidate biomarker signatures for VGX-3100 with the intent of selecting a final signature of a pre-treatment in vitro diagnostic to meet the specific characteristics desired to identify women with HPV-16/18 cervical HSIL most likely to respond to VGX-3100. This biomarker, if validated, may have the potential to identify those women who are more likely to have a favorable treatment outcome, specifically the regression of cervical HSIL and clearance of virus.
ApolloBio Collaboration Agreement for VGX-3100 within Greater China 
In 2017, we entered into an agreement providing ApolloBio Corporation with the exclusive right to develop and commercialize VGX-3100 within Greater China (defined as China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan). Additional details on the 
ApolloBio Agreement are provided below under "License, Collaboration and Supply Agreements." In December 2021, ApolloBio dosed its first participant in a separate Phase 3 trial in China (HPV-303CHN). 
INO-3107 for the Treatment of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)
RRP is a rare disease (estimated at about 7,000 active prevalent cases in the United States in 2018, including both juvenile and adult cases) that is characterized by the growth of tumors in the respiratory tract primarily caused by HPV-6 and/or HPV-11 genotypes. Although mostly benign, such papillomas can cause severe, sometimes life-threatening airway obstruction and respiratory complications. A distinguishing aspect of this disease is the tendency for the papilloma to recur after surgical procedures to remove them. If RRP develops in the lungs, affected individuals can potentially experience recurrent pneumonia, chronic lung disease (bronchiectasis) and, ultimately, progressive pulmonary failure. In extremely rare cases (less than 1%), RRP can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. Additional symptoms of RRP can include hoarse voice, difficulty in sleeping and swallowing, and chronic coughing. RRP symptoms are usually more severe in children than in adults. In children, the disorder is most often diagnosed at or around the age of four years. In adults, the disorder occurs most often in the third or fourth decade, though evidence exists for some incidence of new diagnoses in the sixth decade. 
In February 2020, we commenced an open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 trial that is evaluating the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of INO-3107, a DNA medicine candidate similar to INO-3106, but targeting HPV-6 and HPV-11 associated RRP and including INO-9112, encoding IL-12, in participants with HPV-6 and/or HPV-11-associated RRP. For this trial, adult participants will first undergo surgical removal of their papilloma(s) and then receive up to four doses of INO-3107, once every three weeks. The primary endpoint of this trial is safety and tolerability. The trial is also assessing efficacy as a function of the number of treatments required to treat RRP relative to the number of treatments required to control disease prior to enrollment in the trial. We began enrollment in November 2020, and completed enrollment of the first 32 participants in December 2021. All 32 adult participants first underwent surgical removal of their papilloma(s) and then received four doses of INO-3107, one every three weeks. We expect preliminary efficacy data from a portion of participants from this Phase 1/2 trial in the second half of 2022.
In July 2020, we announced that the U.S. FDA granted ODD for INO-3107. 
INO-5401 for the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) 
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive type of brain cancer. In the United States, the median age at diagnosis is 65 years, and the incidence rate increases thereafter. Prognosis is extremely poor, and a limited number of new therapies have been approved over the last 10 years; median overall survival for U.S. patients receiving standard of care therapy was approximately eight months and the five-year survival was 6.8% for all ages combined. The annual incidence of GBM is estimated to be approximately 12,000 cases per year and increasing. 
Our product candidate INO-5401 is an immunotherapy consisting of three synthetic DNA plasmids encoding for three tumor-associated antigens: human telomerase (hTERT), Wilms tumor gene-1 (WT1) and PSMA. The National Cancer Institute previously highlighted WT1, hTERT and PSMA among a list of important cancer antigens, designating them as high priorities for cancer immunotherapy development, as these three tumor-associated antigens are commonly expressed in human cancers.
In 2017, we reported data indicating that our SynCon® WT1 cancer antigen was capable of breaking immune tolerance, a major challenge to researchers striving to develop potent cancer therapies and induced neo-antigen-like T cell responses to cause tumor regression in pre-clinical studies. The results were published in the scientific journal Molecular Therapy. 
While mice in the preclinical study did not mount an immune response to native mouse WT1 antigens, mice immunized with our SynCon WT1 antigen broke tolerance and generated robust neo-antigen-like T cells. The immunized mice also exhibited smaller tumors and prolonged survival in a tumor challenge study. SynCon WT1 DNA vaccination also broke tolerance and generated neo-antigen-like T cell immune responses in Rhesus monkeys, a species whose immune system closely resembles that of humans. The ability to overcome the immune system’s usual tolerance of WT1 antigen suggests the potential of our SynCon WT1 antigen to address multiple WT1-expressing cancer in humans. We previously reported similar results for our SynCon hTERT and PSMA cancer antigens. 
We have completed a Phase 1/2 immuno-oncology trial of INO-5401 and INO-9012 (IL-12 plasmid) in participants with newly diagnosed GBM, in combination with cemiplimab (Libtayo®), a PD-1 inhibitor developed jointly by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi. This open-label trial began in 2018 and enrolled 52 newly diagnosed GBM participants. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, and the trial also evaluated immunogenicity and efficacy (overall survival). Data from the trial has been presented at several medical conferences. In November 2019, we provided interim results showing that 80% (16 of 20) of MGMT gene promoter methylated participants and 75% (24 of 32) of unmethylated participants, the more difficult to treat group, were progression-free at six months (PFS6) measured from the time of their first dose, exceeding historical standard-of-care data. This immunotherapy combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor also exhibited supportive safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data and suggested a safety profile consistent with that of Libtayo as well as our other 
product candidates. Most participants assessed had a T cell immune response to one or more tumor-associated antigens encoded by INO-5401, and immune responses to all three tumor-associated antigens were also observed in this trial. 
In May 2020, we updated these results, showing that 85% (44 out of 52) of the participants in this trial were alive for at least 12 months following treatment. The updated results showed that 84.4% percent (27 of 32) of participants with MGMT promoter unmethylated tumors, and 85% (17 of 20) of participants with MGMT promoter methylated tumors, were alive at 12 months. Activated killer T cells directed towards one, two or all three cancer antigens in INO-5401 were detected in almost all participants tested.
In November 2020, additional data from the trial were presented at the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) Annual Meeting. Survival data at 18 months showed that 70% (14/20) of MGMT promoter methylated GBM participants were alive, and 50% (16/32) of MGMT promoter unmethylated participants were alive after 18 months. Median overall survival in the unmethylated GBM participants was 17.9 months, which compares favorably to historical controls. An update on immunology data showed that in the MGMT promoter unmethylated cohort, 19 of 22 (86%) participants had an IFN-gamma T cell response that increased over baseline to one or more of the antigens encoded by INO-5401. In the MGMT promoter methylated cohort, 16 of 17 (94%) participants had an IFN-gamma response that increased over baseline to one or more of the antigens encoded by INO-5401.
In November 2021, updated data was presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer pre-conference workshop from the GBM-001 Phase 2 trial. Overall survival at 24 months was 22% (7/32) for the MGMT unmethylated cohort and 55% (11/20) for the MGMT methylated cohort. The trial showed that INO-5401+INO-9012 with cemiplimab and radiation/TMZ have an acceptable safety profile, are immunogenic, and may improve survival in newly diagnosed GBM. 
INO-5151 (INO-5150 + INO-9012) for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer 
We are developing INO-5151, which consists of DNA plasmids targeting Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), combined with INO-9112, the IL-12 plasmid, for the treatment of prostate cancer. In the United States in 2022, there will be an estimated 268,490 new cases of prostate cancer and about 34,500 deaths due to this cancer. We previously completed a Phase 1 trial of INO-5150, DNA plasmids targeting PSA and PSMA. Data from this trial have been presented at several annual meetings, most recently at the 2018 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress and have suggested that men treated with INO-5150 on the trial experienced a slowing of PSA doubling time, an important indicator of potential clinical benefit. Data presented at these conferences also showed immunogenicity and tolerability of INO-5150.
In 2019, we announced a clinical collaboration with Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy (PICI) and the Cancer Research Institute (CRI) as part of which INO-5151 is being combined with an immune modulator (CDX-301, FLT3 ligand, a dendritic cell mobilizer) and a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab) in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), in a PICI-sponsored platform trial (PORTER). This combination trial is an open-label, non-randomized, exploratory platform trial designed to assess the safety and antitumor activity of multiple immunotherapy-based combinations in participants with mCRPC who have received prior secondary androgen inhibition. This trial will evaluate biomarkers of immune activity and clinical outcomes using a multi-omic, multi-parameter approach. Our immunotherapy is one arm of this PICI-supported trial, and recruitment is ongoing. Under the agreement, PICI will design and conduct the clinical trial, working in collaboration with its established network of clinical academic and industry cancer centers, with funding support from CRI. We will provide financial contributions based on the actual costs of the trial, if INO-5151 reaches the initiation of a Phase 3 trial. 
Infectious Disease Product Candidates
Our product development platform also allows for rapid design, pre-clinical testing, manufacturing and clinical development of our vaccine and immunotherapy product candidates. In 2016, we were the first entity able to advance a Zika virus vaccine into human clinical trials, 4.5 months after the World Health Organization, or WHO, declared the emerging Zika virus infections to be a Pandemic Health Emergency of International Concern. Previously, we led the development of the first MERS vaccine in human clinical trials. More recently, our DNA medicines platform and SynCon® capabilities allowed us to rapidly respond to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak in early 2020. We believe that our development platform is well positioned to support global health agencies to develop preparedness countermeasures against bioterrorism and/or emerging pandemic agents. 
INO-4800 for COVID-19 
Background
A novel strain of coronavirus emerged in the human population in Wuhan City, China in late 2019. The new virus is a member of the genus of Coronaviruses, which is comprised of seven known viruses that can infect and make humans ill, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 
(SARS-CoV), as well as four other lower risk coronaviruses which can cause the common cold. The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus was subsequently named COVID-19.
The virus quickly spread throughout China, Asia, and worldwide. As of February 2021, almost every country on earth had reported confirmed cases. As of January 2022, a total of nearly 320 million confirmed cases had been reported worldwide, with a total of more than 5,510,000 reported deaths directly due to this disease. Both the numbers of reported and estimated actual cases began to rise significantly in 2022 with the emergence of the Omicron variant of concern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Presently, several major variants of concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2 have evolved and spread significantly from several portions of the globe and quickly to many countries. These VOCs have the characteristics of at least having a significantly increased transmission rate compared to the original/main SARS-CoV-2 strain. Currently authorized vaccines may not be as effective at preventing disease due to these variants.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial 
In December 2020, we announced the publication of peer-reviewed Phase 1 clinical data from the first cohort of 40 participants receiving INO-4800. In this trial, INO-4800 was immunogenic in all vaccinated participants, generating an immune response of humoral (including neutralizing antibodies) and/or cellular responses (both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). 
Additionally, Phase 1 clinical data found INO-4800 to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no serious adverse events reported. Six Grade 1 adverse events (AEs) were observed, primarily minor injection site reactions. These only occurred on the day of the first or second dosing, and the AEs did not increase in frequency with the second administration.
Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial – INNOVATE 
In December 2020, we announced the dosing of the first participant in our Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating INO-4800, as part of our Phase 2/3 clinical trial, called INNOVATE (INOVIO INO-4800 Vaccine Trial for Efficacy). The Phase 2 segment of the trial has enrolled approximately 400 participants who are 18 years or older at 17 U.S. sites to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in order to confirm the dose(s) for the subsequent efficacy evaluation as part of the Phase 3 segment of the trial.
The Phase 2 segment of the trial, funded by the DoD, evaluated safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of INO-4800 in a two-dose regimen (1.0 mg or 2.0 mg), in a three-to-one randomization to receive either INO-4800 or placebo to confirm the more appropriate dosing level(s) for each of three age groups (18-50 years, 51-64 years and 65 years and older) at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure for the subsequent Phase 3 efficacy evaluation. Results from the Phase 2 segment provided us with the information to select the dose level for the Phase 3 segment.
The global Phase 3 segment of INNOVATE is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of INO-4800 in a two-dose regimen (2.0 mg per dose), administered one month apart, in a 2-to-1 randomization in men and non-pregnant women 18 years of age and older. The primary endpoint of this case-driven Phase 3 trial is virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19. The Phase 3 segment has received authorization to proceed in seven countries: Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Thailand, India, Philippines, and the United States.
We conducted an in vitro assessment of the cross-reactivity of INO-4800 vaccine-induced immune responses against the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Testing was observed to provide full maintenance of T cell responses against the Omicron variant in clinical samples from participants who has received INO-4800, including CD8+ responses, in line with results observed with the vaccines of other developers, significantly decreased levels of both neutralizing and binding antibodies against Omicron. The maintenance and preservation of T cell responses continue to remain a consistent observation for INO-4800 against the ancestral COVID-19 virus and across all variants of concern (VOCs) tested to date, including Omicron. We believe this is a critical observation as T cell responses are thought to play an important role in protection against severe disease and death and may be central to the durability of vaccine protection. 
In response to the dominance of the Omicron variant globally and the persistence of cross-reactive T cell responses generated by INO-4800, including CD8+, across all variants of concern to date, we plan to seek regulatory approval to amend the primary endpoint of INNOVATE from prevention of virologically confirmed COVID-19 disease to prevention of severe disease due to COVID-19. We believe INO-4800's ability to generate T cell responses could be critical in meeting the proposed amended primary endpoint.
In addition, to reflect the potential impact of the Omicron variant on INNOVATE, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended that we pause enrollment of new patients in the global Phase 3 clinical trial of INO-4800 in order to update the Informed Consent Form and Investigator Brochure. As a result of the DSMB’s recommendation, as well as our plans to seek approval to amend the trial’s primary endpoint, we have paused enrollment of new patients in INNOVATE. Interim efficacy data from INNOVATE will therefore not be available in the first half of 2022 as previously expected. 
We are also evaluating the feasibility of an additional ex-US heterologous boost (vaccination with a different vaccine from the previous administration) trial with our COVID-19 DNA vaccine candidate, INO-4800, as a booster in a non-inferiority 
clinical trial compared to approved viral vector and inactivated COVID-19 vaccines. Viral vector and inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have been the vaccine of choice, particularly in low-to-middle income countries where thermostability of a vaccine can be critical. Moreover, global demand for heterologous boosters may not be met with currently licensed vaccines (EUA or full authorization) or those not currently licensed but with Phase 3 efficacy data. While a clear regulatory pathway for a heterologous boost trial has not been defined, regulatory agencies in some countries have expressed consideration towards the use of heterologous boost vaccines in clinical trials, given the logistical challenges as well as vaccine hesitancy associated with some approved vaccines. We believe that second generation vaccines are needed to address issues such as vaccine equity and logistical challenges that are still left to be solved. At the same time, we recognize that there are regulatory hurdles to be cleared. Key features of our DNA vaccine technology which make it a potentially favorable booster candidate include generating T-cell responses against multiple variants of concern, lack of anti-vector immunity, tolerability of re-administration, thermostability for transport, storage, and distribution. 
Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial – SOLIDARITY TRIAL VACCINES (STV)
 INO-4800 is one of two initial COVID-19 vaccine candidates included in the WHO's Solidarity Trial Vaccines, which is designed to "rapidly evaluate the efficacy and safety of promising new candidate vaccines selected by an independent vaccine prioritization advisory group composed of leading scientists and experts." Recruitment for the trial has begun in Colombia, Mali and the Philippines; enrollment is expected at more than 40 sites across the three countries. According to the WHO, the trial "has the additional potential to uncover second-generation vaccines with greater efficacy, conferring greater protection against variants of concern offering longer duration of protection, and/or using needle-free routes of administration.” The trial is sponsored by the WHO. 
INO-4800 in China 
In December 2020, we announced the dosing of the first participant in our Phase 2 clinical trial of INO-4800 in China. The Phase 2 clinical trial being conducted in China is independent of the INNOVATE Phase 2/3 clinical trial of INO-4800 and will enroll approximately 640 participants who are 18 years or older. Our collaborator Advaccine is conducting and funding the Phase 2 trial in China. 
 The Phase 2 clinical trial of INO-4800 in China has enrolled both 18-59 years old adults and older adults (60 years and older) with the primary endpoints of evaluating safety and immunogenicity within the Chinese population. The dosing regimen involves two vaccinations at 0 and 28 days with either 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg dosing levels and is similar to the Phase 2 segment of the INNOVATE trial.
Our partner Advaccine has completed enrollment of its 200-participant homologous and 267-participant heterologous boost trials in China. The trials are designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of INO-4800 as a homologous boost where INO-4800 was administered as the primary vaccine and as heterologous boost where an inactivated vaccine was administered as the primary vaccine. 
COVID-19 dMAb®
In December 2020, we announced that we along with a team of scientists from The Wistar Institute, AstraZeneca, the University of Pennsylvania, and Indiana University received a $37.6 million grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a research and development agency of the DoD and the JPEO-CBRND, to use our dMAb technology to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific dMAbs that function as both a therapeutic and preventive treatment for COVID-19. See “Synthetic DNA-based Monoclonal Antibodies Program” below for more information about our dMAb technology. 
As part of DARPA's two-year grant, our and Wistar's teams have constructed COVID-19 dMAb candidates mirroring AstraZeneca's traditional recombinant monoclonal antibody candidates currently being tested in clinical trials to treat COVID-19. These dMAb candidates can be quickly developed and produced in vivo, offering a cost-effective and scalable therapeutic and preventive option for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The dMAb® candidates will then be advanced into preclinical studies and then potentially into human clinical trials. 
Global Manufacturing Consortium for INO-4800 
In March 2020, we received a $5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to accelerate the testing and scale up of CELLECTRA® 3PSP proprietary smart devices for the intradermal delivery of INO-4800. 
In April 2020, we announced an agreement to expand our manufacturing partnership with the German contract manufacturer Richter-Helm BioLogics GmbH & Co. KG, to support large-scale manufacturing of INO-4800. 
In September 2020, we announced that Thermo Fisher Scientific signed a letter of intent to manufacture INO-4800. Thermo Fisher plans to manufacture INO-4800 drug substance as well as perform fill and finish of INO-4800 drug product at its commercial facilities in the United States.
In December 2020, we announced the execution of an agreement with Kaneka Eurogentec S.A., an affiliate of Kaneka Corporation, for Eurogentec to manufacture INO-4800 at their GMP plasmid production site in Belgium.
COVID-19 Variants of Concern (VOC)
We have been closely monitoring the development and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, with a particular focus on the Alpha (aka B.1.1.7 or “UK”), Beta (aka B.1.351 or original “South African”), Gamma (aka B.1.1.28.1 or “Brazilian”), Delta (aka B.1.617.2 or “Indian”), and Omicron (aka B.1.1.529 or newer “South African”) variants of concern (VOCs) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We have been and are continuing to evaluate the impact of newly circulating strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the immune profile of INO-4800 through an assessment of binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies in both live and pseudo-type neutralization assays as well as assessing the impact of the INO-4800-generated T cell responses on these variants.
We are also developing next-generation, pan-COVID vaccine candidates, that could be tailored to the known and potentially the unknown SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using our SynCon® gene optimization algorithm to analyze the available sequence data from all existing circulating variants, we are seeking to create a synthetic SAR-CoV-2 spike protein gene design intended to protect against the known VOC as well the future unknown strains. Our DNA vaccines generate a balanced immune response, including T cell responses, which we believe could make our pan-COVID vaccine candidates less susceptible to changes in the genetic sequence of the virus. DNA vaccines can also be used for multiple boosts without being impacted by anti-vector immunity or an increase in reactogenicity. Moreover, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have shown that DNA vaccines could also be used to boost the initial immune responses generated by multiple other vaccine platforms. 
INO-4700 for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
Background on MERS
The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS is a viral respiratory illness first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS appears to have been transmitted from an animal reservoir to humans but human to human transmission has been confirmed. The virus for this disease belongs to the Coronaviradea family (or a coronavirus – MERS-CoV), and was not shown to be a communicable virus spreading in a sustained way in communities, but rather via rapid spread in the nosocomial setting, such as emergency rooms and/or hospitals without adherence to state-of-the-art infection control practices, which can result in outbreaks with many cases, including super-spreading events. Like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 linked to another coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), which made approximately 8,000 people ill and was fatal in nearly 10% of those cases, MERS-CoV appears to cause severe lung infections. However, the case-fatality rate (death rate) of MERS has typically been between 30% and 40%, which is significantly higher than that of SARS. While the SARS epidemic in 2003 killed 10% of those who became ill from the SARS virus, MERS has killed approximately 34% of people who people who became ill from the MERS virus from 2012 to October 2021. MERS differs in that it also causes rapid kidney failure. Its high death rate has caused serious concern among global health officials. 
Despite the continuing threat of MERS outbreaks, there are no approved vaccines or treatments for MERS.
Clinical Development – MERS
In April 2018, we announced a collaboration with CEPI under which we are developing vaccine candidates against MERS. CEPI will fund up to $56 million of costs to support our pre-clinical and clinical advancement through Phase 2 of our vaccine candidate INO-4700. The goal of the collaboration is for our MERS vaccine to be available as soon as possible for emergency use. 
In April 2020, we announced interim data through week 16 from a Phase 1/2a trial of DNA vaccine INO-4700. Vaccine recipients had strong antibody and T cell immune responses after 2 or 3 doses with 0.6 mg, delivered intradermally with our CELLECTRA® device. The vaccination regimen was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated SAEs. The researchers at the Wistar Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, and the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) collaborated on this trial.
For those receiving 0.6 mg of INO-4700, 88% seroconverted after a two-dose regimen at 0 and 8 weeks, while for those receiving a three-dose regimen given at 0, 4 and 12 weeks, 84% seroconverted after 2 doses and 100% after 3 doses, as measured by a binding antibody assay against the full-length S protein (ELISA). Additionally, 92% of the vaccine recipients in both groups displayed the ability to neutralize the virus using a pseudotype-based neutralization assay. Robust T cell responses were observed in 60% of vaccine recipients after the two-dose regimen and 84% of those in the three-dose group (ELISpot assay). A single dose of 0.6 mg of INO-4700 intradermal vaccination resulted in 74% binding antibody response rate and 48% neutralization antibody response rate. 
We have dosed and completed enrollment for the first part (dose finding stage) of the Phase 2 trial (192 participants) of INO-4700. The multi-center Phase 2 trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of INO-4700 administered with CELLECTRA 2000 in approximately 500 healthy adult participants. The trial, which is sponsored by INOVIO and fully funded by CEPI, is being conducted at sites in Jordan, Lebanon, and Kenya where MERS cases have been reported.
INO-4201 for Ebola Virus Disease
Background on Ebola
The Ebola virus causes one of the most virulent viral diseases, with case fatality rates averaging 50% but approaching up to 90% in past outbreaks in areas with no or under-developed health care. Ebola can spread through human-to-human transmission by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or bodily fluids of an infected individual and with surfaces or materials that contain the contaminated fluids of an infected person, such as bedding and clothing. It is capable of causing death within two to twenty-one days of exposure. In November 2019, the first conditional approval was issued for a preventive vaccine against Ebola virus. This approval was from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the vaccine ERVEBO®. That same month, the WHO pre-qualified that vaccine for use in high-risk countries. In the next month, the FDA approved that vaccine. However, there are no proven effective therapeutic treatments for Ebola. In addition, various experimental approaches have already been associated with undesirable side effects and limited ability to scale manufacturing.
In 2018, two Ebola outbreaks occurred, both in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The second Ebola outbreak of 2018 in the DRC became the second largest Ebola outbreak in world history. This particular outbreak had a 66% case-fatality ratio (aka case-fatality rate) as of February 2020. On June 1, 2020 an additional Ebola outbreak was declared in the DRC, before the outbreak was declared over on November 18, 2020. More recently, Ebola outbreaks have occurred in Guinea (February to June, 2021) and in the DRC (October 2021 and still ongoing). 
Clinical Development - Ebola 
In March 2019, Phase 1 clinical data of our Ebola vaccine candidate INO-4201 was published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases. We believe that this trial, which is being fully funded by DARPA, further supports the advancement of the intradermal delivery platform for emerging infectious diseases. Significantly, intradermal (skin) administration with our CELLECTRA® smart delivery device resulted in 100% of evaluable participants in the trial generating antigen-specific antibody responses that persisted for more than one year in most participants and generated T cell responses equivalent to or better than the group that received intramuscular delivery. We believe these published data further validate the tolerability, potency, and product stability advantages of our vaccine and immunotherapy platform. 
Our Ebola vaccine candidate was evaluated in five groups of healthy participants. Of 70 evaluated participants, 67 (96%) seroconverted and mounted a strong antibody response to the Ebola glycoprotein antigen following the three dose immunization regimen; 52 participants (74%) seroconverted after only two doses. 
In the trial arm using intradermal (skin) administration, 13 of 13 evaluable participants (100%) generated antigen-specific antibody responses after only two doses and all remained seropositive after three immunizations. 
In December 2021, we announced complete enrollment of a 46-participant Phase 1b trial in which INO-4201 will be assessed as a heterologous booster in healthy volunteers previously vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo®), an FDA- and EMA- approved viral vector-based Ebola vaccine. To date INO-4201 has been well-tolerated and has not demonstrated systemic SAEs, such as fever, joint pain, and low white blood cell counts, that have been reported in association with some viral vector-based Ebola vaccines currently in development.
INO-4500 for Lassa Fever
Background on Lassa Fever
Lassa fever, also known as Lassa hemorrhagic fever, is an acute viral disease which occurs mostly in West Africa. The disease can cause a range of outcomes including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, swelling of the face, pain in the muscles, chest, back and abdomen, bleeding of various parts of the body including the eyes and nose, vagina, and gastrointestinal tract, and death. Of the survivors of Lassa fever, about one-third have sudden-onset hearing loss, with more than half of those cases resulting in permanent hearing loss. This infection is spread through contact with infected rodents. Person to person transmission is also possible, via bodily fluids, albeit less common. Lassa virus infection in West Africa is estimated to affect 100,000 to 300,000 people annually, resulting in approximately 5,000 deaths, as disease and infection surveillance has been poor. Because of difficulties in diagnosing Lassa fever and the remoteness of many areas in which the disease occurs, the numbers of cases and deaths are likely significantly under-reported. Though the majority (about 80%) of Lassa virus-infected persons are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, the infection can be quite serious to fatal in others. There are no approved vaccines or treatments specifically for Lassa. The case-fatality ratio (aka case-fatality rate) (CFR) among patients hospitalized for Lassa fever is about 15% to 20%, and in some epidemics the CFR has reached 50% in hospitalized patients, such as in the 2015-2016 Nigeria portion of the West Africa outbreak. In lab confirmed cases in Nigeria from 2019 through 2020, the CFR was 21%. The CFR among pregnant women is particularly high, and in pregnant women infected with Lassa virus the fetal death rate due to spontaneous abortion rate is estimated to be about 95%. 
Clinical Trials
In May 2019, we dosed our first participant in our Phase 1, first-in-human clinical trial to evaluate INO-4500, a DNA candidate vaccine to prevent infection from the Lassa virus. In 2019, we fully enrolled 60 volunteers in this placebo controlled, blinded, dose escalation trial evaluating INO-4500 for safety, tolerability and immune responses. This trial represents the first Lassa candidate vaccine to enter the clinic. Our sponsored trial, as well as our INO-4500 program, is fully funded through the global partnership with CEPI that we entered into in April 2018. 
In October 2021, we announced that we have completed enrollment of a 220 participant Phase 1b trial in Accra, Ghana, which is the first vaccine clinical trial for Lassa Fever conducted in West Africa, where the viral illness is endemic. The dosing regimen involved two intradermal vaccinations at 0 and 28 days with either 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg doses. In addition to providing insights on the INO-4500 safety and immunogenicity profile, this trial will inform dose selection for subsequent Phase 2 trials in West Africa. If the result of this trial is positive, we expect to advance INO-4500 into a Phase 2 trial. If satisfactory Phase 2 data are achieved, CEPI, in cooperation with local regulatory authorities and the WHO, could elect to stockpile the vaccine for future use throughout the region.
Synthetic DNA-based Monoclonal Antibody Programs
Background on recombinant Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)
Recombinant mAbs have become one of the most valuable therapeutic technologies of recent years. In 2020, global sales of mAbs exceeded $100 billion.
mAbs are designed to bind to a very specific epitope (area) of an antigen or cell surface target and can bind to almost any selected target. They have the ability to alert the immune system to attack and kill specific cancer cells (as in the case of Yervoy®) or block certain biochemical pathways (such as those leading to rheumatoid arthritis, as in the case of Humira®). However, mAb technology has limitations. mAbs are manufactured outside the body and require costly large-scale laboratory development and production. Additional limitations include high cost to develop and manufacture, their limited duration of in vivo potency, and a pharmacokinetic profile that can result in toxicity. We have created DNA encoded monoclonal antibodies that we believe may overcome many of the limitations associated with conventional mAb technology.
Using our core platform technology, we insert the DNA sequence for a specific monoclonal antibody in a DNA plasmid. We deliver the plasmid directly into cells of the body using our CELLECTRA smart delivery system, enabling the electroporated cells to manufacture those mAbs in vivo, - unlike conventional mAb technology that requires manufacture outside of the body. We believe this approach provides potentially significant advantages in terms of design simplicity, rapidity of execution and lower production costs.
We expect to design dMAb® product candidates not only for new disease targets not currently addressable with conventional recombinant mAbs, but also targets of existing, commercially available mAb products. We have already designed and produced dMAb product candidates targeting cancer mechanisms including checkpoint inhibition, anti-cancer pathways and anti-Tregs, as well as prophylactic and therapeutic dMAb product candidates for infectious diseases including COVID-19, Ebola, influenza, antibiotic resistant bacteria, dengue and Chikungunya.
In February 2019, we announced that in collaboration with The Wistar Institute and the University of Pennsylvania, the first participant was dosed as part of the first-ever human trial of our dMAb technology. Funded fully by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, this trial's focus is on the safety and tolerability of DNA plasmid encoding for a human anti-Zika antibody. This open-label trial is a single center, dose escalation trial that enrolled 24 healthy volunteers who received from one to four doses of INO-A002, our DNA plasmid encoding for a human anti-Zika antibody. Doses ranging from 0.5 mg to 4 mg of plasmids were injected per participant, independent of their body weight.
As described above, in December 2020, we and a team of scientists from The Wistar Institute, AstraZeneca, the University of Pennsylvania, and Indiana University received a $37.6 million grant from DARPA to use our DNA-encoded monoclonal antibody (dMAb) technology to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific dMAbs which could offer versatile capabilities to function as both a therapeutic and preventive treatment for COVID-19.
License, Collaboration, Supply and Other Agreements
We have entered into various arrangements with corporate, academic, and government collaborators, licensors, licensees and others. The most material of these arrangements are summarized below.
Advaccine
On December 31, 2020, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Advaccine Biopharmaceuticals Suzhou Co., Ltd. (“Advaccine”), which was amended and restated on June 7, 2021 (as amended and restated, the “Advaccine Agreement”). Under the terms of the Advaccine Agreement, we granted to Advaccine the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize our vaccine candidate INO-4800 within the territories of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (referred to collectively as “Greater China”) and 33 additional countries in Asia. Advaccine does not have the right to grant sublicenses, other than to affiliated entities, without our express prior written consent. As part of the collaboration, 
Advaccine also granted to us a non-exclusive license to certain DNA vaccine manufacturing processes.
The June 2021 amendment relates to our collaboration with Advaccine to jointly conduct the global Phase 3 segment of our ongoing Phase 2/3 trial of INO-4800 and expand the existing collaboration to include the global Phase 3 trial. We will jointly participate in the trial and will equally share the global development costs for the trial, including our manufacturing costs to supply INO-4800. In certain instances, we will have the right to convert the exclusive license to a non-exclusive license in the licensed territories, other than Greater China, unless Advaccine agrees to pay us its full share of development costs in excess of a specified maximum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Advaccine will be fully responsible for conducting the trial in Greater China, including its costs and expenses incurred in conducting the trial in Greater China. We will be fully responsible for our costs and expenses, if any, incurred solely as a result of our activities in connection with the performance of the trial in the United States. The parties may continue to conduct clinical trials of INO-4800 outside of the territories covered by the Advaccine Agreement.
In the event that a global purchasing entity desires to enter into a purchase agreement for INO-4800 in both parties’ territories, the parties will enter into good faith negotiations for an arrangement to supply INO-4800 to such entity. In addition, we are permitted to enter into an agreement with a global purchasing entity to authorize the entity to conduct a portion of the global Phase 3 trial in the licensed territory outside of Greater China.
Under the Agreement, Advaccine made an upfront payment to us of $3.0 million in January 2021. In addition to the upfront payment, we are entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $206.0 million, payable upon the achievement of specified milestones related to the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of INO-4800, including the achievement of specified net sales thresholds for INO-4800 in Greater China and the additional covered territories, if approved. In December 2020 we earned a $2.0 million milestone payment based on the enrollment of the first participant in the Phase 2 clinical trial for the product in the Advaccine territory. We are also entitled to receive a royalty equal to a high single-digit percentage of annual net sales in each region within the licensed territory, subject to reduction in the event of competition from biosimilar products in a particular region and in other specified circumstances. Advaccine’s obligation to pay royalties will continue, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis and region-by-region basis, for ten years after the first commercial sale in a particular region within Greater China or, if later, until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering a given licensed product in a given region.
Beginning in the first calendar year following the first commercial sale of INO-4800 in the licensed territory outside of Greater China, Advaccine will pay us an annual maintenance fee of $1.5 million for a period of five years, which fee will be creditable against any royalties payable by Advaccine with respect to sales outside of Greater China.
Under the Advaccine Agreement, we will supply Advaccine’s clinical requirements of INO-4800 and devices, although Advaccine may manufacture INO-4800 for its clinical use and may procure alternate suppliers. Advaccine is responsible for the manufacture and supply of INO-4800 itself or through a contract manufacturer for commercial use. Upon Advaccine’s reasonable request, the parties may negotiate a separate clinical and/or commercial supply agreement.
The Advaccine Agreement will continue in force on a region-by-region basis until Advaccine has no remaining royalty obligations in such region. Either party may terminate the Advaccine Agreement (i) in the event the other party shall have materially breached its obligations thereunder and such default shall have continued for a specified period after written notice thereof or (ii) upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. In addition, we may terminate the agreement, upon prior written notice, if Advaccine (i) ceases all development or commercialization activities for at least nine months, subject to certain exceptions, or (ii) challenges the validity, enforceability or scope of any of the patents licensed by us to Advaccine under the Advaccine Agreement, subject to certain conditions. Advaccine may terminate the Advaccine Agreement at any time for convenience upon nine months’ written notice to us, if such notice is provided before the first commercial sale of INO-4800 in the licensed territory, or 18 months’ written notice thereafter; provided that we may accelerate the effectiveness of such termination to the extent permitted by law.
ApolloBio
In December 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated License and Collaboration Agreement with Beijing Apollo Saturn Biological Technology Limited, a corporation organized under the laws of China, or ApolloBio. Under the terms of this License and Collaboration Agreement, which became effective in March 2018, we granted to ApolloBio the exclusive right to develop and commercialize VGX-3100, our DNA immunotherapy product candidate designed to treat pre-cancers caused by HPV, within the agreed upon territories. As part of the collaboration, ApolloBio will fund all clinical development costs within the licensed territory.
In addition to the upfront payment that we received in 2018, we are entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $20.0 million, less required income, withholding or other taxes, upon the achievement of specified milestones related to the regulatory approval of VGX-3100 in accordance with the Amended and Restated License and Collaboration Agreement. In the event that VGX-3100 is approved for marketing in these territories, we will be entitled to receive royalty payments based on a tiered percentage of annual net sales, with such percentage being in the low- to mid-teens, subject to reduction in the event of generic 
competition in a particular territory. ApolloBio’s obligation to pay royalties will continue for 10 years after the first commercial sale in a particular territory or, if later, until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering the licensed products in the specified territory. The License and Collaboration Agreement, once effective, will continue in force until ApolloBio has no remaining royalty obligations.
Competition
As we develop and seek to ultimately commercialize our product candidates, we face and will continue to encounter competition with an array of existing or development-stage drug and immunotherapy approaches targeting diseases we are pursuing. We are aware of various established enterprises, including major pharmaceutical companies, broadly engaged in vaccine/immunotherapy research and development. These include Janssen Pharmaceuticals (part of J&J), Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca. There are also various development-stage biotechnology companies involved in different vaccine and immunotherapy technologies including but not limited to Advaxis, Bavarian Nordic, CureVac, Dynavax, Hookipa, Iovance, Nektar, Translate Bio, Zydus, and Vir Biotechnology. If these companies are successful in developing their technologies, it could materially and adversely affect our business and our future growth prospects. 
Merck and GlaxoSmithKline have commercialized preventive vaccines against HPV to protect against cervical cancer. Some companies are seeking to treat early HPV infections or low- grade cervical dysplasia. Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure, commonly known as LEEP, is a surgical procedure and is the current standard of care for treating high-grade cervical dysplasia. Advaxis and Gilead Sciences have therapeutic cervical cancer product candidates under development. Many companies are pursuing different approaches to GBM, prostate, breast, lung and other cancers we are targeting. 
A large number of companies are actively advancing COVID-19 vaccines through the clinic. Pfizer and BioNtech, Moderna Therapeutics, Janssen (J&J), Novavax, Zydus, and AstraZeneca have received conditional or complete approval for their COVID-19 vaccines from either the U.S., WHO, or European regulatory authorities. Additionally, several companies such as CanSino Biologics and Bharat Biotech are currently developing vaccine candidates in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials. 
We also compete more specifically with companies seeking to utilize antigen-encoding DNA delivered with electroporation or other DNA delivery technologies such as viral vectors or lipid vectors to induce in vivo generated antigen production and immune responses to prevent or treat various diseases. These competitive technologies have shown promise, but they each also have their unique obstacles to overcome. 
Viral Vaccine Delivery 
This technology utilizes a virus as a carrier or vector to deliver genetic material into target cells. The method is efficient for delivering immunotherapy antigens and has the advantage of mimicking real viral infection so that the recipient will mount a broad immune response against the immunotherapy. The greatest limitation of the technology stems from problems with unwanted immune responses against the viral vector, limiting its use to patients who have not been previously exposed to the viral vector and making repeated administration difficult. In addition, complexity and safety concerns increase their cost and complicate regulatory approval. 
Lipid DNA/RNA Delivery
A number of lipid formulations have been developed that increase the effect of DNA/RNA immunotherapies. These work by either increasing uptake of the DNA/RNA into cells or by acting as an adjuvant, alerting the immune system. While there has been significant progress in this field, including emergency use authorization of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in 2020, lipid nanoparticle delivery of mRNA has thermal stability issues as well as the potential of adverse events from the lipid nanoparticle formulations.
DNA Immunotherapy Delivery with Electroporation 
There are other companies with electroporation intellectual property and devices. We believe we have significant competitive advantages over other companies focused on electroporation for multiple reasons: 
•We have an extensive history and experience in developing the methods and devices that optimize the use of electroporation in conjunction with DNA-based agents. This experience has been validated with multiple sets of interim data from multiple clinical studies assessing DNA-based immunotherapies and vaccines against cancers and infectious disease.
•We have a broad product line of electroporation instruments designed to enable DNA delivery in tumors, muscle, and skin. 
•We have been proactive in filing for patents, as well as acquiring and licensing additional patents, to expand our global patent estate. 
If any of our competitors develop products with efficacy or safety profiles significantly better than our product candidates, we may not be able to commercialize our products, and sales of any of our commercialized products could be harmed. Some of 
our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do. Competitors may develop products earlier, obtain FDA approvals for products more rapidly, or develop products that are more effective than those under development by us. We will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive; however, research and development by others may render our technologies or products obsolete or noncompetitive or result in treatments or cures superior to ours. 
Our competitive position will be affected by the disease indications addressed by our product candidates and those of our competitors, the timing of market introduction for these products and the stage of development of other technologies to address these disease indications. For us and our competitors, proprietary technologies, the ability to complete clinical trials on a timely basis and with the desired results, and the ability to obtain timely regulatory approvals to market these product candidates are likely to be significant competitive factors. Other important competitive factors will include efficacy, safety, ease of use, reliability, availability and price of products and the ability to fund operations during the period between technological conception and commercial sales. 
The FDA and other regulatory agencies may expand current requirements for public disclosure of DNA-based product development data, which may harm our competitive position with foreign and United States companies developing DNA-based products for similar indications. 
Commercialization and Manufacturing
Because of the broad potential applications of our technologies, we intend to develop and commercialize products both on our own and through our collaborators and licensees. We intend to develop and commercialize products in well-defined specialty markets, such as infectious diseases and cancer. Where appropriate, we intend to rely on strategic marketing and distribution alliances.
We believe our plasmids can be produced in commercial quantities through uniform methods of fermentation and processing that are applicable to all plasmids. We believe we will be able to obtain sufficient supplies of plasmids for all foreseeable clinical investigations.
Intellectual Property 
Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. We file patent applications to protect our technologies, inventions and improvements to our inventions that we consider important to the development of our business. We file for patent registration extensively in the United States and in key foreign markets. Although our patent filings include claims covering various features of our products and product candidates, including composition, methods of manufacture and use, our patents do not provide us with complete protection, or guarantee, against the development of competing products. In addition, some of our know-how and technology are not patentable. We thus also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We also require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements, but such agreements may provide limited protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information.
Our intellectual property portfolio covers our proprietary technologies, including CELLECTRA® delivery systems as well as immunotherapy and vaccine construct related technologies. As of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio included 99 issued United States patents and over 651 issued foreign counterpart patents. We also have a number of patent applications pending in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.
If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology and our business would thus be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation through the courts. In addition, our patents, or any other patents that may be issued to us in the future, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in each country where we operate. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and domestic and international mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in those countries may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology. We may be required to expend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation, whether or not it is ultimately resolved in our favor, would result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel.
There may be rights we are not aware of, including applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued, could be asserted against us. These third parties could bring claims against us, and that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were 
brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or biologic drug candidate that is the subject of the suit. As a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. All of the issues described above could also impact our collaborators, which would also impact the success of the collaboration and therefore us.
Important legal issues remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biologic products, including vaccines, and processes in the United States and other important markets outside the United States, such as Europe and Japan. Foreign markets may not provide the same level of patent protection as provided under the United States patent system. We recognize that litigation or administrative proceedings may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of certain of our and others’ proprietary rights. Any such litigation or proceeding may result in a significant commitment of resources in the future and could force us to interrupt our operations, redesign our products or processes, or negotiate a license agreement, all of which would adversely affect our revenue. Furthermore, changes in, or different interpretations of, patent laws in the United States and other countries may result in patent laws that allow others to use our discoveries or develop and commercialize our products.
We cannot guarantee that the patents we obtain or the unpatented technology we hold will afford us significant commercial protection.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological products, or biologics, and medical devices, such as our product candidates. Generally, before a new biologic or medical device can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
Review and Approval of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products may be comprised of components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:
•A product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;
•Two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products;
•A drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device or biological where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
•Any investigational drug, device, or biological packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect. 
Our product candidates are combination products comprising an electroporation device for delivery of a biologic. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product, which means the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a device-biologic combination product is attributable to the biologic product, that is, if it acts by means of a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the biologic product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. We believe that all of our product candidates will have a biologic primary mode of action, with the device component reviewed under a Device Master File.
U.S. Biological Product Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the Biologics License Application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•Completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as pre-clinical laboratory tests, pre-clinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
•Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its proposed indication;
•Submission to the FDA of a BLA;
•Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, purity and potency;
•Potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States. 
The data required to support a BLA is generated in two distinct development stages: pre-clinical and clinical. The pre-clinical development stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the pre-clinical studies must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy participants under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research participants provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, participant selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial participant or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the 
product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion.
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and preliminary evaluation of efficacy is assessed. Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites, in multiple countries (from several hundred to several thousand participants) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may grant conditional approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials, such as these post-approval trials, to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important rate increase of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated intervals based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA and FDA Review Process
Following trial completion, trial data is analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the product candidate, and other relevant information. The BLA is a request for approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. The application includes positive findings from pre-clinical and clinical trials as well as ambiguous or negative results. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, which is adjusted on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, sixty days after the BLA’s submission, the FDA’s goal is to review BLAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review or six months of the filing date for priority review, if the application is for a product intended for a serious or life-threatening condition and the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. If not accepted for filing, the sponsor must resubmit the BLA and begin the FDA’s 
review process again, including the initial sixty-day review to determine if the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.
After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, purity and potency. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug product candidates or drug product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of a BLA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving a BLA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a product for marketing in the United States and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific populations, severities of allergies, and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the BLA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, a manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, also known as off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs and biologics for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use.
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. Moreover, the constituent parts of a combination product retain their regulatory status, for example, as a biologic or device, and as such, we may be subject to additional requirements in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, applicable to medical devices, such as design controls, purchasing controls, and corrective and preventive action. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. BLA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
The FDA also may require post-approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, REMS and post-marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Patients in the United States and elsewhere generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with their prescription drugs and vaccines. Accordingly, a pharmaceutical company’s ability to commercialize its products successfully depends in part on the extent to which private health insurers, other third-party payors, and governmental authorities, including Medicare and Medicaid, establish appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for its product candidates and related treatments. As a threshold for coverage and reimbursement, third-party payors generally require that products be approved for marketing by the FDA.
Coverage decisions may not favor new products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are available. The process for obtaining coverage for a product or service is separate from the process to obtain the associated reimbursement. Reimbursement levels can affect the adoption of products and services by physicians and patients. Additionally, products used in connection with medical procedures may not be reimbursed separately, but their cost may instead be bundled as part of the payment received by the provider for the procedure only. Separate reimbursement for a product or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available.
Coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products and vaccines can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement as the process of determining coverage and reimbursement is often time consuming and costly which may require the provision of scientific and clinical support for the use of the product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
A significant trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular products and services. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. Moreover, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governmental entities have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.
Healthcare Reform
In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that impact the ability to sell pharmaceutical products profitably. In the United States, the federal government enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA. Among the ACA’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are that it:
•Created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
•Increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
•Created new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
•Expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
•Expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program;
•Created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 
•Established a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011; and
•Created a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry qualifying health insurance coverage for all or part of a year. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax, and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the Affordable Care Act will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will remain in effect through 2031 with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Further there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 
2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform initiatives. Further, at the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Healthcare Laws
Certain federal, state, local and foreign healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, transparency, patients' rights, and privacy are applicable to the business of a pharmaceutical company. The laws that may affect a pharmaceutical company’s ability to operate include:
•The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, people from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the purchasing, ordering, or leasing of an item, good, facility or service, for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid;
•Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain individuals and entities; 
•the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and other healthcare professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
•The FDCA, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples; 
•The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which, among other things, prohibits companies issuing stock in the U.S. from bribing foreign officials for government contracts and other business; and
•State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives, and state laws governing the privacy 
and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and
•Additional state and local laws such as laws in California and Massachusetts, which mandate implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, and spending limits, and other state and local laws, such as laws in Vermont, Maine, and Minnesota which require reporting to state governments of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians. 
A pharmaceutical company will need to spend substantial time and money to ensure that its business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, which require strict compliance in order to offer protection, it is possible that governmental authorities may conclude that its business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare laws. If a pharmaceutical company’s operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, it may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, integrity and/or other oversight obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
Other Regulations
We also are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted.

Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of February 2022, we employed 317 people on a full-time basis. Of the total, 256 were in product research, which includes research and development, quality assurance, clinical, engineering and manufacturing, and 61 were in general and administrative functions, which includes corporate development, information technology, legal, commercial, investor relations, finance and corporate administration. About 50% of our workforce is comprised of women and approximately 50% is comprised of individuals with ethnically diverse backgrounds. In addition, three of the eight members of our board of directors are women. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
We compete in the highly competitive biotechnology industry. Attracting, developing and retaining talented people in research, quality assurance, clinical, engineering, manufacturing and other positions is crucial to executing our strategy and our ability to compete effectively. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent depends on several factors, including compensation and benefits, talent development and career opportunities, and work environment. To that end, we invest in our employees to be an employer of choice.
Employee Engagement
As we work to make an impact on how healthcare is delivered, we believe it is critical that our employees are informed and engaged. We communicate frequently and transparently with our employees through a variety of communication methods, including video and written communications, town hall meetings, employee surveys and our company intranet, and acknowledge individual contributions to INOVIO through several rewards and recognition initiatives. We believe these engagement efforts keep employees informed about our strategy, culture and purpose and motivated to do their best work. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also further strengthened our digital communication platform. Our employee communications during the pandemic have kept our employees informed on critical priorities and important actions being taken by management in response to the pandemic.
Health, Safety and Wellness
The physical health, financial well-being, life balance and mental health of our employees is vital to our success. In 2021, we launched a company wide comprehensive wellness program inclusive of financial, physical, and mental well-being.
The environmental, health and safety team stays abreast of local, regional and global concerns and trends and ensures safety procedures are in place to mitigate workplace injuries and safety risks. Employees are required to complete training in various safety procedures for the laboratories and manufacturing facilities and specialized safety training based on particular job duties. Designated Safety Officers and response teams oversee safety-related initiatives and a safety committee provides input on safety procedures, practices, and policies. Employees are required to wear personal protective equipment relevant for their particular job duties. Occupational injuries at the workplace are extremely low and are always investigated to determine if any environmental or other changes need to be implemented.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, strict safety protocols have been put in place for employees working on-site, including following federal and local guidelines and mandates to ensure the safety of the workforce. In addition to providing the necessary personal protective equipment, special engineering controls have been installed at the facilities to further protect workers. Regular communication and training about the virus and how individuals can protect themselves and others is ongoing with employees.
