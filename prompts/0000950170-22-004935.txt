Item 1. Business.
 Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of powerful and proprietary immunotherapeutic polyclonal human antibodies to treat and prevent infectious diseases and immune an autoimmune disorders, including infectious diseases resulting from outbreaks and pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic and respiratory diseases that have a more significant impact on the immune compromised population. Using private resources and more than $200 million of funds awarded from the U.S. Government emerging disease and medical countermeasures programs since September 2019, we have developed a novel drug development platform, that we refer to as our DiversitAb platform. This platform is based on the power of the human immune system and has the unique capability to generate large quantities of specifically targeted, high-potency, fully-human natural polyclonal antibodies without the need for convalescent plasma or human donors. Over a span of two decades, our founding scientists have refined, optimized, and advanced genetic engineering and antibody science to develop transchromosomic cattle (which we refer to as Tc Bovine) that produce fully-human antibodies. These Tc Bovine form a key component of our versatile DiversitAb platform.
 We are leveraging our DiversitAb platform to discover and develop product candidates with the potential to be first-in-class against novel targets or best-in-class against known, complex targets that treat diseases with significant unmet medical needs, including infectious and respiratory diseases, immune and autoimmune disorders, and oncology.
 Recent Milestones
Since September 2019, we achieved multiple milestones, including:
•Established proof-of-concept for our DiversitAb platform. 
 •Fully enrolled Phase 2a challenge study for SAB-176 in adults infected with influenza virus. 
 •Advanced to Phase 3 of NIH-Sponsored ACTIV-2 Trial based upon DSMB at interim analysis for SAB-185 (COVID-19) and reached 50% enrollment. 
 •Announced topline data demonstrating SAB-176 met its primary endpoint in our Phase 2a challenge study in adults infected with influenza virus. 
 •Announced that recent data demonstrated that SAB-185 retains neutralization activity against the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in an in vitro pseudovirus model.
 •Reported positive topline Phase 2 virology data demonstrating SAB-185 met Criteria for advancement to Phase 3.
 Proprietary DiversitAb Platform
Our proprietary DiversitAb platform gives us the unique ability to generate targeted, fully-human, polyclonal antibodies without the need for human donors or serum. These diverse and high potency antibodies can be targeted to viruses, bacteria, toxins, and human immunogen targets. The current platform relies on advanced genetic engineering that functionally replaces bovine antibodies with human antibodies (resulting in our Tc Bovine) produced from the full germ-line repertoire of human antibody heavy chain and kappa light chain genes on an engineered human artificial chromosome. The human antibody genes have been further engineered to efficiently produce a diverse repertoire of human immunoglobulin G (which is referred to as IgG) in bovine B-cells in response to specifically targeted immunogens as a result of the hyperimmunization of the Tc Bovine. Bovine were selected because they are large animals that produce large amounts of plasma with high concentrations of antibodies and respond effectively to immunogen challenge by producing high potency, high avidity polyclonal antibodies.
 The novel capability of the DiversitAb platform in harnessing the natural human biological immune response makes our platform well-suited to address multiple therapeutic categories, presenting potential opportunities for new therapies to address unmet medical needs.


The following graphic depicts the main elements of product development and manufacturing using our DiversitAb platform:
   Through our DiversitAb platform, we have engineered a systematic therapeutic engine that emulates the way that nature synergistically targets the complexity of human disease. The discovery, development and production process represent a “plug-and-play” approach:
•Develop Immunogen for Disease Target. An immunogen is developed for a specific target. The platform is designed to address virtually any target including bacteria (whole killed), viruses, toxins, plasmid DNA, cells, and human tissues. 
 •Hyperimmunize Tc Bovine. Tc Bovine are genetically engineered to produce fully-human antibodies, and then hyperimmunized with the immunogen, driving the immune response beyond protective levels. 
 •Collect Plasma. The target specific human antibodies are collected from the Tc Bovine as plasma donations. 
 •Isolate Human Antibodies. Human antibodies are then isolated from the plasma through a plasma fractionation process and tested per established protocols. These antibodies are then ready for use as a human immunotherapy treatment or prophylactic.
 Our DiversitAb platform is replicable and scalable. We believe that targeted human antibodies can be produced to counteract the same immunogen or multiple immunogens in as many Tc Bovine as necessary to generate sufficient doses of any target product. We can scale manufacturing by adding more Tc Bovine that are hyperimmunized to produce more plasma. Downstream processing primarily involves plasma fractionation to purify human IgG from all other plasma proteins to meet product specifications. Consistency of product is achieved by testing the potency of antibodies contained in each plasma collection and then combining plasma collections in a manufacturing pool that generates specified potencies within a specified antibody protein concentration.
 We believe that the speed with which we can deploy our DiversitAb platform to develop countermeasures for emerging diseases and pandemics represents a significant advantage relative to other antibody manufacturers. We have successfully utilized our DiversitAb platform technology to generate early proof-of-concept and initial clinical lots that address specified immunotherapy targets in as little as 90 days, including completion of IND-enabling studies, in response to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.
 We have vertically integrated the platform technology across a significant series of value inflection points. Our capabilities include advanced animal reproduction methods (cloning) to produce Tc Bovine, animal husbandry, immunogen development, plasma collection, plasma purification, drug substance manufacturing and product fill/finish, nonclinical and clinical study management, quality assurance, quality control, regulatory compliance, and program collaboration. We have built a broad-based network of third-party collaborators, service providers, vendors, consultants, and government partners that can help support each of these vertically integrated activities.
 

Three-Pronged Business Strategy
 Our strategy for product development relies on three distinct approaches which utilize our DiversitAb platform to develop product candidates:
 •Government Funded Programs
 •Partner Collaborations
 •Proprietary Pipeline Programs
 Government Funded Programs
 We are leveraging our relationships with various government agencies to advance programs using our DiversitAb platform. Our government funded programs have resulted in the advancement of our Rapid Response Antibody Program as well as the rapid advancement of our SAB-185 program from preclinical through our participation in the Phase 3 arm of the ACTIV-2 master protocol.
Rapid Response Antibody Program
 Since our founding in 2014, we have employed our DiversitAb platform to complete pre-clinical development of a dozen new products under a rapid timeline. Through commercial and government collaborations, we have produced new products from target identification through completion of IND-enabling studies in as little as 90 days. This timeline includes product concept, identifying and producing an immunogen, hyperimmunization of Tc Bovine, collection of plasma, purification of antibodies and initial potency assays to qualify the product candidate. We continue to innovate and vertically integrate workstreams to discover and develop products. Through a replicable combination of complex proprietary engineering and industry standard purification processes, we have demonstrated the ability to produce effective, high potency human polyclonal antibodies for a variety of targets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for an effective therapeutic, we were able to advance SAB-185 from immunogen to the clinic in 128 days.
 Our current agreement with Joint Program Executive Office-Enabling Biotechnologies (JPEO-EB) within the Department of Defense (DOD) was specifically directed to rapidly develop a medical countermeasure to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the result of which became SAB-185. The initial agreement was designed as a staged escalation of our Rapid Response Antibody Program to known and unknown targets. This initial scope, including additional funding support through the Defense Health Authority (DHA) and Biomedical Advancement Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and inclusion in the Countermeasures Acceleration Group (formerly Operation Warp Speed), was expanded to include SARS-CoV-2. As a result of our COVID-19 pandemic response, we successfully demonstrated our Rapid Response Antibody Program.
  The work we have completed to date has also resulted in significant increases in production capacity and accelerated advancement of our capability to provide a readiness system at scale. We continue work on the Rapid Response Antibody Program and completing the framework for a vertically integrated product development system that manages products from discovery through licensure and commercial manufacturing on an accelerated timeline.
 

SAB-185 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) Program (COVID-19)
 SAB-185 is a fully-human, specifically targeted, highly potent, and broadly neutralizing human polyclonal antibody therapeutic candidate for COVID-19. SAB-185, generated from the full-length spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain, has shown neutralization of the Munich, Washington, South African, Delta, Lambda, and other variant strains in preclinical and nonclinical studies. In addition, recent data has demonstrated that SAB-185 retains neutralization activity against the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in an in vitro pseudovirus model. Preclinical data has shown SAB-185 to be significantly more potent than human-derived COVID-19 convalescent IgG. We have completed multiple clinical and nonclinical studies to date, including a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers, and a Phase1b and Phase 2 clinical trial, both in COVID-19 patients. SAB-185 was being assessed in Phase 3 clinical trial as part of the ACTIV-2 master protocol, sponsored, funded and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (the NIH) in collaboration with the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG). On February 28, 2022, the NIH decided to discontinue the ACTIV-2 program after determining that the decrease in hospitalizations resulted in operational futility and made it impossible to demonstrate statistically significant clinical efficacy with the existing study design.
 We have advanced SAB-185 in collaboration with the U.S. Government, as part of the Countermeasures Acceleration Group, formerly Operation Warp Speed. We filed the IND application, produced the initial clinical doses and entered the Phase 1 clinical trial in just 128 days from the program initiation. SAB-185 was designed and developed without the need for human convalescent plasma or human B-cell donations.
 We continue to work with multiple U.S government collaborators to evaluate a number of options for the continued evaluation and testing of SAB-185, including advanced clinical development, targeting specialized populations, such as immune compromised, and alternate routes of administration.
 In addition, we intend to use the data from the Phase 3 portion of the ACTIV-2 program to help focus the continuing SAB-185 program. We expect the full data readout for the Phase 2 NIH ACTIV-2 trial to be available Mid-2022.
 Partner Collaborations
 We are pursuing a number of potential partner collaborations and license agreements for the development of product candidates with the potential to create first-in-class or best-in-class treatments. We expect that our partner collaborations will service two distinct channels: our discovery program to identify targets which can be commercialized solely by our partners and through joint development collaborations which leverage our technology and a potential partner’s resources to rapidly co-develop therapies based on novel targets developed using our DiversitAb platform.
Advantages of Polyclonal Antibodies
 While we can produce monoclonal antibodies when desirable, we believe that our human polyclonal antibodies have several advantages over certain monoclonal antibodies.
 •Polyclonal antibodies can be rapidly and consistently produced to target many different diseases and the regulatory pathway for plasma-derived polyclonals allows for broad potency to multiple disease targets within a single drug product. 
 •Because polyclonal antibodies are the natural way our bodies fight disease, they work organically with the rest of the immune system to activate effector cell function, which are the cells that defend the body in an immune response. 
 •Polyclonal antibodies can be used as both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and treatments and can be effective against highly-mutating viruses and other diseases with epitope mutations or variants as a result of the large number of different antibodies and their ability to bind to or block multiple epitopes.
 
A study was conducted in 2014 to demonstrate how Tc Bovine derived human polyclonal antibodies interacted with cellular immunity as compared with monoclonal antibodies. The data shown below demonstrated the ability of an anti-Ebola Tc Bovine-produced human polyclonal antibody product candidate to activate viable human effector cells as compared to monoclonal antibodies and negative controls. In this study, micro-beads coated with Ebola glycoprotein were cultured with human monocytes, neutrophils, and Natural Killer cells in the presence of test agents.


In the graphic above, the lines with solid black and white circles represent monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis in Figure A and B and Natural Killer cell degranulation in Figure C from the serum of two Tc Bovines hyperimmunized with Ebola glycoprotein on eight occasions. The blue and purple bars represent two Tc Bovine human polyclonal antibody lots produced from their plasma after the third and fourth immunizations and from the sixth, seventh and eighth immunizations respectively. The red and white bars represent a naïve Tc Bovine human polyclonal antibody and normal saline respectively. The green and orange bars represent two anti-Ebola glycoprotein monoclonals. As can be seen, both lots of anti-Ebola Tc Bovine human polyclonal antibodies demonstrated the ability to induce monocyte and neutrophil cell phagocytosis and Natural Killer cell degranulation. The lot produced from plasma after the sixth to the eighth immunization had better activity and is consistent with avidity maturation of the polyclonal antibodies. In contrast, while the monoclonals induced monocyte phagocytosis, only one was able to induce neutrophil phagocytosis. And critically, neither monoclonal antibody had the ability to induce Natural Killer cell degranulation. This indicates that Tc Bovine-produced human polyclonal antibodies induce human effector cells which are critically important to the control of viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens.
Advantages of our Polyclonal Antibody Approach
Our novel multivalent polyclonal approach, including hyperimmunization of the Tc Bovine results in specifically targeted, highly potent, high avidity, broadly diverse, fully human polyclonal antibodies, overcoming the challenges and exceeding the capabilities of traditional animal and human-derived polyclonal antibodies.
 •Animal-derived polyclonal antibodies, such as from horses or rabbits, have the disadvantage of being immunogenic in humans and they often cause severe hypersensitivity reactions limiting their clinical use or reuse as animal antibodies. 
 •Human-derived polyclonal antibodies are limited by the difficulty of collecting from humans and the inability of humans to produce antibodies to endogenous proteins under normal circumstances. Therefore, there is a significant potential advantage of Tc Bovine-produced human polyclonals in their ability to bind to both foreign exogenous or human endogenous protein targets, activate human effector cells, and not cause hypersensitivity reactions. 
Initial Preclinical Studies and Variant Resistance

This table provides an overview of our in vivo animal data from 2008 to 2018 that has enabled several pre-clinical studies with efficacy data demonstrating the broad potential of the DiversitAb platform to address diverse human diseases, globally. As shown in the table, infectious disease has been a strategic proving ground for the validation of our platform. Listed above are several significant human diseases for which adequate countermeasures may not exist. These include Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Zika, among others. We have completed preclinical development for multiple potential infectious disease products to address these global emerging human biothreats, and we have repeatedly demonstrated 100% preclinical efficacy in several animal models for most targets. This consistent in vivo efficacy demonstrates the broad potential of the platform and has ultimately led to the clinical advancement of multiple Phase 1 clinical trials including MERS-CoV, and our advanced infectious disease pipeline products, SAB-176 and SAB-185.


We have also demonstrated preclinical efficacy as both a prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. In a study conducted in 2017, we produced a fully-human polyclonal antibody, SAB-131, against Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEE). VEE is both a potential pandemic and biothreat pathogen for which we believe counter measures to be seriously lacking. Three cohorts of mice were challenged with a lethal dose of VEE. In contrast to the control group (black lines) all mice treated prophylactically or therapeutically with SAB-131 survived with no to minimal weight loss, indicative of minimal clinical symptoms. Additionally, images of the brain of each cohort demonstrate that SAB-131 can prevent or reduce viral encephalitis, which is a natural progression of the disease for this pathogen. This is visible by the reduction of signal intensity or viral load in the brain between the control group and the prophylactic and therapeutic treated groups. This suggests that these antibodies can protect against neurological pathogens and potentially address unmet neurological diseases in humans.


   Another potential therapeutic advantage of our polyclonal antibodies is their ability to effectively neutralize highly mutating pathogens such as Hantaan viruses. A study conducted in 2019 demonstrated SAB-159, an anti-Hantaan polyclonal antibody, completely neutralized the original wild-type virus, as well as both single mutants, and a double mutant of Hantaan virus. Effective neutralizing potency is indicated by the low in vitro IC50 threshold concentration below 100ng/mL indicated by the small grey area at the bottom of the graph. In contrast, two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies alone or in combination could not completely neutralize the three different mutant strains.


Initial Preclinical Toxicology (SAB-301 Anti-Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus)
 We tested proprietary Tc Bovine-derived human polyclonal antibodies (SAB-301 Anti-MERS-CoV) to confirm that they were safe and tolerable in a preclinical toxicology study conducted in 2016.
 The objectives of this study were to (i) determine potential toxic effects and target organs of toxicity, (ii) identify a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAB-301 in New Zealand White male and female rabbits after a single intravenous dose administration and (iii) determine the toxicokinetic parameters and immunogenicity after single dose administrations. We may use information from this study to design subsequent toxicity studies and to determine the suitability of the proposed human dose.
 In this study, male and female New Zealand White rabbits were given a single intravenous infusion of SAB-301 over 30 minutes at 50 mg/kg (600 mg/m2, Group 2) or at 370 mg/kg (4440 mg/m2, Group 3) on Day 1. The concentration of the dose formulation was constant (37.29 mg/ml) while dose volume varied for the treated groups. A control group was given vehicle (10 mM glutamic acid monosodium salt, 262 mM D-sorbitol, 0.05 mg/ml Tween 80, pH 5.5) at a volume (9.9 ml/kg) equivalent to that of the high dose group. The following parameters were evaluated: mortality/morbidity, clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, ophthalmology, clinical pathology (hematology, serum chemistry and coagulation), urinalysis, gross necropsy, histopathology, toxicokinetic analysis and immunogenicity.
 All animals survived and no drug-related effects were observed for clinical observations, ophthalmology, food consumption, body weight, hematology and coagulation parameters, gross necropsy findings or histopathology.
 Increases of 2- and 3.9-fold in globulin (GLO) were observed in males treated with SAB-301 at 50 and 370 mg/kg, respectively, compared with the controls on Day 3. GLO levels were also increased, 1.4- and 4.4-fold, respectively in the females in the 50 and 370 mg/kg groups, compared with the controls. Correlatively, the albumin to GLO ratio (ALB/GLO) was decreased, while total protein (TPR) was increased in these animals. By Day 50, the GLO, ALB/GLO ratio and TPR returned to normal. These changes are simply an increase in total globulin due to the intravenous injection of SAB-301, a human polyclonal antibody, into the blood stream. The analytical assays used to measure total globulin and protein in clinical chemistry cannot distinguish between endogenous protein and injected antibodies. In fact, bioanalysis showed that there were significant amounts of SAB-301 in serum on Day 4 in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, this response is not considered an adverse effect of SAB-301, but is simply the increased presence of globulin in the blood stream after the administration of the test article.
 Toxicokinetic analysis was performed on the measurable serum concentrations of SAB-301 in male and female rabbits after an intravenous infusion at dose levels of 50 and 370 mg/kg. There were non-linear increments in Cmax and AUCinf with a dose increase from 50 to 370 mg/kg. Mean apparent V values (33.4 to 80.6 ml/kg) indicate distribution of SAB-301 primarily in the vascular compartment. Females had a 60% greater exposure of SAB-301 at the higher dose (370 mg/kg), possibly due to a slower clearance rate in this group and formation of antibodies to SAB-301 in males.
 In conclusion, a single intravenous infusion of SAB-301 over 30 minutes to male and female New Zealand White rabbits did not produce overt adverse effects and did not have any target organs of toxicity. Therefore, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAB-301 was not determined but we believe it to be greater than 370 mg/kg (4440 mg/m2) for a single intravenous dose administration in rabbits. The NOAEL of SAB-301 is considered to be at least 370 mg/kg (4440 mg/m2) for a single intravenous dose administration in rabbits.


First-in-Man Clinical Safety and Efficacy
 The first-in-man clinical trial of SAB-301for MERS-CoV, conducted in 2017 and sponsored by the NIH, evaluated safety of this Tc Bovine-derived human polyclonal. The study was a blinded, placebo controlled, ascending dose study in healthy adults that investigated doses of 1.5 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg of intravenously administered product in 38 participants that were followed for 90 days post-infusion. The conclusion was that SAB-301 was safe and well tolerated. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated a half-life of the anti-MERS-CoV human polyclonal antibodies of 28 1/2 days, which is the reported half-life of human-derived IgG antibodies in humans.
 Importantly, anti-drug antibodies, or antibodies to ligands used in our DiversitAb purification process, or anti-bovine plasma protein antibodies were not detected.

Another clinical study conducted in 2017 at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, showed an initial indication of efficacy in Tc Bovine-derived anti-Mycoplasma human polyclonal antibodies in an immunosuppressed 68-year-old man diagnosed with a M. hominis septic polyarthritis who developed a chronically draining right hip fistula following a failed hip replacement surgery. The fistula is shown on the lower left above. He was treated with human-derived intravenous immunoglobulin and antibiotics for seven years during which time the mycoplasma became multi-antibiotic resistant. At the request of the patient and his physician, we produced the anti-mycoplasma human polyclonal therapeutic which was intravenously administered to the subject at doses up to 100 mg/kg as shown in the center table above. This was done under an FDA allowed Phase 1b study. The human polyclonal antibody product was well tolerated, and the subject’s mycoplasma load fell to undetectable levels with rapid healing and closure of the fistula as shown on the lower right.
 The patient then elected to undergo a repeat hip replacement surgery and he developed a Staphylococcus Aureus and other bacteria wound infection including mycoplasma. The patient was then re-treated with the Tc Bovine-derived human polyclonal antibodies which resulted in marked reductions in mycoplasma load as shown in the center table. This remarkable case study demonstrates the potential utility of Tc Bovine-derived human polyclonal antibodies to treat serious antibiotic resistant infections in general, but also the potential opportunity to produce specific human polyclonal antibody therapeutics to treat individuals with intractable infections using a personalized medicine approach.
 

Pipeline Programs
 We are leveraging our DiversitAb platform to advance a robust pipeline of differentiated antibody-based therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases and immune system disorders. We are focused on developing, with partners or on our own, product candidates where we believe a differentiated human polyclonal approach has the greatest potential to be either first-in-class against novel targets or best-in-class against known, but complex, targets to treat diseases with significant unmet medical needs, including infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and influenza, immune system disorders, including T1D, organ transplantation and early discovery oncology.
 We believe route of administration is also an important component of the ability to access specific markets. While we are currently testing our lead programs using intravenous administration, we are pursuing the development of alternate routes of administration as an expansion of our market reach. These include intramuscular and other administration methods.
The following summarizes the status of the therapeutic candidates in our current pipeline:
 



SAB-185 (anti-SARS-CoV-2)
 SAB-185 is a fully-human, specifically targeted, highly potent, and broadly neutralizing human polyclonal antibody therapeutic candidate for COVID-19. SAB-185, generated from the full-length spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain, has shown neutralization of the Munich, Washington, South African, Delta, Lambda, and other variant strains in preclinical and nonclinical studies. In addition, recent data has demonstrated that SAB-185 retains neutralization activity against the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in an in vitro pseudovirus model. Preclinical data has shown SAB-185 to be significantly more potent than human-derived COVID-19 convalescent IgG. We have completed multiple clinical and nonclinical studies to date, including a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers, and a Phase1b and Phase 2 clinical trial, both in COVID-19 patients. SAB-185 was being assessed in Phase 3 clinical trial as part of the ACTIV-2 master protocol, sponsored, funded and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (the NIH) in collaboration with the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG). On February 28, 2022, the NIH decided to terminate the ACTIV-2 program after determining that the decrease in hospitalizations resulted in operational futility and made it impossible to demonstrate statistically significant clinical efficacy with the existing study design.
 We have advanced SAB-185 in collaboration with the U.S. Government, as part of the Countermeasures Acceleration Group, formerly Operation Warp Speed. We filed the IND application, produced the initial clinical doses and entered the Phase 1 clinical trial in just 128 days from the program initiation. SAB-185 was designed and developed without the need for human convalescent plasma or human B-cell donations.
 We continue to work with multiple U.S government collaborators to evaluate a number of options for the continued evaluation and testing of SAB-185, including advanced clinical development, targeting specialized populations, such as the immune compromised, and alternate routes of administration.
In addition, we will review the data from the Phase 3 portion of the ACTIV-2 program and expect the full data readout for the Phase 2 NIH ACTIV-2 trial to be available Mid-2022.
 COVID-19 Background
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illness in animals or humans. In humans there are several known coronaviruses that cause respiratory infections. These coronaviruses range from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2).
 COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and its numerous variants, caused a global pandemic in 2020 that rapidly advanced throughout the world and has resulted in over 435 million cases and more than 5.9 million deaths as of March 1, 2022. SARS-CoV-2’s genome encodes a spike protein common to all members of the coronavirus family. Neutralizing antibodies to this spike protein are associated with protection from infection and disease and, as a result, this spike protein is the primary target for currently available vaccines and monoclonal antibodies therapies.
 The emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants have created significant concern with respect to therapeutics and vaccines to prevent and treat COVID-19. Some of the variants result in increased transmissibility and have shown resistance to current therapies that rely on neutralizing antibodies. These variants include the Omicron and Delta variants which have been identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as Variants of Concern given their potential severity of illness and associated death and their increased transmissibility. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has indicated that some monoclonal antibody treatments may not be as effective against infection with Omicron and the FDA has revoked the emergency use authorization for certain monoclonal antibody therapies. The FDA’s decision was based on the fact that COVID-19 variants had been shown to be resistant to such therapies, resulting in the increased risk for treatment failure.
 The Omicron variant continues to be the dominant variant today. Certain variants have caused reinfections in individuals with pre-existing antibody responses due to prior infection or vaccination, indicating that pre-existing antibodies do not necessarily fully protect against these variants.


Alternative Treatments and Limitations
Vaccines for Prevention of COVID-19
 Several vaccines have been authorized for the prevention of COVID-19 under public health emergency guidelines in the United States and worldwide, including vaccines created by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech utilizing mRNA as well as adenovirus-based vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and Janssen (a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson). While these vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in preventing COVID-19, we believe that a vaccine alone approach is not going to be fully effective to address the COVID-19 pandemic because of several factors, including:
•Current and future variants may be resistant in whole or in part to current vaccines. 
 •Vaccines do not provide immediate protection as the neutralizing antibody response resulting from available vaccines takes approximately 10 to 14 days after the final dose of the vaccine. 
 •Immunocompromised individuals may not respond sufficiently to the neutralizing antibody response of the vaccines because of the limitations inherent in compromised immune systems. 
 •Negative perceptions of vaccine safety continue to prevent a significant portion of the U.S. and world populations from accepting the vaccine as a safe and effective prophylactic. 
 •The duration of vaccine protection is approximately six months and booster shots are recommended periodically to provide protection against new variants. 
 Monoclonal Antibodies for Treatment of COVID-19
 A small number of monoclonal antibody treatments (either as a monotherapy or a combination cocktail) have been granted emergency use authorization in the United States and are available for use in certain EU member states for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in certain patient populations. The recent emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants has impacted the efficacy of these treatments and the FDA has revoked the emergency use authorization for certain monoclonal antibody therapies. The FDA’s decision was based on the fact that COVID-19 variants had been shown to be resistant to such therapies, resulting in the increased risk for treatment failure.
 Antiviral Small Molecule Drugs for Treatment of COVID-19
Molnupiravir is a polymerase inhibitor, which works by stopping the virus’s genetic material from being replicated accurately, causing the enzyme that replicates the virus’ RNA to inserts errors or mutations, which then get replicated many times until the virus can no longer survive. Research suggests drugs similar to molnupiravir can affect other enzymes in the body when given for longer periods of time and was of concern for the 13-10 vote from the FDA advisory committee.
 Paxlovid is made up of two components, an experimental molecule called PF-07321332 and a drug called ritonavir, which is also used in some drugs to treat HIV. Both components are protease inhibitors, meaning they block an enzyme that cuts apart long strands of nonfunctional viral proteins into smaller, functional proteins thus making viral proteins non-functional.
Our Rationale for the Development of SAB-185 Polyclonal Antibody for Treatment of COVID-19
We began development of SAB-185 around the middle of March 2020, when the seriousness of the pending pandemic became evident. We immediately procured DNA sequences of the full-length spike protein and began DNA immunization of the Tc Bovine. DNA from the immunizations incorporated into the cells of the Tc Bovine and began producing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein that initiated and immune response in the animals. The animals were immunized twice with the DNA immunization, three weeks apart. During this time, we developed a full-length spike protein that was delivered to the Tc Bovine three weeks after the second DNA immunization. Plasma was collected from these animals on day 8, 11, and 14 after this third spike protein immunization. The plasma was pooled and used as the raw material to purify the anti-SARS-CoV-2 human polyclonal antibodies in our proprietary purification process. The initial clinical lot was released in June 2020, the pre-clinical studies were completed, and the Initial New Drug Application was filed on July 6, 2020, with FDA agreeing to allow the start of the Phase 1 and Phase 1b clinical trials on July 31, 2020.


Phase 3 Trial
 The Phase 3 portion of the NIH ACTIV-2 trial, initiated in in early October, 2021, was designed as a randomized, open-label, active comparator-controlled platform study assessing the clinical safety and efficacy of SAB-185 at a dose of 3,840 unit/kg (approximately 750 mg total dose in a 100 kg human) compared to active control monoclonal cocktail antibody treatment in people with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at higher risk for progression to hospitalization. The Phase 3 trial enrolled approximately 750 participants to receive the investigational agent SAB-185 and 750 to receive an active comparator with primary outcome measures including safety and non-inferiority for the prevention of a composite endpoint of either hospitalization or death from any cause through study day 28.
 On February 28, 2022, the NIH decided to terminate the ACTIV-2 program after determining that the decrease in hospitalizations resulted in operational futility and made it impossible to demonstrate statistically significant clinical efficacy with the existing study design. More information on the ongoing Phase 3 trial can be found at the ClinicalTrials.gov website (Identifier: NCT04518410).
 Phase 2 Trial
 The Phase 2 portion of the trial for SAB-185 began in the second quarter of 2021. ACTIV-2 is a COVID-19 master protocol sponsored and funded by the NIH, in collaboration with the AIDS Clinical Trials Group. The Phase 2 trial was in ambulatory patients, with 110 participants in each of two cohorts, and a control group.

 In September 2021, we announced that the DSMB had completed its prespecified interim analysis data review of the safety and efficacy of SAB-185 in the Phase 2 portion of the NIH ACTIV-2 trial and recommended advancement to Phase 3 based on meeting pre-defined graduation criteria.
Both the lower dose of 3,840 units/kg (approximately 750 mg total dose in a 100 kg human) and the higher dose of 10,240 units/kg (2000 mg total dose in a 100 kg human) of SAB-185 tested in Phase 2 met the pre-defined efficacy goal for advancement to Phase 3 and appeared safe at the interim analysis. NIH and SAB researchers decided to assess the lower SAB-185 dose in Phase 3.
 We expect the full final data readout from the NIH ACTIV-2 Phase 2 trial to be available Mid-2022.
Phase 1 Trials
The Phase 1 trial, started in July 2020, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of four cohorts consisting of a total of 28 subjects, at dose levels of 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg on two occasions, or 50 mg/kg of SAB-185, or normal saline. All subjects have concluded their participation. A description of this study can be found at the ClinicalTrials.gov website under the identification code of NCT04468958. The primary endpoint(s) were the incidence and severity of adverse events and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) or transfusion-related adverse events at day 29. Secondary endpoints included the incidence and severity of adverse events and SAEs through day 90, among others. The DSMB monitored adverse events after each cohort was infused. The DSMB recommended that each later cohort could be infused with the next highest dose according to the study protocol. No SAB-185-related SAEs were identified by the DSMB, though some anticipated adverse events were noted in both the SAB-185 and placebo participants. Interim aggregate data from the 10mg/kg and 25mg/kg cohorts from this study, including safety data, were submitted to the FDA.
 The Phase 1b trial, started in August 2020, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of three cohorts consisting of a total of 21 subjects, at dose levels of 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg of SAB-185 or normal saline. A description of this study can be found at the ClinicalTrials.gov website under the identification code NCT04469179. The primary endpoint(s) were the incidence and severity of adverse events and SAEs or transfusion-related adverse events at day 29. Secondary endpoints included the incidence and severity of adverse events and SAEs through day 90 and measurement of SARS-CoV-2 quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results of the naso/oropharynx at various times. The DSMB monitored adverse events after each cohort was infused and recommended that each later cohort could be infused with the next highest dose according to the study protocol. No SAB-185-related SAEs were identified by the DSMB though adverse events were noted in both the SAB-185 and placebo participants. Interim aggregate data from the 10mg/kg and 25mg/kg cohorts from this study, including safety data, were submitted to the FDA.
 After completion of the Phase 1 trials, the FDA allowed SAB-185 to progress into an adaptive COVID-19 Phase 2 as part of the ACTIV-2 master protocol, which can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov website under the identification code NCT04518410, sponsored and conducted by the NIH.


Preclinical Studies

In this study conducted at the University of Pittsburg in 2020, SAB-185 was compared to the highest titer convalescent plasma available using the plaque reduction neutralization titer needed to neutralize 100% of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These results suggest that SAB-185 is 40 times more potent than high titer convalescent plasma. This high titer, target specific human polyclonal antibody is achieved through our hyperimmunization strategy. These high titer human polyclonal antibodies cannot be achieved with convalescent plasma from human donors.



In this study conducted at Washington University School of Medicine in 2020, we evaluated the ability of three different lots of SAB-185 and an anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody to prevent SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants. The three different lots of SAB-185 and the monoclonal antibody were serially passaged in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus. As shown, no SAB-185 lots allowed the development of escape mutants. However, SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants developed in the presence of the monoclonal antibody indicated by the three red arrows, one of which includes an E484K mutant. This specific mutation that was lab generated is also a currently circulating mutation found in multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants of interest that are infecting humans globally.

Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein mutations have arisen and are infecting humans globally, and their impact on the effectiveness of both vaccines and immunotherapies is a growing concern. We have been collaborating with the U.S. Government COVID response throughout 2020 and 2021 to evaluate the ability of SAB-185 to neutralize these mutant strains using a pseudovirion assay developed and conducted at the FDA. In this study, the inhibitory concentration at 50% of SAB-185 was determined against pseudovirions containing mutations in the spike protein and compared to the wild-type virus, to determine the ratio between the two. As can be seen on the table above to the left in the IC50 ratio column, no significant impact on the IC50 ratio was observed for any of the tested mutant strains including the current most prevalent strain in the U.S., the Delta variant. This indicates that SAB-185 is retaining neutralization potency to these existing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and potentially future emerging variants. In addition, specific virus point mutations like the E484K mutation are known to escape some monoclonal antibody therapeutics, which is indicated on the heatmap to the right are all fully neutralized by SAB-185.
 

In addition, recent data has demonstrated that SAB-185 retains neutralization activity against the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in an in vitro pseudovirus model. The data were generated by scientists at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).

In this study, FDA researchers evaluated SAB-185 using a lentiviral-based pseudovirus assay conducted in a BSL2 environment that incorporates a stable 293T cell line expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). The results indicate that SAB-185 retains a potent ability to neutralize recombinant S protein lentiviral pseudovirus that mimics the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant.
Although SAB-185 retained potent neutralization of the Omicron variant, it did show a mild-moderate reduction in potency compared to the wild type. Due to the nature of human polyclonal antibodies, it is important to note that neutralization is only one component of overall efficacy which can potentially provide therapeutic benefit to patients. For example, polyclonal antibodies can effectively block receptors used for viral entry by binding to multiple epitopes on the receptor binding domain and activation of immune effector cells which are not evaluated in this study. The versatility of our platform also provides the capability to quickly add strains and adjust to new variants through strain change supplements to our regulatory filings.
 SAB-185 Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE)
Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) is a poorly understood phenomenon in which a viral disease can become much more severe or lethal after vaccination or after administration of antibodies against a virus. In the first half of 2020, we investigated the potential of SAB-185 to cause severe disease in a wild-type (WT) ferret model of mild disease after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Cohorts of WT ferrets (four cohorts, N=3 per cohort) were infused with 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg of SAB-185 (one log range in dose) or normal saline 15 hours prior to infection with a low-passage Munich strain of SARS-CoV-2 and followed for 14 days. The 1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 mg/kg SAB-185 doses in ferrets were selected to approximate potentially non-neutralizing SAB-185 antibody concentrations that would occur after multiple half-lives after a human received 5 to 20 mg/kg of SAB-185.
The results of the study indicated that SAB-185 treatment of the WT ferret cohorts did not cause acute toxicity, any mortality, or enhanced disease over the course of 14-day study. All groups and animals had mild disease, though individual animals had variations in measured clinical and scientific parameters.
SAB-185 Tissue Cross Reactivity Study
The objective of this study, conducted in 2020 in preparation for IND submission, was to evaluate the potential cross reactivity of biotinylated SAB-185 with cryosections from a full panel of human tissues. Two different lots (Lot Nos. A5303 and A5304) of biotinylated SAB-185 were compared. In order to detect binding, the biotinylated test articles, designated SAB-185-Bio (Lot No. A5303) and SAB-185-Bio (Lot No. A5304), were applied to cryosections of normal human tissues (at least 3 donors per tissue, where available) at two concentrations (35 and 10 µg/mL [Lot No. A5303] or 35 and 7 µg/mL [Lot No. A5304]). In addition, the test articles were substituted with a biotinylated polyclonal human IgG antibody, which has a different immunogenic specificity from that of the test articles, designated HuIgG-Bio (control article). Other controls were produced by omission of the test or control articles from the assay (assay control).
SAB-185-Bio (both Lot Nos. A5303 and A5304) produced weak to strong staining of the positive control material (SARS-CoV-2 RBD-His UV-resin spot slides [designated SARS-CoV-2 RBD]) at the higher concentration, with a reduction in staining intensity to weak to moderate at the lower concentration of SAB-185-Bio (Lot No. A5303) and comparable staining at the lower concentration of SAB-185-Bio (Lot No. A5304). SAB-185-Bio (Lot No. A5303) and SAB-185-Bio (Lot No. A5304) did not specifically react with the negative control material (human hypercalcemia of malignancy peptide, amino acid residues 1-34 UV-resin spot slides [designated PTHrP 1-34]) at either staining concentration. The control article, HuIgG-Bio, did not specifically react with either the positive or negative control materials. There also was no staining of the assay control slides. The specific reactions of SAB-185-Bio (Lot No. A5303) and SAB-185-Bio (Lot No. A5304) in all staining runs with the positive control material and the lack of specific reactivity with the negative control material, as well as the lack of reactivity of the control article, indicated that the assay was sensitive, specific, and reproducible.
No staining was present with SAB-185-Bio (Lot Nos. A5303 or A5304) in the human tissue panel examined. As SAB-185-Bio (Lot Nos. A5303 or A5304) bind to a viral protein not expected to be expressed in normal human tissues, this result was anticipated.
The results of the ADE and Tissue Cross Reactivity studies were submitted to the FDA for review as part of the IND request. The FDA allowed us to initiate a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults and a Phase 1b trial in ambulatory adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
SAB-176 (Severe Influenza)
SAB-176 is a multivalent, broadly neutralizing fully-human polyclonal antibody therapeutic candidate in development for the treatment or prevention of severe influenza. This novel, specifically targeted high-potency immunotherapy leverages the natural human immune response and is designed to bind and neutralize both Type A and Type B influenza, including emerging and mutating strains. It may also be modified to address annual strain changes when needed. Nonclinical data suggests that SAB-176 offers broad protection against diverse influenza strains, even those that were not specifically targeted, potentially because of its strong cross-reactive potencies to conserved epitopes. We have completed multiple clinical and nonclinical studies to date, including a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers, and a Phase 2a challenge study that was initiated in June 2021. SAB-176 has the potential to complement seasonal vaccine programs, to achieve better efficacy than small molecule anti-influenza antivirals in the general population, to avoid development of resistant strains and to serve as a protective prophylactic in high-risk populations. This promising therapy is well-suited to address highly mutating viruses that have significant annual health impacts as well as pandemic potential.
Influenza Market
Seasonal influenza remains a meaningful burden for the healthcare system. While the influenza season differs each year, the CDC estimates there are on average 9 – 41 million cases of influenza each year, with 140,000 – 710,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 – 52,000 deaths per year (average 2010-2020). Oseltamivir phosphate (branded: Tamiflu®) is an effective therapy for treating the flu if used within two days of onset. However, some patients still develop severe disease and are resistant to treatment (estimates of resistance vary: 3-27%). As such, we see the potential for an additional treatment for flu, particularly in higher-risk patients.
While the severity of influenza is challenging to forecast year to year, for simplicity’s sake, we assume a consistent incidence rate of 30 million cases in the U.S., within the average range of the last ten years. In the 2020/2021 influenza season, cases and hospitalizations were down markedly (approximately 60% and 90%, respectively), as many or more of the vulnerable patients contracted COVID, rather than influenza. It is our expectation that influenza is globally persistent and case rates are expected to come back to historical levels in the coming years. We expect that at the time of launch, there will be approximately 30 million cases of influenza in the U.S. annually, about half of which will require a medical visit.
Phase 2a Challenge Trial
In December 2021, we announced topline data for a Phase 2a challenge trial that was initiated in June 2021. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and treatment efficacy of SAB-176 in 60 healthy adults challenged with a pandemic influenza virus strain (pH1N1). Participants were randomized to receive either SAB-176 (25 mg/kg dose) or placebo and were intranasally inoculated with pandemic H1N1 (2009/California) virus. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken 8 days after inoculation.
The primary endpoint of the study was reduction of the nasopharyngeal viral load of subjects treated with SAB-176 (expressed as area under the curve, or AUC) compared to those receiving placebo over an 8-day timepoint as measured by qRT-PCR. SAB-176 met the primary endpoint of significantly reducing patient pH1N1 influenza viral load in the treated subjects (p = 0.026, one sided).

A secondary endpoint of the challenge study was reduction of clinical flu signs and symptoms in the subjects receiving active treatment (n=8) compared to placebo controls (n=12) for those who had signs and symptoms. SAB-176 achieved statistical significance in meeting the secondary endpoint at Day 4 (p = 0.013, one sided) in symptomatic patients. A full analysis and data readout is being prepared and expected in the first half of 2022.
In this study, SAB-176 also appeared to be safe and well tolerated. No SAB-176-related SAEs were observed, and most adverse events were mild to moderate.
 Phase 1 Trial
SAB-176 was evaluated in an ascending dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 safety trial in 27 healthy volunteers in 2020. The FDA allowed us to initiate a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults based on the safety profile in the preclinical data set. A Safety Review Committee (SRC) monitored adverse events after each cohort was infused and recommended that each later cohort could be infused with the next highest dose according to the study protocol. Although anticipated adverse events were noted among the SAB-176 and placebo participants, no drug related SAEs were identified by the SRC.
Preclinical Studies

A pre-clinical study, conducted at Utah State University in 2017, demonstrated the ability of our anti-influenza human antibodies (an earlier, non-optimized candidate designated SAB-149) to produce cross-reactive antibodies to mutating influenza strains we did not initially target. The panel to the left is phylogenetic tree or ancestral map of the B Yamagata seasonal influenza strain. Specifically highlighted are the 2013 B/Phuket/ strain used to produce antibodies from our platform and its distant relative from 2006, the B/Florida strain which we used as the challenge strain in a lethal mouse model in the panel to the left. As shown here, the antibodies provided 100% protection down to 12.5 mg/kg demonstrating cross-protection to current and future emerging flu variants due mutational drift. This is a potential advantage of polyclonal antibodies and our platform.


One of the areas of growing concern with small molecule antivirals used to treat influenza is neuraminidase inhibitor resistance. For this reason, new treatments for influenza are needed. In this study conducted at the University of Utah in 2019, the in-vivo efficacy of SAB-176 compared to a human-derived antibody product and the small molecule, Oseltamivir was assessed in a lethal mouse model after challenge with an Oseltamivir resistant pandemic H1N1 strain. Five mg/kg of SAB-176 provided 100% protection while 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg of the human-derived anti-influenza antibody or oseltamivir did not. This suggest that SAB-176, at very low doses, could be effective in the treatment of humans infected with neuraminidase resistant or non-resistant H1N1 influenza.
SAB-176 Tissue Cross Reactivity
The objective of this study conducted in 2019 was to determine the potential cross reactivity of biotinylated SAB-176, a polyclonal human IgG antibody directed against influenza virus, with cryosections of human and rabbit (New Zealand White) tissues. To detect binding, the biotinylated test article, designated SAB-176-Bio, was applied to cryosections of normal human tissues (at least three donors per tissue, where available) and rabbit tissues (at least two animals per tissue, where available) at two concentrations (20 and 2 µg/mL). In addition, the test article was substituted with a biotinylated human IgG antibody, which has a different immunogenic specificity from that of the test article, designated HuIgG-Bio (control article). Other controls were produced by omission of the test or control articles from the assay (assay control).
SAB-176-Bio produced weak to strong staining of the positive control material (rHA1-H1N1 [A/Cal/07/09]-His [recombinant hemagglutinin protein] UV-resin spot slides [designated rHA1-H1N1]) at both concentrations. SAB-176-Bio did not specifically react with the negative control material (human hypercalcemia of malignancy peptide, amino acid residues 1-34, UV- resin spot slides [designated PTHrP 1-34]) at either staining concentration. The control article, HuIgG-Bio, did not specifically react with either the positive or negative control materials. There also was no staining of the assay control slides. The specific reactions of SAB-176-Bio in all staining runs with the positive control material and the lack of specific reactivity with the negative control material, as well as the lack of reactivity of the control article, indicated that the assay was sensitive, specific, and reproducible.
No staining was present with SAB-176-Bio in the human panel examined. As SAB-176-Bio binds to an influenza virus protein not expected to be expressed in normal human tissues, this result was anticipated. In the rabbit tissue panel, staining with SAB-176-Bio was restricted to the cytoplasm of rare epithelial cells in hair follicles in the skin. Binding to cytoplasmic sites in tissue cross-reactivity studies generally is considered of little to no toxicologic significance due to the limited ability of antibody drugs to access the cytoplasmic compartment in vivo. (Hall, et al., Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biopharmaceuticals: A Science-Based Approach to Facilitating Clinical Trials. Wiley-Interscience; 2008. p. 208-40 and Leach et. al. Toxicol Pathol 2010 December;38(7):1138-66.)
SAB-176 Toxicology
The objectives of this study, conducted in 2019, were to determine the potential toxicity of SAB-176 for the treatment of Type A and Type B influenza illnesses, when given as a single intravenous infusion to rabbits and to evaluate the potential reversibility of any findings. In addition, the toxicokinetic characteristics of SAB-176 were determined.
The following parameters and end points were evaluated in this study: clinical signs, body weights, body weight gains, food consumption, ophthalmology, clinical pathology parameters (hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), toxicokinetic parameters, immunogenicity analysis, gross necropsy findings, organ weights, and histopathologic examinations.
There were no test article-related effects noted on clinical signs, body weights, body weight gains, food consumption, ophthalmology, gross necropsy findings, organ weights, or histopathologic examinations.
There were no test article-related adverse effects on clinical pathology parameters. Decreased leukocytes (WBC) (down to 0.82X), lymphocytes (0.74X), monocytes (0.61X), eosinophils (0.50X), basophils (0.57X), and large unstained cells (0.73X), as well as increased neutrophils (1.2X) were noted in test article-treated females on Day 1 when compared to concurrent controls. These differences improved, but most were still present on Day 3 of the study. By Day 50, these values were similar to that of concurrent controls. Decreased activated partial thromboplastin time (0.76X and 0.80X) was noted in test article-treated females on Day 3 and Day 50 when compared to concurrent controls. Increased globulin (up to 1.59X) with associated decreased albumin to globulin ratio was noted in test article-treated males and females on Day 3 when compared to concurrent controls. These differences were not noted on Day 50.
In conclusion, administration of SAB-176 by single intravenous infusion was well tolerated in rabbits at levels of 362.65 and 725.30 mg/kg/day. No target organs were observed. Based on these results, the no-observed-adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be 725.30 mg/kg/day.
SAB-176 was assessed in IND-enabling studies including Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) tissue cross reactivity and toxicology studies. The results were submitted to the FDA for review as part of the IND submission.
SAB-142 (Organ Transplant & Type 1 Diabetes)
We are currently advancing therapeutic candidates through its SAB-142 program for organ transplant induction and organ transplant rejection, as well as a related program to address T1D. We are also conducting an undisclosed autoimmune target research effort under a research collaboration agreement with CSL Behring. The collaboration is exploring the potential of new therapies to treat challenging autoimmune and idiopathic diseases using polyclonal antibodies generated by our DiversitAb platform. We are sharing research program and related costs with CSL Behring. The collaboration may lead to subsequent development and commercialization agreements.
Potentially Significant Opportunity in Transplant
SAB-142 is a fully-human anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) candidate for preventing organ transplant rejection. Current approved ATG products are sourced from animals, including transplant market leader rabbit-derived Thymoglobulin, and equine-derived ATGAM. A human ATG alternative has the potential for higher potency without toxicity, presenting a potential opportunity to redefine the standard of care. Dosing advantages of a human ATG may include a longer half-life and potential for repeat dosing, without significant potential to generate serum sickness or anaphylaxis, which can be caused by the presence of animal proteins in the current therapies.
Despite broad use, there are several limitations of approved ATG products. Risks of serum sickness and anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation have limited use of animal ATG products, with rates of serum sickness >30% and repeat dosing not recommended. Therefore, physicians typically reserve its use for immune induction or acute rejection – but not both. A human alternative such as SAB-142 is expected to have several advantages over ATG animal antibody products. In the established transplant market, a human ATG that has a reduced risk of adverse events such as serum sickness has the potential to penetrate the current market and expand existing clinical use.
SAB-142, has demonstrated a comparable profile in vitro to approved animal ATG products–equine-derived ATGAM and rabbit-derived Thymoglobulin. The Tc Bovine-derived human ATG has also demonstrated higher potency compared to Thymoglobulin in vitro. We expect to show improved safety, dosing, and efficacy profiles for our human ATG program in future human studies.


This is a flow cytometry analysis of a gated lymphocyte cell population comparing SAB-142 to the two FDA approved and commercially available rabbit and horse ATG products on the market. As you can see, SAB-142 binds to the same T-cell population as both rabbit and horse ATG antibodies, suggesting comparable mode of action.



We further explored the mode of action of SAB-142 against T-cell subsets. SAB-142 had higher CD8 killing activity compared to the rabbit antibody and had similar performance in survival of T-regulatory cells, induction of activated CD4 T Cells, and reduction of naïve CD4 cells. These in vitro results strongly suggest that SAB-142 may have the potency attributes needed for transplant induction and rejection therapy while having the impactful product advantage of an improved safety profile. The product attributes of SAB-142 are potentially also well aligned to address the desired safety profile of ATG treatments that have been shown to be beneficial in treating T1D.
Therapeutic Potential in New-Onset Type 1 Diabetes
A potentially significant application for SAB-142 is for the delay or prevention of the onset of T1D, a serious lifelong autoimmune disease. T1D affects 1.6 million people and there are 60,000+ new diagnoses each year in the U.S. alone. The full potential of agents such as Thymoglobulin to delay or prevent T1D is limited by the unsuitability of animal products for repeat dosing. SAB-142 represents an opportunity to offer a novel fully human alternative to rabbit- or equine-derived ATG antibodies, that has the potential for re-dosing and avoids current risk factors such as serum sickness, anaphylaxis, and loss of efficacy of currently available therapies. Based on results of a Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by Dr. Michael Haller at the University of Florida, a single dose of rabbit ATG (Thymoglobulin) showed sustained benefit in T1D over two years by maintaining significantly higher C-peptide levels (a marker of pancreatic beta cell function) than placebo controls. However, more than 65% of treated patients in this study acquired serum sickness due to infusion of an animal antibody (rather than human) that included rash, 3-4 days of malaise, fever, and joint swelling. The symptoms often required treatment with steroids that worsens diabetes management and reduces capacity to give the rabbit ATG again as C-peptide levels begin to drop as shown in the graph below. In addition to potentially preserving beta cell function in early T1D patients, a human ATG like SAB-142 could open the possibility of re-dosing when clinically meaningful indicators such as C-peptide levels and glycosylated hemoglobin blood tests indicate worsening disease, without the potential risk of inducing the major immune reactions that can occur with fully-animal antibodies.


We have commenced initial IND-enabling studies. we plan to initiate additional IND-enabling studies for SAB-142 in the fourth quarter of 2022, pending availability of appropriate study models.
 Oncology (Undisclosed Targets)
 We have the potential to develop polyclonal therapeutic candidates that address multiple aspects of cancer. We are pursuing undisclosed target opportunities for which we expect to release early developmental data in the second quarter of 2022.
 We believe that the DiversitAb platform may to lead to oncology applications for our polyclonal antibodies because of our potential to address mutations, polymorphisms, and resistance pathways. Our human polyclonal antibodies may offer advantages as cancer therapies, including:
 •Multi-targeting – Ability to simultaneously target multiple modalities of cancer in a single product.
 •Multivalency – Leverages native immune response – polyclonal antibodies – with binding to multiple epitopes to address mutations.
 •Metastasis Prevention – Literature suggests human polyclonal IVIG antibodies may help prevent tumor metastases.
 •Effector Function – Enhanced effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement dependent cytotoxicity.
 •Replicability – Developed antibodies against a variety of oncology targets using our DiversitAb platform.
 We have recruited and deployed an oncology-focused team with the goal of pioneering polyclonal antibodies for use in treating cancer. We have filed several patent applications and expect to demonstrate initial proof-of-principle in oncology in the second quarter of 2022.
 

Government Contracts and Collaborations
We have collaborated extensively with U.S. Government agencies within both the Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). We are executing an award from Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense (JPEO – CBRND) Joint Project Lead for Enabling Biotechnologies (JPL-EB) (hereafter JPEO-EB) within the DOD that includes co-funding from the Defense Health Authority and from BARDA (within HHS). The award currently totals up to approximately $200 million. The scope of the award includes proof-of-concept, scaling and live-fire of a Rapid Response Antibody Program leveraging our response capabilities and was expanded to include our COVID-19 therapeutic, SAB-185, as part of the Countermeasures Acceleration Group (formerly Operation Warp Speed). That expansion included significant capacity growth, addition of capabilities, and expansion of infrastructure including human resources and facilities.
The use of SAB-185 in the ACTIV-2 trial is sponsored, funded and conducted by the NIH and we are not required to bear any of the costs of this clinical trial.
Manufacturing Strategy
In support of our operations, we currently operate two plasma fractionation purification facilities in Sioux Falls, South Dakota: a 50L scale cGMP suite that has produced clinical grade drug product, and a 200L scale clean room that was completed in 2021 and is currently being validated to produce clinical grade drug substance and drug product. The 200L facility is expected to generate drug product in 2022.
 In addition, we maintain substantial laboratory facilities and operations in Sioux Falls, South Dakota for product development and testing, quality control and discovery. We recently initiated our own internal immunogen development capabilities and significantly scaled production capacity to accommodate the Tc Bovine immunizations required for SAB-185 production. We have also recently initiated an expansion of our research and development laboratory facilities to accommodate expansion in oncology research, clinical testing, and discovery.
Our Tc Bovine are housed at dedicated specialty facilities that cater to the production, health, safety, and welfare of the animals, and provide plasma production at commercial scale for our products. The upstream process is easily scalable. Animals donate plasma three times per month (2.1% of bodyweight each time). To produce more product, more animals must be immunized for a target.
Advanced clinical product for SAB-185 was produced at CSL Behring. We are presently engaged in discussions with additional third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture commercial drug substance and drug product at commercial scale.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change as research provides a deeper understanding of the pathology of diseases and new technologies and treatments are developed. We believe our scientific knowledge, technology, and development capabilities provide us with substantial competitive advantages, but we face potential competition from multiple sources, major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and existing or emerging biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions worldwide.
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, robust drug pipelines, established presence in the market and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified clinical, regulatory, scientific, sales, marketing, and management personnel, in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
We face competition from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies that have or are pursuing the development of antibody treatments, including Adagio Therapeutics, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Brii Biosciences Limited, Celltrion Healthcare Co, Ltd., Eli Lilly and Co, GlaxoSmithKline, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. In addition, we may face competition from many established pharmaceutical companies focused on developing vaccines, oral antivirals, and other therapeutics.
If any future product candidates identified through our current lead programs are eventually approved for sale, they will likely compete with a range of treatments that are either in development or currently marketed for use in those same disease indications. Our success will partially depend on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce, and defend patents and other intellectual property rights with respect to our antibodies that are proven to be safer or more effective or are less expensive than competing products. We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, better tolerated, more effective, more convenient to administer, less expensive, more resistant to viral escape, or receive a more favorable label than our product candidates.
Intellectual Property
We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology platform that we believe is important to our business, which includes seeking and maintaining patents covering our technology platform and products, and any other inventions that are commercially or strategically important to the development of our business. We also seek to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property”.
The portfolio of intellectual property and trade secrets that we have developed includes patents related to the activity of our human artificial chromosome and methods that we expect to generate fully human antibodies at commercial scale. The patent portfolio includes composition and method patents. Our goal is to continue expansion of the breadth of claims and length of claim protections. Our patented technologies may be difficult to replicate, creating potential barriers to entry, as our genetic engineering know-how and suite of proprietary platform IP and trade secrets have been developed and optimized over nearly two decades.
We expect our global patent protection to extend beyond 2033 with respect to producing commercial scale human antibodies using our chromosome engineering that generates high concentrations of human antibodies in ungulates. However, we recognize that the area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, which may affect those rights.
Our patented technologies may be difficult to replicate, creating potential barriers to entry, as its genetic engineering know-how and suite of proprietary platform IP and trade secrets has been developed and optimized over nearly two decades.
As of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio includes over 40 issued patents or pending applications in 12 patent families. We have made strategic filings in jurisdictions in jurisdictions include the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, India, Mexico and Russia, in these 12 patent families.

 The term of any individual patent depends upon the legal term of the patent in the country or countries (or jurisdiction, e.g., the European Union) in which it is obtained.


U.S. Patent Regulatory Regime
 In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may potentially be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. PTO in examining and granting a patent considering delays on the part of the patentee or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We expect to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel and our business model and needs are always considered. We file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, assuming these are strategically valuable. We may periodically reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending and issued patent claims to ensure that coverage and value are obtained for our processes, and compositions, given existing patent law and court decisions. Further, claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs.
We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on several factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention, and the ability to satisfy subject matter, written description, and enablement requirements of the various patent jurisdictions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our future product candidates or for our technology platform. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties.
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and/or continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors, or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting trade secrets, know-how and inventions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”


The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the U.S. PTO to determine priority of invention. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
U.S. Patent Term Restoration
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a biologics license application (BLA) less any time the sponsor did not act with due diligence during the period, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application less any time the sponsor did not act with due diligence during the period. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension, only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. Moreover, a given patent may only be extended once based on a single product. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Government Regulation
In the United States, we expect our polyclonal antibody product candidates to be regulated by the FDA as biological products. Additionally, in manufacturing our product candidates, we alter the genomic DNA in animals, and FDA considers such altered genomic DNA in an animal to be a new animal drug, which require submission and approval of a New Animal Drug Application (NADA) prior to being marketed in the United States.
Regulation of Transgenic Animals and New Animal Drugs
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates the company’s Tc Bovine husbandry activities, including housing, healthcare, and general management of these specialized animals. This includes regulations and periodic facility inspections and reporting. We also are voluntarily accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). The AAALAC International accreditation program evaluates organizations that use animals in research, teaching or testing. Those that meet or exceed AAALAC standards are awarded accreditation. The accreditation process includes an extensive internal review conducted by the institution applying for accreditation.
The FDA considers, with limited exclusions, the altered genomic DNA in an animal to be a drug because such altered DNA is an article intended to affect the structure or function of the body of the animal, and, in some cases, intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in the animal. In the United States, new animal drugs are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, and under the FD&C Act, in general, a new animal drug is “deemed unsafe” and adulterated unless the FDA has approved a new animal drug application (NADA) for its intended use or unless the drug is only for investigational use and conforms to specified exemptions for such use under an investigational new animal drug (INAD) exemption. Further, early in the development process, FDA has allowed the submission of information to FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), without the establishment of an INAD file, such as through creation of a veterinary master file (VMF), subject to certain conditions such as restrictions on introducing any food derived from such investigational animals into the food supply.


The requirements governing development and approval of a new animal drug are analogous to those for new human drugs. A NADA must generally be accompanied by payment of a substantial user fee and must contain substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the new animal drug as well as detailed descriptions of the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the manufacturing, processing and packaging of the new animal drug to enable FDA to reach a determination that such methods, facilities and controls are adequate to preserve the identify, strength, quality and purity of the new animal drug. Further, when FDA reviews and approves a NADA, FDA generally conducts a review of environmental risks pursuant to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), if any and where required.
The steps involved in completing the INAD/NADA process are cumulative and risk based with each component of the assessment forming the basis on which the next step is evaluated.
Step 1: Product Identification
Product identification (21 CFR 514.1(b)(1)), which many molecular biologists would refer to as product definition, forms the foundation for the evaluation process and drives subsequent data generation and review. It encompasses the specific GE animal (that is, the article as well as the GE animal containing it) and the purpose (i.e., intended use) of the article that is the subject of the NADA.
Step 2: Molecular Characterization of the Construct
This step of the process serves to describe the components and composition of the article. (21 CFR 514.1(b)(4).)
Step 3: Molecular Characterization of the GE Animal Lineage
This step continues the analysis of the rDNA construct in the resulting GE animal, as well as the production of the GE animal(s) intended to be used in commerce and any potential hazards that may be introduced into those animals as part of their production.
Step 4: Phenotypic Characterization of GE Animal
The previous steps of the review process have concentrated on establishing and characterizing the rDNA construct and its integration into the resulting GE animals. Information in this and the following steps helps establish whether the GE animal poses any risks to humans, risks to health of the GE animal, or risks to the environment.
Step 5: Genotypic and Phenotypic Durability Assessment
As in Step 3, this step also addresses some additional components of the manufacturing requirements codified in 21 CFR 514.1(b)(5). It is intended to provide information to ensure that the rDNA construct in the GE animal resulting from the specific transformation event and defining (identifying) the GE animal being evaluated is durable — that there is a reasonable expectation that the rDNA construct is stably inherited, and the phenotype is consistent and predictable.
Step 6: The Food/Feed Safety and Environmental Safety Assessments
Food/Feed Safety
This portion of step 6 addresses the food and feed safety requirements in 21 CFR 514.1(b)(8). It focuses on the issue of whether food or feed derived from a GE animal is safe for humans or animals consuming edible products from the animals.
Environmental Safety
This portion of Step 6 addresses the environmental component of an NADA. 21 CFR 514.1(b)(14). GE animal applications have to be evaluated to determine whether such an application individually or cumulatively affects the environment (i.e., whether an extraordinary circumstance exists). 21 CFR 25.21. An Environmental Assessment that demonstrates the GE animal will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment leads to a finding of no significant impact (FONSI).
 Step 7: Effectiveness/Claim Validation
The previous steps of the review process primarily address identity and safety issues. This last step of pre-market review addresses effectiveness, i.e., whether the claims have been validated for the characteristics that the GE animal is intended to exhibit. 21 CFR 514.1(b)(8).

CVM manages the regulation of our Tc Bovine technology, and we engage in scientific and regulatory communications with CVM focused on SAB’s animal plasma as the source of drug substance and product. CVM has regulatory oversight of animals with intentional genomic alterations (IGA) to produce drugs and biological products intended for human use.
This is a one-time approval process for a platform technology that may produce multiple targeted products in the future that would be regulated by another Center at FDA (i.e., CBER).
CVM has regulatory responsibility for veterinary and food safety issues associated with final products and the use of IGA animals. CVM and other FDA Centers work interactively to regulate IGA animals and their products. Regulations 21 CFR, Parts 58, 210, 211, 600, 680 and 9 CFR, Parts 1, 2, 3 are applicable to aspects of production or disposition of these IGA animals. CVM has Guidance 187 for Regulation of Intentionally Altered Genomic DNA in Animals for the regulatory oversight and approval process for IGA animals intended for production of biological products for human use, as well as CBER’s Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Testing of Therapeutic Products for Human Use Derived from Transgenic Animals (CBER 1995).
We have a longstanding relationship with CVM and have an Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD-011204) on file. Data and information on the safety and effectiveness of the genetic modifications of Tc Bovine are currently in the process of being submitted in a series of seven steps in accordance with Guidance 187 and under review by CVM. Once all steps are completed and reviewed by CVM, an administrative New Animal Drug Application (NADA) will be submitted for final review and approval. The current expectation is to have the NADA completed by the fourth quarter of 2022. We are also currently filing a new animal drug application (NADA) assessing the safety and effectiveness of the genetic modifications to the Tc Bovine animals with the CVM. This is a one-time process that includes future post approval responsibilities related to the durability of animal health and antibody response.
U.S. Biological Products Development Process
In the United States, biologic products are licensed by the FDA for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, (PHS Act), and regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Both the FDCA and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, efficacy, labeling, packaging, record keeping, storage, distribution, marketing, sales, import, export, reporting, advertising, and other promotional practices involving biologic products. FDA authorization is required prior to clinical testing of biologic products. FDA licensure also must be obtained prior to marketing of biologic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial financial resources and time.
Multiple polyclonal and monoclonal antibody products have been approved by the FDA to prevent or treat human diseases. Though the FDA regulates both monoclonals and polyclonal antibody products, Monoclonal antibodies are regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). A monoclonal antibody is characterized by its molecular structure. This approach is similar to the process that CDER uses to regulate small molecule drugs. Because monoclonals are designed to bind to a single epitope, mutation is a significant concern due to selective pressure. Polyclonal antibodies derived from animals or humans are regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). CBER has currently approved over thirty polyclonal products for commercial sale. Human and animal-derived polyclonals are characterized by their in vitro potency and not by the molecular structure of each antibody in the product. U.S. Development Process.
Hybrid Process for a Biological Product Is Developed from Animals with Intentionally Altered Genomic DNA
The process required by the FDA before a biologic product may be marketed in the United States is generally well documented. In the case of a product that is developed from animals with intentionally altered genomic DNA as the donor material source, the process is more complex and involves both CVM, to oversee the intentionally altered genomic DNA in animals and the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (OTAT) at FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to oversee the polyclonal antibody products.
However, this is a onetime process for our Tc bovine and does not have to be repeated for subsequent products produced by the Tc bovine containing the same HAC.
Key aspects of the process include the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs), and the Animal Welfare Act administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture; 
 •submission to CVM of an application for an INAD, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •preparation of clinical trial material in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs);
 •submission to the FDA of an application for an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), which must become effective prior to beginning any human clinical trials; 
 •approval of the protocol and related documentation by an institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site prior to initiation of each clinical trial; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information to establish the safety, purity, potency, and efficacy of the proposed biologic product for its intended use; 
 •preparation of and submission to CVM of a NADA for marketing approval that includes sufficient evidence of establishing the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed altered genome in animals for its intended indication, including from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 •submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, potency, and efficacy from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the NADA and BLA, unless a fee waiver applies; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection prior to a BLA approval of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product is produced to assess compliance with GMPs to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NADA and BLA; 
 •potential FDA Advisory Committee meeting to elicit expert input on critical issues, including a vote by external committee members; 
 •FDA review and approval of the NADA and BLA, which may be performed in parallel, but the NADA must be granted before a final decision can be made on the BLA, resulting in the licensure of the biological product for commercial marketing; and 
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 
 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs.


Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate developed from an animal with altered genomic DNA in the United States, an INAD must be submitted to CVM and an IND must be submitted to CBER, and the FDA must allow the INAD and IND to proceed. An INAD and IND are exemptions from the FD&C Act that allow an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA allowance that such investigational product may be administered to humans in connection with such trial. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration. In support of a request for an INAD, applicants must submit to the FDA the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit to the FDA a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted as part of an IND. An INAD and IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA allowance to begin a clinical trial.
Additionally, under the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines), supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee (IBC), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
Clinical trials may involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials involving some products for certain diseases may begin with testing in patients with the disease. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects or his or her legal representative provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. IRBs are charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and consider such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The biologic product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some biologic products for rare diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 •Phase 2. The biologic product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the biologic product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage, and dosing schedule. 
 •Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the biologic product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In biologics for rare diseases where patient populations are small and there is an urgent need for treatment, Phase 3 trials might not be required if an adequate risk/benefit can be demonstrated from the Phase 2 trial. 
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.


During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written INAD and IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with the use of biologics, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for biologic products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
There are also various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with the research. In each of these areas, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and withdraw approvals.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its clinicaltrials.gov website. Disclosure of the results of such trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Failure to timely register a covered clinical trial or to submit trial results as provided for in the law can give rise to civil monetary penalties and also prevent the non-compliant party from receiving future grant funds from the federal government. The NIH’s Final Rule on clinicaltrials.gov registration and reporting requirements became effective in 2017, and both NIH and FDA have recently begun enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors. Sponsors or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access requests.


U.S. Review and Approval Processes
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a NADA requesting approval of the altered genomic DNA in donor animals and a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort, and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or the PDUFA, each BLA may be accompanied by a significant user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most applications for approval of drug and biologic products is subject to an application user fee. The sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
Within 60 days following submission of a BLA or within 30 days following submission of a NADA, the FDA reviews the submitted application to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any application that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of an application to FDA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances.
Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA) for original NADAs, the FDA targets 180 days from the submission date in which to complete its initial review and act on a standard application. A NADA is considered incomplete if it would require additional data or information to enable the FDA to complete and reach a decision on issues presented in the NADA. Once the sponsor reactivates the NADA by addressing identified deficiencies, the FDA targets 135 to 180 days, depending in part on whether the deficiencies are identified as not substantial or substantial, respectively, to complete its review and respond to the applicant.
The sponsor of a new animal drug may voluntarily decide to utilize FDA’s “phased review” process to complete all technical sections required for approval of a new animal drug before submitting a NADA by submitting such information during the investigational phase of the animal drug development process. Utilizing this process, the sponsor may submit an administrative NADA, which is a NADA submitted after all technical sections necessary to fulfill the requirements for the approval of a new animal drug have been reviewed by the CVM and the CVM has issued a technical section complete letter for each of the required technical sections. The FDA targets 60 days from the filing date to complete its review and act on an administrative NADA.
Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NADA and BLA. The FDA reviews the applications to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to ensure its continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult or novel questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.


Before approving a NADA or BLA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money, and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
After the FDA evaluates a NADA or BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or for an NADA and BLA respectively, an Incomplete Letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. An Incomplete Letter or a Complete Response Letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NADA or BLA. Where the FDA determines that the data supporting a BLA are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue a Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing an Incomplete Letter or Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NADA or BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a NADA or a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or require additional testing or information.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, including to subpopulations of patients, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings precautions or interactions be included in the product labeling. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace.
Further, for biological products, the FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the biological product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Post-Approval Requirements
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to produce clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation.
Following approval, the manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, and such inspections may result in an issuance of FDA Form 483 deficiency observations, an untitled letter, or a warning letter, which can lead to plant shutdown and other more serious penalties and fines. Prior to the institution of any manufacturing changes, a determination needs to be made whether FDA approval is required in advance. If not done in accordance with FDA expectations, the FDA may restrict supply and may take further enforcement action. Annual product reports are required to be submitted annually. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse events, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA may conduct laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. Manufacturers of biological products must establish systems to record and evaluate adverse events reported by healthcare providers and patients and to assess product complaints. An increase in severity or new adverse events can result in labeling changes or product recalls. Defects in manufacturing of commercial products can result in product recalls.

We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or inpatient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or license revocation, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect.
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented, and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Additionally, rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of new animal drugs continues after approval. Owners of approved NADAs continue to have ongoing responsibilities under the FD&C Act, including registration and listing, recordkeeping, filing supplements, and periodic reporting.
Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of biological products that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new biological products to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for a fast-track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a biological product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast-track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.
The FDA may give a priority review designation, such as a rare pediatric disease designation, to biological products that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA’s review of an application is six months, rather than the standard goal of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Most products that are eligible for fast-track designation may also be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. In addition, biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the biological product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a biological product receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoints, and the biological product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.


Moreover, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biological product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biological product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all the benefits of fast-track designation, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. Drug and biological products designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Emergency Use Authorizations
While, in most cases, a biologic must be approved by the FDA pursuant to a BLA before the product may be sold, when there is a public health emergency involving chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agents, including infectious diseases like COVID-19, new therapeutics may be distributed pursuant to an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Under an EUA, the FDA may authorize the emergency use of an unapproved medical product or an unapproved use of an approved product for certain emergency circumstances to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, and after the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has issued a declaration of emergency or threat justifying emergency use. EUAs are intended to address serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent, including emerging infectious disease threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. To receive an EUA, the product sponsor must demonstrate that the product “may be effective” in the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of an applicable disease or condition. Additionally, the FDA must determine that the product’s known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks. Further there must be no adequate, approved, and available alternative product for the indication. Potential alternative products may be unavailable if there are insufficient supplies to meet the emergency need. The FDA may establish additional conditions on an EUA that are necessary to protect public health, including conditions related to information that must be disseminated to health care providers and patients, the monitoring and reporting of adverse events, and record keeping. Conditions may also relate to how a product is distributed and administered and how a product is advertised. Importantly, EUAs are not full marketing approvals. Rather, EUAs are only effective for the duration of the applicable EUA declaration. Full approval of the product under applicable standards established under the FDCA would be necessary to continue to distribute the product absent an EUA. EUAs may also be revised or revoked by FDA at any time.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or 200,000 or more individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Pediatric Trials
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biologic product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (ACA), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed reference biological product via an approved BLA. Biosimilarity to an approved reference product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form and strength and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity is demonstrated in steps beginning with rigorous analytical studies or “fingerprinting,” in vitro studies, in vivo animal studies and generally at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of the HHS. The biosimilarity exercise tests the hypothesis that the investigational product and the reference product are the same. If at any point in the stepwise biosimilarity process a significant difference is observed, then the products are not biosimilar, and the development of a stand-alone BLA is necessary. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. Under the BPCIA, a reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
In addition to exclusivity under the BPCIA, a biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, including some regulatory exclusivity periods tied to patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will continue to be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies.
In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application (CTA), must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with the applicable requirements, clinical study development may proceed. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies are to a significant extent harmonized at the European Union level but could vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. On January 31, 2022, the European Union's (EU's) Clinical Trial Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 536/2014) became effective. The Regulation harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the European Union via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized European Union portal and database. We expect the Regulation to have significant material changes to clinical trials conducted or proposed to be conducted in the European Union.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, except for, among other things, country-specific document requirements. Innovative products that target an unmet medical need may be eligible for several expedited development and review programs in the European Union, such as The Priority Medicines (PRIME), scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the United States. Such products are generally eligible for accelerated assessment and may also benefit from different types of fast-track approvals, such as a conditional marketing authorization or a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances granted on the basis of less comprehensive clinical data than normally required (respectively in the likelihood that the sponsor will provide such data within an agreed timeframe or when comprehensive data cannot be obtained even after authorization).
The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. A Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), in the European Union is aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the authorization of a medicine for children, through studies in children. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines must include the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. This requirement also applies when a marketing-authorization holder wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form, or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights. Several rewards and incentives for the development of pediatric medicines for children are available in the European Union. Medicines authorized with the results of studies from a PIP included in the product information are eligible for an extension of their supplementary protection certificate by six months, even when the results of the studies are negative. Scientific advice and protocol assistance at the EMA are free of charge for questions relating to the development of pediatric medicines. Medicines developed specifically for children that are already authorized but are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate are eligible for a pediatric-use marketing authorization, which if granted, provides 10 years of market protection.


Beginning on January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), became the U.K.’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales and Scotland (together Great Britain). Northern Ireland continues to follow the European Union regulatory regime, but its national competent authority remains the MHRA. The MHRA has published a draft guidance on how various aspects of the U.K. regulatory regime for medicines operate in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland following the expiry of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020. The guidance includes clinical trials, marketing authorizations, importing, exporting and pharmacovigilance and is relevant to any business involved in the research, development or commercialization of medicines in the U.K. The new guidance has been given effect via the Human Medicines Regulations (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, or the Exit Regulations. The U.K. regulatory regime largely mirrors that of the European Union.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Authorization Procedures in the European Union
Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
•Centralized Procedure. Under the Centralized Procedure a so-called Community Marketing Authorization is issued by the European Commission, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA. The Community Marketing Authorization is valid throughout the entire territory of the European Economic Area (EEA) (which includes the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland). The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. 
 •For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. 
 •National Authorization Procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for investigational drug products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 
 •Decentralized Procedure. Using the Decentralized Procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure the applicant chooses one country as Reference Member State. The regulatory authority of the Reference Member State will then be in charge of leading the assessment of the marketing authorization application.
 •Mutual Recognition Procedure. In the Mutual Recognition Procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 
 In the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.

Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing, and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exits as to obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our product candidates, including SAB-185 and SAB-176, and the extent to which patients will be willing to pay out-of-pocket for such products in the absence of reimbursement for all or part of the cost. In the United States and in other countries, patients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. The availability of coverage and adequacy of reimbursement for our products by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE), managed care providers, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other organizations is essential for most patients to be able to afford medical services and pharmaceutical products such as our product candidates. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a payor-by-payor basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage or adequate reimbursement. The principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent products will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.
Third-party payors determine which products and procedures they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Even if a third-party payor covers a particular product or procedure, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate. Patients who are treated in-office for a medical condition generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the procedure, including costs associated with products used during the procedure, and may be unwilling to undergo such procedures in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement. Physicians may be unlikely to offer procedures for such treatment if they are not covered by insurance and may be unlikely to purchase and use our product candidates, if approved, for our stated indications unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate. In addition, for products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs.
Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon several factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that a procedure is safe, effective, and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals; included in clinical practice guidelines; and neither cosmetic, experimental nor investigational. Further, increasing efforts by third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, we may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Our product candidates may nonetheless not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. There may be pricing pressures from third-party payors in connection with the potential sale of any of our product candidates. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
Foreign governments also have their own healthcare reimbursement systems, which vary significantly by country and region, and coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available with respect to the treatments in which our product candidates, if approved, are used under any foreign reimbursement system.


Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value; 
 •Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs; 
 •The federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; 
 •The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions; 
 

•The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives; 
 •Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and 
 •The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage to obtain or retain business. 
 Many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and state laws that require drug and biologics manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. Additionally, to the extent that any of our products, if approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.


Healthcare Reform
The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs and biologics. In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs and biologics administered by physicians. CMS also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs and biologics. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA was a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the ACA expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs and biologics, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of average manufacturer price (AMP), which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the ACA. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. Since that time, there have been significant efforts to modify or eliminate the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act"), enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), commonly referred to as the individual mandate.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the ACA. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to COVID-19 relief legislation, the 2% Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Since enactment of the ACA, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or have been effectively repealed through Executive Orders and/or executive agency actions. However, following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the ACA’s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although the new federal administration under President Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the ACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for health insurance subsidies under it. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect the biopharmaceutical industry as a whole or our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices, and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry in the U.S.


The ACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs and biologics to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Furthermore, the law requires manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the “donut hole.” The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA), among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans by increasing from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D.
The ACA also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The ACA expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the ACA. Because the 340B ceiling price is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition could cause the required 340B discounts to increase. Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives as well. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the way manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that additional federal, state, and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.


Our Corporate History
SAB Sciences, Inc. (formerly SAB Biotherapeutics, Inc.) was incorporated in April 2014 as a Delaware corporation ("Legacy SAB"). We acquired all the intellectual property rights to Tc Bovine and the DiversitAb platform from Sanford Applied Biosciences, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanford Health, to develop targeted human polyclonal antibodies to specific targets and advance clinical development and commercialization. The technology was originally contemplated in 1998 by professors at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Amherst College who recognized a significant gap in immunotherapy applications, namely, using the natural way our bodies fight disease through a human polyclonal antibody response. The technology founders established a biotech company called Hematech to develop the technology. This founding company was purchased and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Kirin in Tokyo, Japan in 2005. In 2007, the pharmaceutical division of Kirin became Kirin Pharma and in 2008 merged with Kyowa Hakko Kogyo to become Kyowa Hakko Kirin (KHK). The technology was developed through 2012 by Hematech as a wholly owned subsidiary of KHK. On December 31, 2012, KHK divested the technology and transferred ownership of all property, assets, and intellectual property of Hematech to Sanford Health and the technology was further developed by Sanford Applied Biosciences until we acquired it in its entirety in June 2014.
Since acquiring the technology in 2014, we have continued to develop intellectual property and specifically targeted human polyclonal antibodies to multiple disease indications, and we have conducted or collaborated in eight clinical trials (six of which are ongoing or in review), where we have demonstrated safety and efficacy in multiple Tc Bovine-derived human polyclonal antibody product candidates. We have developed our rapid response capabilities and completed proof of concept using private resources as well as over $200 million of funds awarded from the U.S. Government emerging disease and medical countermeasures programs. In October 2021 we completed our business combination with Big Cypress Acquisition Corp., pursuant to which we debuted as a publicly traded company (the "Business Combination").
Big Cypress Acquisition Corp. ("BCYP") was incorporated as a special purpose acquisition company in the State of Delaware on November 12, 2020. On January 14, 2021, BCYP completed its initial public offering. On October 22, 2021, BCYP consummated the Business Combination with Legacy SAB, which changed its name from SAB Biotherapeutics, Inc. to SAB Sciences, Inc. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, BCYP changed its name to SAB Biotherapeutics, Inc. and SAB Sciences, Inc. became a subsidiary of SAB Biotherapeutics, Inc.
