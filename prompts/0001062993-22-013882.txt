ITEM 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
We are an acquisition-oriented, U.S.-based medical device holding company operating through several wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries.  In May 2021 and September 2021, respectively, we acquired our subsidiaries South Dakota Partners, Inc., a South Dakota corporation ("SDP"), and Simbex, LLC, a New Hampshire limited liability company ("Simbex") and in November 2021 we formed a new subsidiary, ALG Health Plus, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("ALG Health Plus"), as a result of which we became engaged in the production and sale of medical devices and products, certain of which are proprietary and white label.  Our products include devices used for pain management, cold and hot therapy, NMES, PEMF and ultrasound as well as wearable technology and products used to enhance physical stability.
We intend to achieve scale through further acquisitions and organic growth. We place an emphasis on products for people over the age of sixty-five, which demographic provides steady demand by virtue of government sponsored medical coverage in the U.S. Our current operations are focused predominantly in the business of recovery science, technologies that help individuals prevent and recover from surgery and disease. We expect to continue to expand our business in recovery science as we continue to explore acquisitions within and adjacent to this business vertical.
Our common shares trade on the TSXV under the symbol "SGMD." Our registered office is Suite 200E - 1515A Bayview Avenue, East York, Ontario and our headquarters are located at 3330 Caminito Daniella, Del Mar, California, 92014.
Unless otherwise noted, all figures in this report are reported in Canadian Dollars.
Plan of Operations
Our primary objective is to become a leading supplier, producer and developer of medical device products ‎through both organic growth and through acquisitions.
Growth Plan
We anticipate that our acquisition-oriented growth strategy will leverage the Canadian capital markets to target smaller U.S.-based private medical device companies by offering stock and cash to acquire such companies and ‎integrate them into a large, broad-based medical device company.‎  Through this growth strategy, we intend to increase our overall revenue and profits and therefore earnings per share by (a) ‎increasing revenues through international distribution by seeking to leverage management's existing sales distribution networks in ‎Europe, Australia and other markets to increase sales for each acquired company; (b) increasing our product lines ‎by developing, in-licensing or acquiring new intellectual property protected devices synergistic with the acquisitions; and (c) ‎increasing profits through operational integration in an effort to reduce supply chain risks and increase cash flow and margin‎.
Acquisition Pipeline
Subsequent to our fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, in March 2022, we acquired Mio-Guard, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company ("Mio-Guard") which is engaged in medical device sales and marketing serving the Midwest United States, through a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary.  Mio-Guard and its predecessors had 2021 unaudited annual revenues of approximately $4.5M (US $3.6M) with 25% gross margins.  Since 2009, the team at Mio-Guard has sold into the athletic training, physical therapy and orthopedics markets for sports medicine products. Mio-Guard has over fifty sales representatives in the United States with a focus on the Midwest, South and Central United States and long-standing relationships with institutions ranging from high school to college to professional athletics. Additionally, our management team has a pipeline of small, privately held, stand-alone and bolt-on medical device companies targeted for acquisition in the highly fragmented global market for injury, surgical prevention, rehabilitation and recovery for the aging population throughout the continuum of care, which fall into one of three primary categories:
• Private smaller medical device companies struggling with sufficient capitalization and operational expertise to fully realize the value of their intellectual property;
• Niche players that succeed in developing a handful of quality products often turn to larger listed companies that do not allow ownership to participate in the upside of including their device in a larger company; and
• Smaller U.S.-listed companies that lack liquidity and coverage to offer sufficient upside to vendors.
We believe we are well positioned to offer acquisition targets upside through stock/cash acquisitions with a liquid TSXV listing.
We intend to acquire any identified medical device targets using a structure similar to our acquisition of SDP, Simbex, ALG and Mio-Guard.  It is intended that potential targets would primarily or solely receive Company equity as consideration for the potential acquisition rather than cash, which would reduce our requirement for additional capital. Additionally, to date, discussions are most advanced with targets that are operationally cash flow positive, which may enhance our ability to borrow for additional capital needs.
Milestones
We expect to use our available working capital to finance identified and complementary acquisitions, and for general working capital. Our immediate short-term objectives will be to evaluate and acquire additional complementary medical device companies to expand our distribution networks and product lines.
Our long-term objectives will be to:
• leverage sales distribution networks to expand our distribution channels;
• increase our product lines by developing, in-licensing or acquiring new intellectual property protected devices synergistic with the identified acquisitions; and
• increase profits through operational integration in an effort to reduce supply chain risks and increase cash flow and margin.
OUR OPERATIONS 
South Dakota Partners, Inc.
Overview
Based in Clear Lake, South Dakota (the "Clear Lake Facility"), our subsidiary, South Dakota Partners, Inc. ("SDP") is a packager, producer and seller of private white-label medical devices in the United States, primarily focusing on devices for pain management, cold and hot therapy, TENS, NMES, PEMF and ultrasound therapy.‎ The United States represents roughly 40% of the global medical device market (SelectUSA: Medical Technology Spotlight: The Medical Technology Industry in the United States) with organic growth opportunities by virtue of a growing aging population. Recent threats of disruption in international trade markets, whether from trade disputes, pandemic or geopolitical factors, have made some companies seek to diversify sources of supply to include firms with operations in the United States, presenting another opportunity for organic growth.  The United States is a heavily regulated market, and as a result, medical device businesses that operate in the United States require expertise in the fields of compliance, production, product design, packaging, marketing and more. SDP's overall strategic plan has been to position itself as a respected, reliable, and successful partner offering production, packaging, marketing and other ancillary services within the medical device industry. 
Products
Production Line of Services: The majority of SDP's revenue is derived from services related to production, production planning, shipping, and packaging and servicing products. SDP offers an end-to-end solution for the supply chain within the medical device industry. SDP not only assists in the development of medical device products but also provides the layout and design of the entire production process of a device, from sourcing to final fulfillment, which requires expertise from engineers of many different disciplines, compliance experts, and technical experts. This process often includes the production of specialized automated robotic systems for use in reducing cost and increasing efficiency and fidelity of the process. A typical onboarding starts with the outlining of customer expectations, current projected annual volumes, and order frequency. Once this information is assessed, SDP works with the customer to establish the resources required for design transfer, new infrastructure needs (if any), new equipment needs (if any) and supply chain details, and to evaluate potential risks. Once the logistical concerns have been assessed and considered, SDP commences a technical data review, during which it reviews the technical documentation provided by the customer to assess for accuracy, develops a full product specification and production plan, develops a product traceability and recall plan and ensures compliance with ‎relevant regulatory and labeling requirements, to the extent they are already in place. Following completion of its technical review, SDP's production engineering and quality engineering teams commence the process of establishing new supply chains, production ‎cells, protocols and begin the prototypic phase, if necessary. Once the initial phases are complete, SDP enters the production readiness phase to verify standard operating procedure (SOP) sufficiency and pilot procedures to ensure production meets necessary quality standards. Finally, SDP's production team will then commence process validation to train employees, prepare relevant procedures, and troubleshoot issues discovered in pilot production runs before undertaking the full production process of a device.
Service & Sales Product Line: The process of servicing equipment and providing customer assistance is one that is often labor intensive and requires expertise, particularly when working with complex and sensitive technologies. Many medical device companies prefer to have these services offered by the very same experts who design and produce the devices. SDP offers repairs on damaged or malfunctioning products as well as the ability to interface and troubleshoot devices and answer questions from potential customers‎, the device end users. SDP only offers these services to end users of the devices produced by SDP. SDP offers these services to both domestic and international customers.
Fulfillment Service Line: Many medical device designers or producers lack the expertise, capacity, and bandwidth to contend with a growing and deeply fragmented customer base. SDP offers management of the interface with customers down to final fulfillment and tracking. Once production is complete, SDP will store products for existing customers that it has already sold to them in order to maintain, track and ultimately deliver finished goods directly to end users. What seems on its face to be a simple process, becomes increasingly difficult as the number of product variants increases and the number of outgoing deliveries increases into the hundreds or thousands.
SDP's product line is designed to remove all but the development of intellectual property and sales channels from the purview of its customers. SDP's goal is to reduce the complexity and burdens of medical device operations of its customers once the technology has been developed by reducing cost, streamlining operations, managing quality to six sigma standards, and managing the end user interface. SDP believes that it is the only U.S. domestic company to offer such a wide and focused scope of services ‎and products to its clients. Within ‎the medical device market in which SDP operates, SDP focuses upon: TENS, NMES, PEMF, ultrasound, therapy supplies, combo devices, traction ‎devices, laser treatment, hot/cold therapy, muscle stimulation, wound care, and bone growth, which are explained in greater detail below. End ‎users of SDP's products include healthcare professionals, physical therapists or patients, however, SDP only contracts directly with the supplier of the products and not end users.
The services provided by SDP for its customers are part of an integrated service package, which is typically governed by a single agreement. As such, these services account for the vast majority of SDP's revenues. SDP's remaining revenue is derived from sales of scrap, obsolete inventory, and other customer prompted liquidation events. ‎These events often occur during the development process for a new iteration of a product. To date, all SDP sales ‎have been made to arm's length customers.
Technologies
The products that SDP produces and operates its other services around, are predominantly focused on the pain management and post-surgical care space. The technologies used are myriad but some of the most important technologies are laid out below:
Transcutaneous Electronic Nerve Stimulation (TENS): This technology operates by running electricity directly through the patient's skin to interfere with the typical functioning of neurons key to the pain feedback cycle. This technology falls into the much broader class of electronic stimulation products, which are SDP's specialty focus. These products have been around for some time and are generally well accepted in the medical community and by the FDA. SDP focuses primarily on producing large, capital equipment variants of these products typically used by physicians in their offices and workplaces as opposed to home use by the patient. The ultimate service provider will often bill an insurance provider for the use of the equipment on the patient.  Some patients pay for these services directly, and may or may not later seek reimbursement from an insurance provider.Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Technology (PEMF): This technology operates by generating magnetic fields around the device stimulating the activation of various cell types within patients. These products do not require the electrodes and wires of TENS products (although some manufacturers do make use of this delivery method) as magnetic fields do not need assistance in passing through the patients' skin. This technology was originally developed for use in bone stimulation but has since been applied to other issues as well in compliance with FDA rules and regulations. PEMF is part of the broader electronic stimulation device grouping. The ultimate service provider will often bill an insurance provider for the use of the equipment on the patient.  Some patients pay for these services directly, and may or may not later seek reimbursement from an insurance provider.Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES): This technology utilizes similar systems as TENS. An electrical current is passed through the skin of the patient using electrodes. However, the goal and specifics of this technology are used not to interfere with nerve signaling, but to instead cause muscle contraction of a targeted muscle or muscle group. This technology is often used in rehabilitation of muscles post-surgery as well as for post-workout recovery in athletes. NMES is also a part of the larger electronic stimulation device grouping. The ultimate service provider will often bill an insurance provider for the use of the equipment on the patient.  Some patients pay for these services directly, and may or may not later seek reimbursement from an insurance provider. 


Hot/Cold Therapy: Hot and cold therapy has been a mainstay of recovery sciences for a very long time. The majority of this equipment is not regulated by the FDA medical device regulations; however, it is ubiquitous in its usage in the recovery sciences. Hot and cold therapy used in conjunction or separately, is used by both individual patients, sports trainers and medical practitioners to relieve pain, enhance recovery, and reduce swelling. The manufacture and development of these products requires specific knowledge and production strategies to create appropriate gel matrices, which are typically proprietary, to create a safe and effective product.Laser Treatment: The use of lasers of various wavelengths in healthcare is a somewhat more recent development with applications having been approved by the FDA for everything from the recovery sciences to cosmetic procedures. SDP specializes in working with laser medical device products that cater to the recovery science space. These products are usually delivered directly to practitioners for use on a patient. The effects of each specific laser product vary greatly across the wavelength and intensity spectrum.Continuous Passive Motion (CPM): CPM devices are used in post-surgical recovery, typically related to repair and/or damage to joints. Often in the recovery process it is important that a limb be moved to prevent excessive formation of scar tissue. CPM devices serve to fill this need by passively moving a limb during the recovery process without assistance from the patient. These devices are typically not owned by individual patients but are supplied by practitioners who then bill a patient's insurance provider for use of the equipment.
The majority of SDP's revenue is derived from supply agreements with its customers, none of which expire within twelve ‎months of the date hereof,  however, they do contain cancellation provisions, both ‎for cause and upon notice. Among those, SDP derives a significant amount of its revenue from two principal supply agreements. If either of these Supply Agreements were to be canceled, the reduction in revenue and ‎profitability would have a material adverse effect on SDP's business. In the event of the cancellation of a contract by a key customer, SDP anticipates that it would use ‎any notice period to reduce payroll and costs in order to mitigate against any adverse effects of such cancellation.
Entities domiciled in the United States, such as SDP, are required to comply with federal, state and local environmental regulations.  All waste is ‎disposed of in compliance with EPA regulations. To date, SDP has never received a notice regarding ‎violation of any environmental law or regulation. SDP is not aware of any restrictions on ‎profit repatriation.  Future political or economic conditions may affect any business, but SDP ‎is not aware of any specific economic or political risks relevant to its products or services.  SDP expects that recession or depression would adversely affect its business. Although SDP generally does not sell directly to consumers, any decision by the government to restrict or ‎reduce public or private health insurance would be expected to reduce demand in the healthcare ‎industry generally, including the business of SDP.‎
SDP employs various experts to ensure compliance with FDA regulatory matters, Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor ("OSHA") regulatory matters, restriction of hazardous substance directive in electrical and electronic equipment ("RoHS") ‎regulatory matters, and other production and healthcare regulators. SDP also employs ‎experienced process, design, and production engineers who have the expertise to design, plan for ‎and actually produce compliant medical device products.
SDP may, from time to time, import ‎goods or raw materials produced in other nations, and a disruption of the supply from other nations, ‎or even other U.S.-based suppliers, could slow production and reduce revenues. As of the date of this report, SDP does not have any ‎foreign investments. ‎ 
Production Controls and Quality
The Clear Lake Facility is FDA Registered and ISO 13485:2016 certified.  SDP manages all internal and external activities following the in place Quality Management System to ensure compliance with the requirements of ISO 13485:2016, current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and drives continuous improvement using lean and six sigma tools.
SDP is vertically integrated and can build many of its products from the raw material level up. The internal automation teams have automated many production processes. Much of the automation has been specifically designed by SDP engineers for their customers. This automation serves as an additional barrier to entry as it makes it difficult for competitors to be competitive on cost and quality.
All SDP suppliers are approved by its quality and procurement teams. SDP manages the activities of the supply chain daily. SDP's procurement team partners directly with suppliers to find new materials and processes that will improve its products and services.
SDP designs many of its own testing processes, engages in design for manufacturability activities on new and existing products and has partnerships with several design companies to help with product design.
All SDP employees are trained in lean and six sigma methodologies.
Regulatory
The FDA, Health Canada, and comparable agencies in other foreign countries impose requirements upon the design, development, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of medical devices.  The applicable regulations require that the device owner obtain clearance or approval before the devices can be sold. After the applicable approvals and/or clearances are granted, the regulatory agencies require companies to comply with quality system requirements, investigate complaints, report and investigate certain adverse events and device malfunctions, comply with marketing restrictions and maintain annual registrations.
SDP is registered with the FDA as a contract manufacturer and as an importer of medical devices, and it maintains a quality system that is certified to ISO13485:2016.  SDP's specific responsibilities are defined in written quality agreements with its customers.  In general, SDP is responsible for investigating complaints and providing the results of the investigation to its customers.  The customers are responsible for reporting adverse events to appropriate regulatory authorities.
Market
SDP services medical device companies with operations across the globe. The largest ‎concentration of customer orders is delivered to the U.S. operating arms of customers. The U.S. ‎healthcare industry continues to grow rapidly as the population of 65+ individuals continues to climb.  The U.S. healthcare industry is often seen as acyclical or recession resistant due to the critical nature of its services.  The ‎market is currently estimated at $195 billion (US $156 billion) and expected to grow to $261 billion (US $208 billion) by 2023 (Source: selectusa.gov‎.).
SDP strives to iterate and improve its products based on customer needs.  However, SDP's products are not reliant on a single technology, process, or patent and as such is not ‎subject to substantial obsolescence risk from a single technological innovation.‎
In the United States, facilities that build medical devices ‎and the medical devices themselves must be cleared by the FDA.  The level of rigor involved with this ‎clearance process depends on the devices themselves as there are various levels of clearance. As an entity that operates within the U.S. medical device space, SDP employs FDA regulatory experts to ensure facility and product compliance with all ‎appropriate regulations.‎
Marketing Strategies
SDP sells through reputation, word of mouth and contacts known within the industry.  To date, all of SDP's sales ‎have been with arm's length customers.
