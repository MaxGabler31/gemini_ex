Business Highlights 
 
Major Events in 2018 
 
In February 2018, the Company closed on an additional 33% ownership interest in Soundperience, bringing its total ownership to 49% and its total investment to 1,500 Euros, as of December 31, 2018, consisting of an equity investment and license agreement. Subsequently, in January 2019, the Company purchased the source code for the Sentibo Smart Brain self-fitting software from Soundperience for 1,829 Euros, positioning the Company to capitalize on the pending over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aid regulation. Sentibo Smart Brain self-fitting software is designed to improve both channel productivity and the quality of first-time fittings, resulting in lower prices, greater access and increased customer satisfaction. This software is being used in the German market today, most notably through Signison, the Company’s joint venture with the majority owner of Soundperience. In addition, the Company transferred its 49% ownership interest in Soundperience to the majority owner of Soundperience. As of December 31, 2018, Soundperience and Signison are accounted for in the Company’s financial statements using the equity method.
 
In March 2018, the Company entered into a new 5-year lease for an additional 37,000 square foot manufacturing and clean room facility near our Corporate Headquarters in Arden Hills, Minnesota. In addition, during 2018 the Company added 13 new molding presses, as well as a high-speed printed circuit board assembly line. In June 2018, the Company entered into an additional 10,000 square foot medical assembly space in Singapore. The added capacity and equipment will aid us in meeting the anticipated rising demand in our medical biotelemetry business. 
 
On August 20, 2018, the Company completed a public offering and sale of 1,725 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $55.00 per share less an underwriting discount of $3.30 per share. The net proceeds from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, totaled approximately $88,967 and were used to repay debt, fund capital expenditures, to repurchase 500 shares of common stock owned by directors and officers and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The amount of domestic and foreign bank debt repaid from the offering was $16,381. 
 
Major Events in 2017
 
In December 2017, the Company acquired the remaining 80-percent stake in Hearing Help Express, Inc. (referred to as “Hearing Help Express” or “HHE”), a direct-to-end-consumer mail order hearing aid provider, for $650 in cash, repayment of $1,833 in debt to HHE’s 80% holder and an earn-out. The results of HHE were consolidated into the Company’s financial statements beginning October 31, 2016. Prior to the acquisition of 100% ownership in December 2017, the Company allocated income and losses to the noncontrolling interest based on ownership percentage.
 
The Company entered into an agreement to acquire a 49% stake in Soundperience for 1,500 Euros. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had an investment in Soundperience of $1,415, consisting of a 16% ownership interest, cash advances and a license agreement.

Market Overview:
 
IntriCon serves the body-worn device market by designing, developing, engineering, manufacturing and distributing micro-miniature products, microelectronics, micro-mechanical assemblies, complete assemblies and software solutions, primarily for the medical biotelemetry market, the emerging value based hearing healthcare market, the hearing health direct-to-end-consumer market and the professional audio communication market. Revenue from these markets is reported on the respective medical biotelemetry, hearing health, hearing health direct-to-end-consumer and professional audio lines in the discussion of our results of operations in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 23 “Revenue by Market” to the Company’s consolidated condensed financial statements included herein.
Hearing Healthcare Market 
 
In the United States alone, there are approximately 40 million adults that report some degree of hearing loss. In adults, the most common cause of hearing loss is aging and noise. In fact, by the age of 65, one out of three people have hearing loss. The hearing-impaired population is expected to grow significantly over the next decade due to an aging population and more frequent exposure to loud sounds that can cause noise-induced hearing loss. It is estimated that hearing aids can help more than 90 percent of people with hearing loss, however the current market penetration into the U.S. hearing impaired population is approximately 20 percent, a percentage that has remained essentially unchanged for the last four decades. The primary deterrents to greater penetration are cost and access. Along with this, the legacy hearing aid distribution channel is an oligopoly of six large hearing aid manufacturers who utilize bricks and mortar and licensed audiologists to sell devices while controlling the channel dynamics. As a result, the average cost of a hearing aid sold in the US market today is over $2,400 per device, more than double the cost from fifteen years ago. Approximately 70 percent of the hearing impaired have hearing loss in both ears (referred to as a binaural loss), driving the total cost to almost $5,000 on average for a set of hearing aids.
 
Today in the US market, the legacy channel pushes all hearing impaired through the same inefficient, costly channel. However, a very large portion of the hearing-impaired market – mostly notably those with mild to moderate losses – could be properly served with the proper combination of high quality, outcome-based devices, advanced fitting software and consumer services/care best practices – all at much lower cost. We believe fundamental change is needed and are excited about the opportunity that we created through thoughtful hard work and planning: a chance to deliver superior outcomes-based affordable hearing healthcare, by combining state-of-the-art devices and software technology, along with best practices customer service and at a much lower cost directly to consumers across the country, many of whom have not been able to afford care previously.
 
We believe a perfect vortex of factors has come together over the last few years to enable the emergence of a market disruptive, high-quality, low cost distribution model. These factors include the continued consolidation of retail (causing escalating hearing aid prices), consumer outcry, consumer education, advancements in technology (such as behind-the-ear devices, advanced digital signal processing, low-power wireless, and self-fitting software) as well as regulatory actions and pronouncements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine.
 
In early January 2016, the FDA weighed in on low hearing aid penetration rates with an announcement that highlighted statistics from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. They found that 37.5 million U.S. adults aged 18 and older report some form of hearing loss. However, only 30 percent of adults over 70, and 16 percent of those aged 20 to 69, who could benefit from wearing hearing aids, have ever used them. Based on these statistics, the FDA reopened the public comment period on draft guidance related to the agency’s premarket requirements for hearing aids and personal sound amplifiers (PSAPs). In April 2016, the FDA hosted a public workshop to, among other things, gather stakeholder and public input on draft guidance related to the agency’s premarket requirements for hearing aids and PSAPs. The FDA’s intent was to consider ways in which it can most effectively regulate hearing aids to promote accessibility and affordability while encouraging innovation. In December 2016, the FDA announced important steps to better support consumer access to hearing aids. The agency issued a guidance document explaining that it does not intend to enforce the requirement that individuals age 18 and older receive a medical evaluation or sign a waiver prior to purchasing most hearing aids, effective immediately. It also announced its commitment to consider creating a category of over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids.

Furthermore, there have been significant public policy developments during 2017. On August 18, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, which includes a section concerning the regulation of OTC hearing aids. The law is designed to enable adults with mild to moderate hearing loss to access OTC hearing aids without being seen by a hearing care professional. The law requires the FDA to create and regulate a category of OTC hearing aids to ensure they meet the same high standards for safety, consumer labeling, and manufacturing protection that all other medical devices must meet. Additionally, the law mandates that the FDA establish an OTC hearing aid category for adults with “perceived” mild to moderate hearing loss within three years of passage of the legislation. The FDA also must finalize a rule within 180 days after the close of the comment period, detailing what level of safety, labeling and consumer protections will be included. We believe this law has the potential to remove the significant barriers existing today that prevent innovative hearing health solutions. We believe that this law will invigorate competition, spur innovation and facilitate the development of an ecosystem of hearing health care that provides affordable and accessible solutions to millions of unserved or underserved Americans. Today, IntriCon serves both the value-based hearing healthcare channel and the legacy hearing health channel.
 
Value-Based Hearing Healthcare 
 
The Company believes the value-based hearing healthcare (VBHH) market offers significant growth opportunities. In contrast to the legacy channel dynamics, the VBHH market channel is flexible and able to serve the end consumer through a variety of modalities which may include self-fitting, remote programing and adjustments, customer support call centers and bricks and mortar stores. The average price of a hearing aid sold through this channel is less than twenty-five percent of the average $2,400 device price typically sold through the legacy channel. The Company recently commissioned an ethnographic research study, which identified a $3+ billion annual VBHH market opportunity. In addition, this study assisted us in identifying our customer, various customer segmentations and personas. To best approach this market opportunity, we have focused our efforts to serve both the value-based Direct-to-End-Consumer (DTEC) and value-based Indirect-to-End-Consumer (ITEC) channels. Over the past decade we have invested in the manufacturing footprint, product technology and fitting software to provide individuals access to affordable, quality outcomes-based hearing healthcare.
 
Our DTEC represents a channel that sells products and services directly to the end consumer, which today consists of our HHE business. In December of 2017, we purchased the remaining 80% of HHE, a direct-to-end-consumer mail order hearing aid provider. However, the Company had been preparing to address this market long before the acquisition of HHE and has spent the last decade investing in the technology and low-cost manufacturing to design and build superior devices and fitting solutions. With this acquisition, we believe we now have the channel infrastructure to directly reach consumers and—importantly for millions—the ability to offer high-quality hearing healthcare at a fraction of the cost. The Company’s devices and technologies coupled with HHE’s high-touch care, outcomes based, and hassle free telemedicine model has created a complete eco-system of hearing healthcare in which the Company intends to serve the $3+ billion market. Through our other VBHH initiatives and tests, we have formed alliances with other key partners, which have given us experience and vital insight as we move aggressively into a more consumer-facing role. HHE provides an efficient, direct-to-end-consumer channel to reach consumers who likely do not have insurance covering hearing devices. This is a channel that we can build on and expand via technology—and one that is complementary with many of our existing relationships.
 
The Company is also focused on serving its value-based ITEC customers, who also sell products and services directly to the end consumer. We have established ourselves as a leader in supplying this portion of the market with advanced, outcome-based products and accessories. The Company has formed strong relationships with various customers in the channel, including insurance providers, and geriatric product retailers and other indirect-to-end-consumer hearing aid providers.
 
In January 2019, the Company purchased the source code for the Sentibo Smart Brain self-fitting software from Soundperience, positioning the Company to capitalize on the pending over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aid regulation. Sentibo Smart Brain self-fitting software is designed to improve both channel productivity and the quality of first-time fittings, resulting in lower prices, greater access and increased customer satisfaction. This software is being used in the German market today, most notably through Signison, the Company’s joint venture with the majority owner of Soundperience.

We strongly believe that incorporating self-fitting technology is a critical step in creating our high-quality, low-cost hearing healthcare ecosystem. The Sentibo Smart Brain self-fitting software technology has the potential to drastically reduce the price of hearing aids, drive greater access and increase customer satisfaction.
 
Legacy Hearing Health Channel
 
We also believe there are niches in the legacy hearing health channel that will embrace our outcomes-based products and technologies in the United States and Europe. High costs of legacy devices and retail consolidation have constrained the growth potential of the independent audiologist and dispenser. We believe our software and product offering can provide independent audiologists and dispensers the ability to compete with larger retailers, such as Costco, and manufacturer owned retail distributors.
Medical Biotelemetry
 
In the medical biotelemetry market, the Company is focused on sales of biotelemetry devices for life-critical diagnostic monitoring. The Company manufactures microelectronics, micro-mechanical assemblies, high-precision injection-molded plastic components and complete biotelemetry devices for leading and emerging medical device manufacturers. The medical industry is faced with pressures to reduce the cost of healthcare. Driven by its core technologies, IntriCon helps shift the point of care from expensive traditional settings, such as hospitals, to less expensive non-traditional settings like the home. IntriCon currently serves this market by offering medical manufacturers the capabilities to design, develop, manufacture and distribute medical devices that are easier to use, are more miniature, use less power, and are lighter. Increasingly, the medical industry is looking for wireless, low-power capabilities in their devices.
 
IntriCon currently has a presence in the diabetes, cardiac and catheter positioning markets. For diabetes, IntriCon works with Medtronic to manufacture their wireless continuous glucose monitors (CGM), sensor assemblies, and accessories associated with Medtronic’s insulin pump and CGM system. In August 2016, the FDA approved the MiniMed 630G system which is intended to replace Medtronic’s MiniMed 530G system. In September 2016, the FDA approved the next generation MiniMed 670G insulin pump system, into which IntriCon components are also designed. The MiniMed 670G is the world’s first hybrid closed loop insulin delivery system and we are excited that our components are designed into and support such a revolutionary diabetes management system. In June 2017, the 670G was launched in the U.S. and Medtronic began fulfilling orders from patients enrolled in their Priority Access Program. In parallel, Medtronic began taking new orders from interested customers who want to be next in line to receive the system after the Priority Access orders are filled. In March 2018, the FDA approved the Guardian Connect, Medtronic’s standalone CGM system that allows patients to stay ahead of high and low glucose events. Looking ahead, we believe there are opportunities to expand our diabetes product offering with Medtronic, as well as move into new markets outside of the diabetes market.
 
IntriCon has a suite of medical coils and micro coils that it offers to various original equipment manufacturing (OEM) customers. These products are currently used in pacemaker programming and interventional catheter positioning applications.
 
IntriCon manufactures bubble sensors and flow restrictors that monitor and control the flow of fluid in an intravenous infusion system as well as a family of safety needle products for an OEM customer that utilizes IntriCon’s insert and straight molding capabilities. These products are assembled using full automation, including built-in quality checks within the production lines.
 
During the first half of 2018, we expanded our infrastructure to support anticipated growth from current medical biotelemetry customers and future growth from increased business development. Expansion efforts in 2018 included a newly leased 37,000-square-foot medical biotelemetry manufacturing and clean room facility in Minnesota, an additional 10,000-square-foot medical assembly space in Singapore, 13 new molding presses and a high-speed printed circuit board assembly line. In addition to these investments, our current customers invested several million dollars in tooling and automation within our facilities. While we have begun limited production on certain products in our new facilities, we are still working with current medical biotelemetry customers to complete required validation and qualification of several key production lines.
 
The company is committed to increasing investments to support its medical biotelemetry business development efforts. In early 2019, the company hired a vice president of medical business development, to leverage our core competencies and diversify our medical revenue base. The company believes it has a significant opportunities to serve the emerging biotelemetry and home care markets through its already developed core competencies and capabilities to develop devices that are more technologically advanced, smaller and lightweight. 
 
To provide greater financial and operational focus, IntriCon made the strategic decision to divest its non-core cardiac diagnostic monitoring business in 2016. The Company sold this business on February 17, 2017 to Datrix, LLC.

Professional Audio Communications
 
IntriCon entered the high-quality audio communication device market in 2001, and now has a line of miniature, professional audio headset products used by customers focusing on emergency response needs. The line includes several communication devices that are extremely portable and perform well in noisy or hazardous environments. These products are well suited for applications in the fire, law enforcement, safety, aviation and military markets. In addition, the Company has a line of miniature ear- and head-worn devices used by performers and support staff in the music and stage performance markets. We believe performance in difficult listening environments and wireless operations will continue to improve as these products increasingly include our proprietary nanoDSP, wireless nanoLink and PhysioLink technologies.
Core Technologies Overview:
 
Our core technologies expertise is focused on four main markets: medical biotelemetry, hearing health, hearing health direct-to-end-consumer and professional audio communications. Over the past several years, the Company has increased investments in the continued development of five critical core technologies: Ultra-Low-Power (ULP) Digital Signal Processing (DSP), ULP Wireless, Fitting Software, Microminiaturization, and Miniature Transducers. These five core technologies serve as the foundation of current and future product platform development, designed to meet the rising demand for smaller, portable, more advanced devices and the need for greater efficiencies in the delivery models. The continued advancements in this area have allowed the Company to further enhance the mobility and effectiveness of miniature body-worn devices. 
ULP DSP
DSP converts real-world analog signals into a digital format. Through our nanoDSP™ technology, IntriCon offers an extensive range of ULP DSP amplifiers for hearing, medical and professional audio applications. Our proprietary nanoDSP incorporates advanced ultra-miniature hardware with sophisticated signal processing algorithms to produce devices that are smaller and more effective. The Company further expanded its DSP portfolio including improvements to its Reliant CLEAR™ feedback canceller, offering increased added stable gain and faster reaction time. Additionally, the DSP technologies are utilized in the Audion8™, our eight-channel hearing aid amplifier, and the Audion16™, our wide dynamic range compression sixteen-channel hearing aid amplifier. The amplifiers are feature-rich and are designed to fit a wide array of applications. In addition to multiple compression channels, the amplifiers have a complete set of proven adaptive features which greatly improve the user experience.
 
ULP Wireless 
Wireless connectivity is fast becoming a required technology, and wireless capabilities are especially critical in new body-worn devices. IntriCon’s BodyNet™ ULP technology, including the nanoLink™ and PhysioLink™ wireless systems, offers solutions for transmitting the body’s activities to caregivers and wireless audio links for professional communications and surveillance products, including diabetes monitoring and audio streaming for hearing devices.
 
IntriCon is in the final stages of commercializing its Physiolink3 wireless technology, which will be incorporated into product platforms serving the medical biotelemetry, hearing health, hearing health direct-to-end-consumer and professional audio communication markets. This system is based on 2.4GHz proprietary digital radio protocol in the industrial-scientific-medical (ISM) frequency band and enables audio and data streaming and command and control to ear-worn and body-worn applications over distances of up to ten meters. The Physiolink3 technology can be used to increase productivity in the emerging VBHH channels through in office wireless programming, remote cloud based fitting and consumer directed self-fitting of hearing aids. This will provide both greater access and lower costs for patients. In addition, remote control functions will improve the patient experience while using the device especially for those with diminished dexterity. The Physiolink3 technology builds on the Physiolink2 capabilities by adding wireless streaming at, what we believe, are much lower power levels than any technology currently on the market. This will allow for accessories to enhance the user experience in noisy environments by allowing audio streaming directly to the hearing aid.
 
Fitting Software 
 The ability to efficiently and effectively fit hearing aids is critical to building a value based eco-system of hearing healthcare. By developing more advanced fitting software systems, individuals can benefit from fittings that conform to their specific loss, while eliminating the need for an in-person appointment. In addition to the traditional fitting software, IntriFit, used in the conventional channel, IntriCon has made significant investments in various advanced fitting software solutions, including its purchase of the source code for the Sentibo Smart Brain self-fitting software, that can enable remote and self-fitting solutions. IntriCon believes these advanced fitting solutions, along with the other components of the eco-system, will drive access, affordability and superior customer satisfaction to the millions of individuals that cannot receive care today, primarily due to high cost and low access.

In January 2019, the Company purchased the source code for the Sentibo Smart Brain self-fitting software from Soundperience. The Sentibo Smart Brain System is the first psycho-acoustic way of analyzing peripheral hearing and central hearing processing. It was developed by an international research team based on the latest scientific findings from the fields of audiology and brain research. The software is a sophisticated self-fitting hearing aid and brain training software technology that is being used in the German market today, most notably through our Signison joint venture. We view this software technology as a critical component to our domestic value-based hearing healthcare model. Sentibo, as well as our other proprietary fitting systems, are designed to improve both channel productivity and the quality of first-time fittings, resulting in lower prices, greater access and increased customer satisfaction. IntriCon expects to introduce our advanced fitting solutions through our various VBHH channels in 2019.
 
Microminiaturization 
 IntriCon excels at miniaturizing body-worn devices. We began honing our microminiaturization skills over 30 years ago, supplying components to the hearing health industry. Our core miniaturization technology allows us to make devices for our markets that are one cubic inch and smaller. We also are specialists in devices that run on very low power, as evidenced by our ULP wireless and DSP. Less power means a smaller battery, which enables us to reduce size even further, and develop devices that fit into the palm of one’s hand.
Miniature Transducers 
 IntriCon’s advanced transducer technology has been pushing the limits of size and performance for over a decade. Included in our transducer line are our miniature medical coils and micro coils used in pacemaker programming and interventional catheter positioning applications. We believe that with the increase of greater interventional care, our coil technology harbors significant value.
Marketing and Competition:

IntriCon intends to focus more capital and resources in marketing and sales to expand its reach into the emerging value based hearing healthcare market and large medical device and healthcare companies in the medical biotelemetry market outlined above. The Company believes this will allow us to advance our technology portfolio, advance new product platforms, strengthen customer relationships and expand our market knowledge. 
 
Currently, IntriCon sells some of its hearing device products directly to domestic hearing instrument manufacturers, and distributors and partnerships through an internal sales force. As a result of the investments in Hearing Help Express in 2016 and 2017, the Company began marketing and selling hearing aid devices directly to consumers through direct mail advertising, internet and a call center. Sales of medical and professional audio communications products are also made primarily through an internal sales force. 
 
Internationally, sales representatives employed by IntriCon GmbH (“GmbH”), a wholly owned German subsidiary, solicit sales from European hearing instrument, medical device and professional audio communications manufacturers and suppliers. 
 
In recent years, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the Company’s sales. In 2018, one customer in our medical market accounted for approximately 56 percent of the Company’s net revenue. During 2018, the top five customers accounted for approximately $81,886, or 70 percent, of the Company’s net revenue. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of net revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area.
 
IntriCon markets its high performance microphone products to the radio communication and professional audio industries and has several larger competitors who have greater financial resources. IntriCon holds a small market share in the global market for microphone capsules and other related products.
 
Employees. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a total of 810 full time equivalent employees, of whom 74 are executive and administrative personnel, 53 are sales personnel, 41 are engineering personnel and 642 are operations personnel. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a union.
 
As a supplier of consumer and medical products and parts, IntriCon is subject to claims for personal injuries allegedly caused by its products. The Company maintains what it believes to be adequate insurance coverage.
 
Research and Development.  IntriCon conducts research and development activities primarily to improve its existing products and proprietary technology. The Company is committed to investing in the research and development of proprietary technologies, such as the ULP DSP and ULP wireless technologies. The Company believes the continued development of key proprietary technologies will be the catalyst for long-term revenues and margin growth. Research and development expenditures were $4,671, $4,458, and $4,688 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts are net of any customer and grant reimbursed research and development. 
 
IntriCon owns numerous United States patents which cover various product designs and processes. Although the Company believes that these patents collectively add value to the Company, the costs associated with the submission of patent applications are expensed as incurred given the uncertainty of the patents providing future economic benefit to the Company.

Regulation.  A large portion of our business operates in a marketplace subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies in foreign countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates the design control, development, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping, and surveillance procedures for medical devices.
 
United States Food and Drug Administration 
 FDA regulations classify medical devices based on perceived risk to public health as either Class I, II or III devices. Class I devices are subject to general controls, Class II devices are subject to special controls and Class III devices are subject to pre-market approval (“PMA”) requirements. While most Class I devices are exempt from pre-market submission, it is necessary for most Class II devices to be cleared by a 510(k) pre-market notification prior to marketing. A “cleared” 510(k) establishes that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device which was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 or which itself has been found to be substantially equivalent, through the 510(k) process, after May 28, 1976. It is “substantially equivalent” if it has the same intended use and the same technological characteristics as the predicate. The 510(k) pre-market notification must be supported by data establishing the claim of substantial equivalence to the satisfaction of the FDA. The process of obtaining a 510(k) clearance typically can take several months to a year or longer. If the product is notably new or different and substantial equivalence cannot be established, the FDA will require the manufacturer to submit a PMA application for a Class III device that must be reviewed and approved by the FDA prior to sale and marketing of the device in the United States. The process of obtaining PMA approval can be expensive, uncertain, lengthy and frequently requires anywhere from one to several years from the date of FDA submission, if approval is obtained at all.  A “De Novo” application may be submitted for a new type of Class II device for which there is no predicate.  The FDA controls the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and strictly prohibits the marketing of medical devices for unapproved uses. The FDA can require the manufacturer to withdraw products from the market for failure to comply with laws or the occurrence of safety risks. 
 
Our wireless and non-wireless hearing aids are air-conduction devices and, as such, are Class I and Class II medical devices. Air-conduction hearing aids are exempt from the 510(k) pre-market notification process. These hearing aids may be marketed either through distribution channels owned, in whole or in part, by IntriCon or through non-affiliated distribution channels.  In the latter sense, IntriCon acts as the contract manufacturer to the distributing organization, assisting in design, development and manufacturing. Our manufacturing operations are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, whose primary purpose is to audit the Company’s compliance with the Quality System Regulations published by the FDA (21 CFR Part 820) and other applicable government standards. Strict regulatory action may be initiated in response to audit deficiencies or to product performance problems. We believe that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the requirements of the FDA regulations. Our most recent FDA audits were conducted in December of 2017. No issues (observations) arising from those audits were noted. 
 
International Regulation
 International regulatory bodies have established varying regulations governing product standards, packaging and labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax. Many of these regulations are similar to those of the FDA. We believe we are in compliance with the regulatory requirements in the foreign countries in which our medical devices are marketed.
 
Medical device law in the EU requires that our quality system conforms to international quality standards and that our medical devices conform to “essential requirements” set forth by the Medical Device Directive (“MDD”). In order to keep pace with accelerating technical reality and manufacturing risks, medical device law in Europe is changing rapidly. Effective May 5, 2017, the MDD has been replaced with a broader, more reaching Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) with a three-year transition period. IntriCon intends to comply with the MDR prior to the end of the transition period. 
 
IntriCon manufacturing facilities are audited annually by an International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) registrar to verify conformity of products and quality systems to the relevant standards and regulations. The ISO registrar for our US facilities is British Standards Institute (“BSI”) while the registrar for our Asian facilities is SGS United Kingdom Ltd.   
 
Technical documentation, including the essential requirements matrix, for each product placed on the market in the EU is audited by our European Notified Body (also BSI).  Successful audits verify conformance to the essential requirements set forth by the MDD for the class of medical devices we produce and result in a CE Certificate.  This entitles us to place the “CE” mark on our devices distributed in Europe.  In 2014, IntriCon obtained “CE” certification for our own hearing aid devices and we are supplying these devices into the European market. Our hearing aids may also bear the CE mark of our customers who then assume regulatory responsibilities for those devices they place on the EU market under their own name.  
 
Our European Authorized Representative, CE Partner 4U, reviews and retains our technical documentation and registers our products as required with applicable authorities in all EU member states.
 
Third Party Reimbursement 
 The availability and level of reimbursement from third-party payers for procedures utilizing our products is significant to our business. Our products are purchased primarily by OEM customers who sell into clinics, hospitals and other end-users, who in turn bill various third party payers for the services provided to the patients. These payers, which include Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance plans and managed care organizations, reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures utilizing our products.

In response to the national focus on rising health care costs, numerous changes to reduce costs have been proposed or have begun to emerge. There have been, and may continue to be, proposals by legislators, regulators and third party payers to curb these costs. The development or increased use of more cost effective treatments for diseases could cause such payers to decrease or deny reimbursement for surgeries or devices to favor alternatives that do not utilize our products. A significant number of Americans enroll in some form of managed care plan. Higher managed care utilization typically drives down the payments for health care procedures, which in turn places pressure on medical supply prices. This causes hospitals to implement tighter vendor selection and certification processes, by reducing the number of vendors used, purchasing more products from fewer vendors and trading discounts on price for guaranteed higher volumes to vendors. Hospitals have also sought to control and reduce costs over the last decade by joining group purchasing organizations or purchasing alliances. OEM customers also seek to reduce their costs by attempting to reduce the prices they pay for our products. We cannot predict what continuing or future impact these practices, the existing or proposed legislation, or such third-party payer measures within a constantly changing healthcare landscape may have on our future business, financial condition or results of operations.
