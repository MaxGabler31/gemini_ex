DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
We aim to deliver our products and services as follows, to lease and sell to our customersÂ’ certain items or means of what we refer to as eco-transport. These items are commonly known under the names: a segway, a gyro-scooter or a self-balanced two-wheeled scooter, a self-balanced mono-wheeled scooter and a two-wheeled hoverboard. We expect our products and services to be demanded by establishments or enterprises or events, for instance, conferences held in large facilities, or touristic agencies and other establishments or organizations that face the problem of covering large distances by employees or visitors of theirs.
 
Our business address was provided by our registered agent and located at Mileve Maric Ajnstajn 72, Novi Beograd, Republic of Serbia 11070. Our telephone number is (315) 359-5955. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company and have generated $6,279 in revenue as for the year ended November 30, 2018. It is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and would be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding. 
 
Business
 
We are a company currently undergoing the stage of development. We plan to sell or lease means of ecological urban transportation to companies arranging events, such as exhibitions of any kind or conferences, where these means mentioned above can be used by the spectators to move around the facilities. We also expect medium sized production companies to lease our equipment for their employees to move around the warehouses or around the territory where it doesn't violate safety rules. Construction companies may lease or obtain our equipment to provide with it monitoring committees or authorities arriving with inspection, as well as superintendant workers. We expect that the use of ecological means of transportation may help employees of business entities or customers of event organizations to become more mobile, or to be able to cover larger distances in shorter terms of time. At an event occasion these items of transportation can also be used in additional advertising purposes to attract wider group of customers by being up-to-date or as advertising means, with promotional stickers being placed on them. At the same time, inspecting authorities may be able to complete their task of inspection in less amount of time, thus becoming more effective. We plan to offer our services to airports, where they will be able to lease those units to passengers who are in a rush to their terminals, the ones who want to avoid the fatigue after covering large distances between terminals, or the ones with troubles to walk. We also hope that hospitals may turn to us, as in some cases there are patients with restricted mobility who do not require a wheelchair but still face difficulties to walk. Those who did not suffer brain disorders and maintain their balance might use gyro transportation to move around the hospital territory or facilities. Amusement parks may acquire such means of transportation to lease them to their visitors. We expect our gyro vehicles to be demanded by the touristic companies that arrange city tours, thus creating an alternative to walking tours and bus tours. To make our interaction with customers more effective we plan to grant every customer a free training course on how to drive the gyro vehicles and maintain them, what issues may happen due to misuse and how to prevent them, as well as fix minor issues. As an additional service we might collect the sold items to be repaired and find the licensed repair shop on behalf of our customers, while providing a substitute unit instead.

Customers
 
We expect our potential customers to be business entities performing jobs at, or providing services at, or maintaining the services or premises of museums, exhibition centres, trade centres, shopping malls, entertainment centres, amusement parks, local parks, construction sites, hospitals or airports. We also may lease the gyro-transportation units to groups of individuals if they apply for it.
Marketing
 
Our steps are likely to be as follows:
 - organize free exhibitions and workshops for potential customers; 
 - take part in the exhibitions and workshops that our potential customers may have interest in;
 - to pay for the web banners on the websites where our potential customers might see our advertisement.
 - to release printed advertisement in magazines.
 - to order shooting of promotional videos from advertising agencies.
 - to pay for the SEO (search engine optimization), which helps us to take place in the top of search inquiries.
 - branding the gyro-vehicles to the needs of customers, by placing stickers or painting the colors to match the brand identity;
 During our marketing campaign we plan to highlight the ability to be more mobile and efficient and to demonstrate this we plan to invite guest stars to take part in our promotional videos.
Competition
 
We believe that narrowing to a very certain groups of customers, by which we mean small or medium business entities, can help us to target them more precisely. Understanding the needs of our customers will help us to avoid storing a huge amount of various transportation models, but only a few varieties. The same types of gyro vehicles can be shipped to museums, exhibition centres and airports, whereas a second different type will meet the needs of construction sites, warehouses and small factories. The third sort of vehicles will suit the needs of open space establishments like parks.
Revenue
 
We expect to have two main income streams: the money that we are likely to receive after:
 a) selling or 
 b) leasing the eco-transportation units.
 
Insurance
 
We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees.
 
We are a startup company and currently do not have employees other than, Milena Topolac Tomovic, our sole officer and director. We intend to hire employees on an as needed basis.
Offices
 
Our business address is at Mileve Maric Ajnstajn 72, Novi Beograd, Republic of Serbia 11070. This address was provided by our registered agent service. We do not pay any lease and there is no agreement to pay any lease in the future. Our telephone number is (315) 359-5955.
Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules, and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.
