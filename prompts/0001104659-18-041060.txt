ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Edward M. Knabusch and Edwin J. Shoemaker started Floral City Furniture in 1927, and in 1928 the newly formed company introduced its first recliner. In 1941, we were incorporated in the state of Michigan as La-Z-Boy Chair Company, and in 1996 we changed our name to La-Z-Boy Incorporated. Today, our La-Z-Boy brand is the most recognized brand in the furniture industry.
 
We manufacture, market, import, export, distribute and retail upholstery furniture products. In addition, we import, distribute and retail accessories and casegoods (wood) furniture products. We are the leading global

producer of reclining chairs and the second largest manufacturer/distributor of residential furniture in the United States. The La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores retail network is the third largest retailer of single-branded furniture in the United States. We have seven major manufacturing locations and six regional distribution centers in the United States and one facility in Mexico to support our speed-to-market and customization strategy. We operate a wholesale sales office that is responsible for distribution of our product in the United Kingdom and Ireland and we also participate in two joint ventures in Thailand that support our international businesses; one of which operates a manufacturing facility and the other operates a wholesale sales office. We operate a global trading company in Hong Kong which helps us manage our Asian supply chain by establishing and maintaining relationships with our Asian suppliers, as well as identifying efficiencies and savings opportunities. Additionally, we have contracts with several suppliers in Asia to produce products that support our pure import model for casegoods.
 
We sell our products to furniture retailers or distributors in the United States, Canada, and approximately 60 other countries, including the United Kingdom, China, Australia and New Zealand, directly to consumers through stores that we own and operate, and through our website, la-z-boy.com. The centerpiece of our retail distribution strategy is our network of 350 La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores and 535 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio® locations, each dedicated to marketing our La-Z-Boy branded products. We consider this dedicated space to be proprietary. We own 146 of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores. The remainder of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores, as well as all 535 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio® locations, are independently owned and operated. La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores help consumers furnish their homes by combining the style, comfort, and quality of La-Z-Boy furniture with our available design services. La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio® locations are defined spaces within larger independent retailers that are dedicated to displaying and selling La-Z-Boy branded products. In total, we have approximately 7.8 million square feet of proprietary floor space dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products in North America. Additionally, floor space outside of the United States and Canada dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products totals approximately 2.5 million square feet. Our other brands, England, American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid enjoy distribution through many of the same outlets, with approximately half of Hammarys sales originating through the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® store network. Kincaid and England have their own dedicated proprietary in-store programs with 542 outlets and approximately 1.7 million square feet of proprietary floor space. In total, our proprietary floor space includes approximately 12.0 million square feet worldwide.
 
Principal Products and Industry Segments
 
Our reportable operating segments are the Upholstery segment, the Casegoods segment and the Retail segment.
 
Upholstery Segment. Our Upholstery reportable segment is our largest business segment and consists primarily of two operating segments: La-Z-Boy, our largest operating segment, and the operating segment for our England subsidiary. The Upholstery segment also includes our international wholesale businesses. These operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment because they are economically similar and because they meet the other aggregation criteria for determining reportable segments. Our Upholstery segment manufactures and imports upholstered furniture such as recliners and motion furniture, sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, ottomans and sleeper sofas. The Upholstery segment sells directly to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores, operators of La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio® locations and England Custom Comfort Center locations, major dealers, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers.
 
Casegoods Segment. Our Casegoods segment consists of one operating segment, and sells furniture under three brands: American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid. Our Casegoods segment is an importer, marketer, and distributor of casegoods (wood) furniture such as bedroom sets, dining room sets, entertainment centers and occasional pieces, and also manufactures some coordinated upholstered furniture. The Casegoods segment sells directly to major dealers, as well as La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers.

Retail Segment. Our Retail segment consists of one operating segment, and includes our 146 company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores. The Retail segment primarily sells upholstered furniture, in addition to some casegoods and other accessories, to the end consumer through these stores.
 
We have provided additional detailed information regarding our segments and their products in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and our Managements Discussion and Analysis section, both of which are included in this report.
 
Raw Materials and Parts
 
The principal raw materials and parts used in our Upholstery segment are purchased cover (primarily fabrics and leather), polyester batting and polyurethane foam for cushioning and padding, lumber and plywood for frames, steel for motion mechanisms, electrical components for power units and various other metal components for fabrication of product. We purchase about 50% of our polyurethane foam from one supplier, which has several facilities across the United States that deliver to our plants. We purchase cover from a variety of sources, but we rely on a limited number of major suppliers. We purchase approximately half of our cover in a raw state (fabric rolls or leather hides) and cut and sew it into cover, and purchase the remainder in covers that have already been cut and sewn to our specifications by third-party offshore suppliers. We buy cut-and-sewn leather and fabric products from six primary suppliers. Of the products that we import, four suppliers that operate in China manufacture over 95% of the leather cut-and-sewn sets, and three suppliers that also operate in China manufacture over 90% of the fabric products. One of the six primary suppliers manufactures both leather cut-and-sewn sets and fabric products. We use these suppliers primarily for their product design capabilities, to leverage our buying power, and to control quality and product flow, in addition to their ability to handle the volume of product we require to operate our business. If any of these suppliers experienced financial or other difficulties, we could experience temporary disruptions in our manufacturing process until we obtained alternate suppliers.
 
We manage our Asian supply chain through our global trading company in Hong Kong, which works to identify efficiencies, savings opportunities, and manage the relationship with our Asian suppliers. During fiscal 2018, the prices of materials we use in our upholstery manufacturing process increased moderately compared with fiscal 2017. We expect to experience an increase in raw material costs in fiscal 2019 as well as increases in transportation costs. In an effort to offset these projected increases, we have increased our selling prices to our customers.
 
Finished Goods Imports
 
We import all of the casegoods (wood) furniture that we sell. In fiscal 2018, we purchased approximately 55% of this imported product from three suppliers. We use these suppliers primarily to leverage our buying power, to control quality and product flow, and because their capabilities align with our product design needs. In addition, these suppliers have the ability to handle the volume of product we require. If any of these suppliers experienced financial or other difficulties, we could experience disruptions in our product flow until we obtained alternate suppliers, which could be lengthy due to the longer lead time required for sourced wood furniture from Asian manufacturers.
 
We use an all-import model for our wood furniture primarily to remain competitive for these products. The prices we paid for these imported products, including associated transportation costs, increased slightly in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. We currently expect the product costs to increase more in fiscal 2019 than fiscal 2018. We have increased our selling prices to help offset the expected rise in product costs. Looking across our wholesale segments, imported finished goods represented 8% of our consolidated sales in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.

Seasonal Business
 
We believe that the demand for furniture generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions, including consumer confidence, housing market conditions and unemployment rates. The table below shows our highest and lowest sales quarters based on historical experience, including fiscal 2018, by segment:

Segment | Highest sales quarter | Lowest sales quarter 
-----------+-------------------------+-----------------------
Upholstery | 4th | 1st 
Casegoods | 4th | 1st or 3rd 
Retail | 3rd | 1st 

 
We schedule production to maintain consistent manufacturing activity throughout the year whenever possible. We typically shut down our domestic plants for one week each fiscal year to perform routine maintenance on our equipment.
 
Economic Cycle and Purchasing Cycle
 
Our sales are impacted by the overall growth of the furniture industry, which is primarily influenced by consumer discretionary spending and existing and new housing activity. In addition, consumer confidence, employment rates, and other factors could affect demand. Upholstered furniture has a shorter life cycle than casegoods furniture because upholstered furniture is typically more fashion and design-oriented, and is often purchased one or two pieces at a time. Casegoods products, in contrast, are longer-lived and frequently purchased in groupings or suites, resulting in a much larger cost to the consumer. As a result, casegoods sales are more sensitive to economic conditions, and upholstered furniture normally exhibits a less volatile sales pattern over an economic cycle.
Practices Regarding Working Capital Items
 
The following describes our significant practices regarding working capital items.
 
Inventory: For our Upholstery segment, we maintain raw materials and work-in-process inventory at our manufacturing locations. Finished goods inventory is maintained at our six regional distribution centers as well as our manufacturing locations. Our regional distribution centers allow us to streamline the warehousing and distribution processes for our La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® store network, including both company-owned stores and independently-owned stores. Our regional distribution centers also allow us to reduce the number of individual warehouses needed to supply our retail outlets and help us reduce inventory levels at our manufacturing and retail locations.
 
For our Casegoods segment, we import wood furniture from Asian vendors, resulting in long lead times on these products. To address these long lead times and meet our customers delivery requirements, we maintain higher levels of finished goods inventory in our domestic warehouses, as a percentage of sales, of our casegoods products than our upholstery products.
 
Our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores maintain finished goods inventory at the stores for display purposes.
 
Our inventory increased $9.7 million during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The majority of the inventory growth is being driven by higher finished goods in our Upholstery segment due to increasing our on-hand inventory to better service our customers as we move into fiscal 2019. We will continue to manage our inventory levels to ensure they are appropriate relative to our sales volume, while maintaining our focus on service to our customers.

Accounts Receivable: During fiscal 2018, our accounts receivable increased $3.2 million compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in accounts receivable was due to fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2018 being higher than those in the fourth quarter of the prior year. We monitor our customers accounts and limit our credit exposure to certain independent dealers and strive to decrease our days sales outstanding where possible. Our days sales outstanding is a measure of the time needed to collect outstanding accounts receivable once we have completed a sale. Our days sales outstanding decreased slightly during fiscal 2018.
Accounts Payable: During fiscal 2018, our accounts payable increased $11.1 million compared with fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to standardizing payment terms with our vendors, which resulted in many payment terms being extended. Additionally, a portion of the increase was for amounts due to vendors for the construction of our new Innovation Center located on our Dayton, Tennessee campus.
Customer Deposits: We collect a deposit on a portion of the total merchandise price at the time a customer order is placed in one of our company-owned Retail stores, and on la-z-boy.com. These customer deposits increased $4.7 million during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. This increase was attributable to a higher volume of orders placed in the last quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the prior fiscal year, which had not been delivered as of fiscal year end.
Customers
 
Our wholesale customers are furniture retailers. While primarily located throughout the United States and Canada, we also have customers located in various other countries, including the United Kingdom, China, Australia and New Zealand.  Sales in our Upholstery and Casegoods segments are almost entirely to furniture retailers, but we also sell directly to end consumers through our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores that make up our Retail segment and through our website, la-z-boy.com.
 
We have formal agreements with many furniture retailers for them to display and merchandise products from one or more of our operating units and sell them to consumers in dedicated retail space, either in stand-alone stores or dedicated proprietary galleries or studios within their stores. We consider this dedicated space to be proprietary. For our Upholstery and Casegoods segments, our fiscal 2018 customer mix based on sales was 57% proprietary, 16% major dealers such as Art Van Furniture, Nebraska Furniture Mart and Slumberland Furniture, and 27% other independent retailers.
 
The success of our product distribution model relies heavily on having retail floor space that is dedicated to displaying and marketing our products. The 350-store La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® network is central to this approach. In addition, we sell product through proprietary space within other retail furniture stores, primarily La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio® locations, England Custom Comfort Center locations, Kincaid Shoppes, and other international locations.
 
Maintaining, updating, and, when appropriate, expanding our proprietary distribution network is a key part of our overall sales and marketing strategy. We intend to not only increase the number of stores in the network but also to improve their quality, including upgrading old-format stores to our new concept design through remodels and relocations. At the end of fiscal 2018, less than five percent of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores in the network were in the old format. As we continue to maintain and update our current stores to improve the quality of the network, the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® store network plans to open, relocate or remodel 20 to 25 stores during fiscal 2019, all of which will feature the new concept store design.
 
We select independent dealers for our proprietary La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® store network based on factors such as their management and financial qualifications and the potential for distribution in specific geographical areas. This proprietary distribution benefits La-Z-Boy, our dealers and our consumers. It enables La-Z-Boy to concentrate our marketing with sales personnel dedicated to our entire product line, and only that line and approved accessories. It allows dealers that join this proprietary group to take advantage of best practices with which other proprietary dealers have succeeded, and we facilitate forums for these
 
7




dealers to share best practices. These La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores provide our consumers a full-service shopping experience with a large variety of products, knowledgeable sales associates, and design service consultants.
 
Orders and Backlog
 
We typically build upholstery units based on specific dealer orders, either for dealer stock or to fill consumers custom orders. We import casegoods product primarily to fill our internal orders, rather than customer or consumer orders, resulting in higher finished goods inventory on hand as a percentage of sales. Because the size of our backlog at a given time may not be indicative of our future sales, we do not rely entirely on backlogs to predict future sales.
 
Our Upholstery segment backlogs as of April 28, 2018, and April 29, 2017, were approximately $69.7 million and $54.3 million, respectively, and our Casegoods segment backlogs were approximately $7.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively. Our Upholstery segment backlog for fiscal 2018 increased compared with the prior year due to the timing of shipments near the end of the fiscal year relative to orders placed. Our Casegoods segment backlog for fiscal 2018 was higher than the prior year due to strong orders on a collection that was introduced at the end of fiscal 2017 and became available to consumers in the middle of fiscal 2018. Due to the high demand for this new collection, orders for the product outpaced our shipments.
 
Competitive Conditions
 
We are the second largest manufacturer/distributor of residential (living and family room, bedroom, and dining room) furniture in the United States, as measured by annual sales volume.
 
Alternative distribution channels have increasingly affected our retail markets. Furniture companies that operate primarily online, such as JoyBird and Article, or that have developed a product that can be shipped more easily than traditional upholstered furniture, have increased competition for our products. The increased ability of consumers to purchase furniture through various furniture manufacturers and retailers internet websites, including companies such as Amazon, QVC, and Wayfair, which operate with lower overhead costs than a brick-and-mortar retailer, has also increased competition in the industry. Companies such as Costco, Home Depot, IKEA, Sams Club, Target, Wal-Mart, and others, also offer products that compete with some of our product lines.
 
The home furnishings industry competes primarily on the basis of product styling and quality, customer service (product availability and delivery), price, and location. We compete primarily by emphasizing our brand and the value, comfort, quality, and styling of our products. In addition, we remain committed to innovation while striving to provide outstanding customer service, exceptional dealer support, and efficient on-time delivery. Maintaining, updating, and expanding our proprietary distribution system, including identifying desirable retail locations, is a key strategic initiative for us in striving to remain competitive. We compete in the mid-to-upper-mid price point, and a shift in consumer taste and trends to lower priced products could negatively affect our competitive position.
 
In the Upholstery segment, our largest competitors are Ashley, Bassett, Best Chair, Ethan Allen, Flexsteel, Klaussner, Kuka, Man Wah, Natuzzi, and Southern Motion.
 
In the Casegoods segment, our main competitors are Bassett, Bernhardt, Ethan Allen, Heritage Home Group, Hooker Furniture, and Lacquer Craft. The Casegoods segment faces additional market pressures from foreign manufacturers entering the United States market and increased direct purchases from foreign suppliers by large United States retailers.
The La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries® stores operate in the retail furniture industry in the United States and Canada, and different stores have different competitors based on their geographic locations. Competitors
 
8




include: Arhaus, Ashley, Bassett Furniture Direct, Bobs Discount Furniture, Crate and Barrel, Ethan Allen, Restoration Hardware, Havertys, Williams-Sonoma, several other regional competitors (for example Art Van Furniture, Raymour & Flanigan Furniture, and Slumberland Furniture), and family-owned independent furniture stores.
 
In addition to the larger competitors listed above, a substantial number of small and medium-sized companies operate within our business segments, all of which are highly competitive.
Research and Development Activities
 
We remain committed to innovation and the construction of our new state-of-the-art Innovation Center located in Dayton, Tennessee, will replace our existing structure and house a model shop, technology center, test lab, and three-dimensional printing lab. This new Innovation Center will help us continue to develop new products to meet our customers needs. We expect construction of the Innovation Center to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
 
We provide additional information regarding our research and development activities in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, which is included in Item 8 of this report.
 
Trademarks, Licenses and Patents
 
We own several trademarks, including the La-Z-Boy trademark, which is essential to the Upholstery and Retail segments of our business. To protect our trademarks, we have registered them in the United States and various other countries where our products are sold. These trademarks have a perpetual life, subject to renewal. We license the use of the La-Z-Boy trademark to our major international partners and dealers outside of North America. We also license the use of the La-Z-Boy trademark on contract office furniture, outdoor furniture, and non-furniture products, as these arrangements enhance our brand awareness, broaden the perceptions of La-Z-Boy, and create visibility of the La-Z-Boy brand in channels outside of the residential furniture industry. In addition, we license to our branded dealers the right to use our La-Z-Boy trademark in connection with the sale of our products and related services, on their signs, and in other ways, which we consider to be a key part of our marketing strategies. We provide more information about those dealers, under Customers.
 
We hold a number of patents that we actively enforce, but we believe that the loss of any single patent or group of patents would not significantly affect our business.
 
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 
Our manufacturing operations involve the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws, and we are involved in a small number of remediation actions and site investigations concerning these substances. Based on a review of all currently known facts and our experience with previous environmental matters, we currently do not believe it is probable that we will have any additional loss for environmental matters that would be material to our consolidated financial statements.
Employees
 
We employed approximately 9,000 full-time equivalent employees as of April 28, 2018, compared with 8,950 employees at the end of fiscal 2017. We employed approximately 7,400 in our Upholstery segment, 200 in our Casegoods segment, 1,100 in our Retail segment, and the remaining employees as corporate personnel. We employ the majority of our employees on a full-time basis except in our Retail segment, where many of our employees are part-time.

Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales
 
In fiscal 2018, our direct export sales, including sales in Canada, were approximately 12% of our total sales. We operate a wholesale sales office in the United Kingdom which sells and distributes furniture in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We are part of a manufacturing joint venture in Thailand which distributes furniture in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and other countries in Asia, including China. We sell and distribute furniture in Korea, Taiwan, Japan, India, Malaysia, and other Asian countries through a sales and marketing joint venture in Asia. In addition, our global trading company in Hong Kong continues to enhance our ability to source products and materials from our Asian suppliers, and provides quality assurance, procurement and logistics expertise. We operate a facility in Mexico which produces cut-and-sewn fabric sets for our domestic upholstery manufacturing facilities.
 
We provide information on sales in the United States, Canada, and other countries in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements, which is included in Item 8 of this report. Our net property, plant, and equipment value in the United States was $173.6 million and $161.6 million at the end of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Our net property, plant, and equipment value in foreign countries was $7.3 million and $7.5 million in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.
 
See Item 1A of this report for information about the risks related to our foreign operations.
