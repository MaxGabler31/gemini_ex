General Development of Business
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “AMC”), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres primarily located in the United States and Europe.
Our business was founded in Kansas City, Missouri in 1920. Holdings was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on June 6, 2007. We maintain our principal executive offices at One AMC Way, 11500 Ash Street, Leawood, Kansas 66211.
COVID-19 Impact, Company Response and Change in Business Strategy
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) to be a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and could continue to materially affect our operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition for an extended period of time.
On March 17, 2020, we temporarily suspended all theatre operations in our U.S. markets and International markets in compliance with local, state, and federal governmental restrictions and recommendations on social gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and as a precaution to help ensure the health and safety of our guests and theatre staff. We resumed limited operations in the International markets in early June 2020 and limited operations in the U.S. markets in late August 2020. A COVID-19 resurgence during the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted in additional local, state, and federal governmental restrictions and many previously reopened theatres in International markets temporarily suspended operations again. The U.S. local, state, and federal governmental restrictions and temporary International market operation suspensions remained in place for much of the first quarter of 2021, but the limited seat restrictions were substantially removed and the International market operations restored by the end of the second quarter of 2021.
The North American and International industry box offices have also been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to the suspension of theatre operations by AMC and other theatre exhibitors and the COVID-19 related suspension of new movie production, studios have postponed new film releases beyond 2021 or moved them to the home video market, streaming, or premium video on demand (“PVOD”) platforms.
As a result of the suspended operations and limited new film content in 2020, our revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were higher than the revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, but continued U.S. governmental restrictions, International market operation suspensions and limited new film content in 2021 resulted in significantly lower revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 vaccines became widely available during 2021 and the number of previously delayed major movie title releases increased significantly in the second half of 2021, which had a material positive impact on our industry. However, the COVID-19 Delta variant generated a new surge in cases in the third quarter of 2021 and the COVID-19 Omicron variant has been generating infections since late November 2021. Overall for 2021, the industry box office remained considerably lower than the 2019 pre COVID-19 levels. A more robust slate of major movie releases is expected during 2022, which has generated optimism that movie theatre attendance levels will continue to improve gradually as we experienced in 2021. However, box office performance in 2022 could be impacted by the ongoing impact of COVID-19 which could lead to a return to social distancing restrictions or theatre operation suspensions, which together with direct or simultaneous release of movie titles to the home video or streaming markets in lieu of theatre exhibition, could have a material adverse impact on theatre attendance levels and our business.

● | As of February 24, 2022, we were operating all of our 587 U.S. theatres. Some of our major markets in the U.S., such as Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle require proof of vaccination for guests to be able to attend. At the beginning of March 2022, we expect the proof of vaccination requirement will expire in Chicago and Seattle. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we experienced an overall attendance increase in the U.S. of approximately 35,544,000, or 737.4%, compared

to the same period a year ago, and a decline of approximately 21,955,000, or 35.2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As of February 24, 2022, we were operating all of our 351 International theatres, with certain countries having limited seating capacities during limited opening hours. Spain, Italy, and Germany require proof of vaccination, or in certain locations a negative test is required, for guests to be able to attend. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we experienced an overall attendance increase in our International theatres of approximately 16,046,000, or 490.4%, compared to the same period a year ago, and a decline of approximately 10,926,000, or 36.1%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.

 As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.6 billion. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adjusted certain elements of our business strategy and took significant steps to preserve cash. We are continuing to take significant measures to further strengthen our financial position and enhance our operations, by eliminating non-essential costs, including reductions to our variable costs and elements of our fixed cost structure, introducing new initiatives, and optimizing our theatrical footprint. 
Additionally, we enhanced liquidity through debt issuances, debt exchanges and equity sales. See Note 8—Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations, Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity, and Note 16—Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for further information.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations, satisfy our obligations, including cash outflows for increased rent and planned capital expenditures, and comply with minimum liquidity and financial covenant requirements under our debt covenants related to borrowings pursuant to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and Odeon Term Loan Facility for at least the next twelve months. In order to achieve net positive operating cash flows and long-term profitability, we believe we will need to continue to increase attendance levels significantly compared to 2021 and achieve levels in line with pre COVID-19 attendance. We believe the global re-opening of our theatres, the anticipated volume of titles available for theatrical release, and the anticipated broad appeal of many of those titles will result in increased attendance levels. We believe that the sequential increases in attendance experienced each quarter as 2021 progressed are positive signs of continued demand for the movie going experience. However, there remain significant risks that may negatively impact attendance, including a resurgence of COVID-19 related restrictions, potential movie-goer reluctance to attend theatres due to concerns about COVID-19 variant strains, movie studios release schedules and direct to streaming or other changing movie studio practices.
We entered the Ninth Amendment (as defined in Note 8—Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof) pursuant to which the requisite revolving lenders party thereto agreed to extend the fixed date for the termination of the suspension period for the financial covenant (the secured leverage ratio) applicable to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8—Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof) from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022, which was further extended by the Eleventh Amendment (as defined in Note 8—Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof) from March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023, as described, and on the terms and conditions specified, therein. We are currently subject to minimum liquidity requirements of approximately $144 million, of which $100 million is required under the conditions for the Extended Covenant Suspension Period ending March 31, 2023, as amended, under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, and £32.5 million (approximately $44 million) of which is required under the Odeon Term Loan Facility. Following the expiration of the Extended Covenant Suspension Period ending March 31, 2023, the Company will be subject to the financial covenant under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility as of the last day of each quarter on which the aggregate principal amount of revolving loans, and letters of credit (excluding letters of credit that are cash collateralized) in excess of $25 million, outstanding under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 35% of the principal amount of commitments under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility then in effect, beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2023. We currently expect we will be able to comply with this financial covenant, however, we do not anticipate the need to borrow under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility during the next twelve months. See Note 8—Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for further information. Our liquidity needs thereafter will depend, among other things, on the timing of movie releases and our ability to generate cash from operations.

Our cash expenditures for rent increased significantly in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2021 as previously deferred rent payments and landlord concessions started to become current obligations. We received rent concessions provided by the lessors that aided in mitigating the economic effects of COVID-19 during the pandemic. These concessions primarily consisted of rent abatements and the deferral of rent payments. As a result, deferred lease amounts were approximately $315.1 million as of December 31, 2021. See Note 3—Leases in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for a summary of the estimated future repayment terms for the deferred lease amounts due to COVID-19.
It is very difficult to estimate our liquidity requirements, future cash burn rates and future attendance levels. Depending on our assumptions regarding the timing and ability to achieve significantly increased levels of operating revenue, the estimates of amounts of required liquidity vary significantly. Similarly, it is very difficult to predict when theatre attendance levels will return to pre COVID-19 levels, which we expect will depend on the continued widespread availability and use of effective vaccines for the coronavirus, and eventual abatement of more virulent strains of the virus, related government mandates on social distancing and mask use, and the supply of movie titles for theatrical exhibition. While our current cash burn rates have improved, these levels are not sustainable. Further, we cannot accurately predict what future changes may occur to the supply or release date of movie titles available for theatrical exhibition once moviegoers are prepared to return in large numbers. Nor can we know with certainty the impact on consumer movie-going behavior of studios who release movies to theatrical exhibition and their streaming platforms on the same date (“day and date”), or the potential attendance impact of other studio decisions to accelerate in-home availability of their theatrical movies. Studio negotiations regarding evolving theatrical release models and film licensing terms are ongoing. There can be no assurance that the attendance levels and other assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements and future cash burn rates will be correct, and our ability to be predictive is uncertain due to the unknown magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in generating the additional liquidity necessary to meet our obligations beyond twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to maintain or renegotiate our minimum liquidity covenant requirements, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
Please see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Part II thereof for additional information. 
We realized $1.2 billion of cancellation of debt income (“CODI”) in connection with our 2020 debt restructuring. As a result, $1.2 billion of our federal net operating losses were eliminated due to tax attribute reduction to offset the CODI. The loss of these attributes may adversely affect our cash flows and therefore our ability to service our indebtedness.
Narrative Description of Business
We are the world’s largest theatrical exhibition company and an industry leader in innovation and operational excellence. Over the course of our 100+ year history, we have pioneered many of the theatrical exhibition industry’s most important innovations. We introduced Multiplex theatres in the 1960s and the North American stadium-seated Megaplex theatre format in the 1990s. Most recently, we continued to innovate and evolve the movie-going experience with the deployment of our theatre renovations featuring plush, powered recliner seating and the launch of our U.S. subscription loyalty tier, AMC Stubs® A-List. Our growth has been driven by a combination of organic growth through reinvestment in our existing assets and through the acquisition of some of the most significant companies in the theatrical exhibition industry.
Our business is operated in two Theatrical Exhibition reportable segments, U.S. markets and International markets. Prior to 2016, we primarily operated in the United States. Our international operations are largely a result of our acquisition of Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited (“Odeon”) in November of 2016 and Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB (“Nordic”) in March of 2017.


Today, AMC is the largest theatre operator in the world. As of December 31, 2021, we owned, leased or operated 946 theatres and 10,562 screens in 12 countries, including 593 theatres with a total of 7,755 screens in the United States and 353 theatres and 2,807 screens in European markets and Saudi Arabia. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 100% of our theatre operations in Latvia and divested of 49% of our interest in Lithuania and Estonia operations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold the remaining 51% equity interest in Estonia and Lithuania. As of December 31, 2021, we were the market leader in the United States and Europe including in Italy,

Spain, Sweden, Norway, and Finland; and a leading theatre operator in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal and Germany. We have operations in four of the world’s 10 largest economies, including four of the six largest European economies (the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Germany) as of December 31, 2021.


As of December 31, 2021, in the U.S. markets, we owned, leased or operated theatres in 43 states and the District of Columbia, with approximately 49% of the U.S. population living within 10 miles of one of our theatres. We have a diversified footprint with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles, which we believe gives our circuit a unique profile and offers us strategic and operational advantages while providing our studio partners with a large and diverse distribution channel. As of December 31, 2021, we operated some of the most productive theatres in the top markets in the United States and were the market leader in the top two markets: New York and Los Angeles. As of December 31, 2021, our top five markets, in each of which we held the #1 share position, are Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Atlanta and Philadelphia, according to data provided by Comscore.
As of December 31, 2021, in the International markets, we owned, leased or operated theatres in 10 European countries and in Saudi Arabia through Saudi Cinema Company, LLC, our joint venture with Saudi Entertainment Ventures. In all of these 11 countries, we operate productive assets in each of the country’s capitals. As of December 31, 2021, about a third of our international recliner renovations occurred in London, Berlin and Madrid; three of the largest Western European Capitals. Due to the population density in Europe as of December 31, 2019, prior to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic, each screen served on average twice the population of a U.S. screen in a less populated market.

Our theatrical exhibition revenues are generated primarily from box office admissions and theatre food and beverage sales. We offer consumers a broad range of entertainment alternatives including traditional film programming, private theatre rentals, independent and foreign films, performing arts, music and sports. We also offer food and beverage alternatives beyond traditional concession items, including made-to-order meals, customized coffee, healthy snacks, beer, wine, premium cocktails, and dine-in theatre options. The balance of our revenues are generated from ancillary sources, including on-screen advertising, fees earned from our customer loyalty program, rental of theatre auditoriums, income from gift card and exchange ticket sales, and online ticketing fees.
Our Strategy
We are committed to maintaining a leadership position in the exhibition industry by focusing on forward-thinking initiatives for the benefit of our guests. We do this through a combination of unique marketing outreach, seamless digital technology and innovative theatre amenities designed to 1) transform AMC into a world-class leader in customer engagement, 2) deliver the best in-person experience while at AMC theatres, 3) selectively adjust our footprint through expansion in certain markets and strategic closure of underperforming theatres, 4) pursue adjacent opportunities that extend the AMC brand, and 5) explore attractive acquisitions leveraging our existing capabilities and core competencies. Consistent with our history and culture of innovation, we believe our vision and relentless focus on these key elements, which apply strategic and marketing components to traditional theatrical exhibition, will drive our future success.
As discussed above, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business. We have taken and continue to take steps to adapt our business strategy in the short-term in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including adjusting our theatre operating hours in those markets where we are open to align screen availability and associated theatre operating costs with attendance levels for each theatre and implementing a comprehensive set of cleaning and operational protocols across our theatres, which are further discussed below. We have also taken and continue to take significant steps to preserve cash by eliminating non-essential costs. Our capital allocation strategy will be driven by the cash generation of our business and will be contingent on maintaining adequate liquidity as well as a required return threshold. 
In the U.S. markets, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and under advisement of current & former faculty of Harvard University’s School of Public Health as well as the Clorox Company, we developed a comprehensive set of cleaning and operational protocols branded “AMC Safe and Clean” which have been implemented at every one of our U.S. theatres. AMC Safe & Clean protocols include enhanced cleaning procedures that include extra time between showtimes to allow for a full, thorough cleaning and nightly disinfecting, use of high-tech high-efficiency particulate air vacuums, upgraded air filtration efforts including the use of minimum efficiency reporting value-13 filters wherever possible, hand sanitizing stations throughout the theatre and the availability to guests of disinfectant wipes. In the International markets, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a comprehensive set of cleaning and operational protocols branded “We Are Safer Cinema” which have been implemented across our European theatres. Protocols include enhanced cleaning procedures and hand sanitizing stations throughout the theatre. We strictly follow local guidelines in regard to guest and staff masking and vaccination policies.

1) | Transform AMC into a World-Class Leader in Customer Engagement
---+---------------------------------------------------------------

AMC engages movie-goers through advances in technology and marketing activities to strengthen the bonds with our current guests and create new connections with potential customers that drive both growth and loyalty. AMC serves our guests, end-to-end, from before they enter our theatres, through their enjoyment of a comprehensive spectrum of film content while at our theatres and then again after the movie when they’ve left the theatre and are deciding what film to see the next time they visit.
In our U.S. markets, we begin the process of engagement with AMC Stubs®, our customer loyalty program, which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members-only offerings and services. It features a paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere™ for a flat annual membership fee and a non-paid tier called AMC Stubs Insider™. Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC theatres. Rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations. 
AMC Stubs® A-List is our monthly subscription-based tier of our AMC Stubs® loyalty program. This program offers guests admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week, including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to already seen movies from $19.95 and $23.95 per month depending upon the geographic market. AMC Stubs®
10




A-List also includes premium offerings including IMAX®, Dolby Cinema™ at AMC, RealD, Prime and other proprietary PLF brands. AMC Stubs® A-List members can book tickets online in advance and select specific seats at AMC Theatres with reserved seating. Upon the temporary suspension of theatre operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all monthly A-List subscription charges were put on hold. As we reopened theatres, A-List members had the option to reactivate their subscription, which restarted the monthly charge for the program.


As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 25,300,000 member households enrolled in AMC Stubs® A-List, AMC Stubs Premiere™ and AMC Stubs Insider™ programs on a combined basis. Our AMC Stubs® members represented approximately 40% of AMC’s U.S. market attendance during the year ended December 31, 2021. Our large database of identified movie-goers also provides us with additional insight into our customers’ movie preferences. This enables us to have a larger, more personalized and targeted marketing effort. 
In our International markets, we currently have loyalty programs in the major territories in which we operate. The movie-goers can earn points for spending money at the theatre, and those points can be redeemed for tickets and concession items at a later date. We currently have more than 12,800,000 members in our various International loyalty programs. We continue to evaluate the Odeon loyalty programs to determine how best to reward our European movie-goers and heighten guest loyalty to drive additional attendance to Odeon theatres.
Our marketing efforts are not limited to our loyalty program. We continue to improve our customer connections through our website and mobile apps and expand our online and movie offerings. We upgraded our mobile applications across the U.S. circuit with the ability to order food and beverage offerings via our mobile applications while ordering tickets ahead of scheduled showtimes. Our mobile applications also include AMC Theatres On Demand, a service for members of the AMC Stubs® loyalty program that allows them to rent or buy movies. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, AMC’s robust online and mobile platforms in our U.S. markets offer customers the safety and convenience of enhanced social distancing by allowing them to purchase tickets and concession items online, avoid the ticket line, and limit other high-touch interactions with AMC employees and other guests. Online and mobile platforms are also available in our International markets.

In June 2021, the Company launched AMC Investor Connect (“AIC”), an innovative new communication initiative to engage directly with its sizable retail shareholder base and convert shareholders into AMC consumers. AIC allows AMC shareholders to self-identify through the AMC website and receive AMC special offers and important Company updates. As part of AIC, members must sign up for an AMC Stubs account and provide additional personalized data that allows AMC to more precisely engage with our investor consumers. As of February 24, 2022, there were 613,807 global self-identified AMC shareholder members of AIC, which is comprised of both registered and beneficial shareholders.
During September 2021, we launched a multi-media global advertising campaign to engage customers and raise awareness about movie theatres’ unique experiences and how important theatrical exhibition is to the cultural fabric of society the world over. The multi-media campaign is anchored by a television commercial starring Oscar Winner Nicole Kidman, was directed by two-time Academy Award nominee Jeff Cronenweth and Tim Cronenweth, and was written by Academy Award screenwriter nominee Billy Ray. The campaign reinforces the communal and multi-sensory experience that can only be found in a movie theatre and introduces our new axiom: “AMC Theatres. We Make Movies Better.” This messaging will also be used in nine European countries by Odeon Cinema Group.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, we partnered with Sony Pictures to become the first theatrical exhibition company to offer AMC Stubs members a limited number of exclusive Spider-Man: No Way Home non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) based on a ticket purchase and redemption of a Spider-Man ticket on the opening night of the film. Some 86,000 exclusive and limited edition NFTs offer guests a tradeable collectible commemorating the most successful film of 2021. This NFT is tradeable and in the future will offer discounts or other benefits to the then-current holders to generate future attendance. We will continue to implement innovative NFT offers to further engage and build loyalty with our guests.

2) | Deliver the best in-person experience while at AMC theatres
---+------------------------------------------------------------

In conjunction with our advances in technology and marketing initiatives, and consistent with our long-term growth strategy, we plan to continue investing in our theatres and enhancing the consumer experience to deliver the best in-person experience and take greater advantage of incremental revenue-generating opportunities, primarily through comfort and convenience innovations, imaginative food and beverage initiatives, and exciting premium large format (“PLF”) offerings. Our ability to implement our growth strategy, however, remains highly uncertain, as the full impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Comfort and Convenience Innovations. Recliner seating is the key feature of our theatre renovations. We believe that maximizing comfort and convenience for our customers will be increasingly necessary to maintain and improve our relevance. These renovations, in conjunction with capital contributions from our landlords, involve stripping theatres to their basic structure in order to replace finishes throughout, upgrading the sight and sound experience, installing modernized points of sale and, most importantly, replacing traditional theatre seats with plush, electric recliners that allow customers to deploy a leg rest and fully recline at the push of a button. As of December 31, 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the quality improvement in the customer experience could drive a 33% increase in attendance, on average, at these locations in their first-year post renovation. These increases will only continue post-COVID-19 pandemic if attendance returns to normalized pre COVID-19 levels. Upon reopening a remodeled theatre, we typically increase the ticket price to reflect the enhanced consumer experience. 
As of December 31, 2021, in our U.S. markets, we featured recliner seating in approximately 351 U.S. theatres, including Dine-in-Theatres, totaling approximately 3,395 screens and representing 43.8% of total U.S. screens. In our International markets, as of December 31, 2021, we had recliner seating in approximately 89 International theatres, totaling approximately 572 screens and representing 20.4% of total International screens. 
Open-source internet ticketing makes AMC’s entire universe of seats in the U.S. (approximately 1.1 million as of December 31, 2021), for all our show times, as available as possible, on as many websites and mobile applications as possible. Our tickets are currently on sale either directly or through mobile apps, at our own website and our mobile apps and other third-party ticketing vendors. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 67% of our tickets were purchased online in the U.S., with approximately 80% of total online tickets being purchased through AMC.
Traditional payment sources are evolving rapidly around the globe as the use of cryptocurrencies become more popular and convenient. In response, during the fourth quarter of 2021, we introduced the ability for consumers to pay for tickets, food and beverage items and associated gifts cards with cryptocurrencies in the U.S. markets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. The acceptance of cryptocurrency is designed to offer guests greater flexibility and convenience, which we believe will increase attendance. 
Imaginative Food and Beverage Initiatives. Our deployment initiatives also apply to food and beverage enhancements. We have expanded our menu of enhanced food and beverage products to include meals, healthy snacks, premium beers, wine and mixed drinks, and other gourmet products. Our long-term growth strategy calls for investment across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital-intensive food and beverage design improvements to the development of new dine-in theatre options. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily modified our food and beverage operations to include more simplified concession menus, cashless transactions technology, hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes, and condiment and drink refills available by request, all in an effort to reduce the number of touchpoints between guests and employees. We have also upgraded our Coca-Cola Freestyle beverage machines to include a mobile app allowing guests to dispense drinks without the need to utilize the machine’s touch screen and we have expanded the capabilities of our online and mobile apps to include the ability to pre-order food and beverages when advanced tickets are purchased. Guests are able to order food and beverage items when buying tickets in advance and have the items ready upon arrival and available at dedicated pick-up areas or delivered to seat at select theatres.
Our MacGuffins Bar and Lounges (“MacGuffins”) give us an opportunity to engage our legal age customers. As of December 31, 2021, we offer alcohol in approximately 349 AMC theatres in the U.S. markets and 243 theatres in our International markets and continue to explore expansion globally.
Exciting Premium Large Format Offerings. PLF auditoriums generate our highest customer satisfaction scores, and we believe the investment in premium formats increases the value of the movie-going experience for our guests, ultimately leading to additional ticket revenue. To that end, we are committed to investing in and expanding our

offerings of the best sight and sound experiences through a combination of our partnerships with IMAX® and Dolby Cinema™ and the further development of our own proprietary PLF offering, AMC Prime.

● | IMAX®. IMAX® is one of the world’s leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of December 31, 2021, AMC was the largest IMAX® exhibitor in the U.S., with 186 (3D enabled) IMAX® screens and a 57% market share. Each one of our IMAX® local installations is protected by geographic exclusivity, and as of December 31, 2021, our IMAX® screen count was 96% greater than our closest competitor. We also operate 35 IMAX® screens in Europe. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we expect to continue to expand our IMAX® relationship across the U.S. and Europe, further strengthening our position as the largest IMAX® exhibitor in the U.S. and a leading IMAX® exhibitor in the United Kingdom and Europe. 

● | Dolby Cinema™. Dolby Cinema™ offers a premium cinema offering for movie-goers that combines state-of-the-art image and sound technologies with inspired theatre design and comfort. Dolby Cinema™ at AMC includes Dolby Vision™ laser projection and object-oriented Dolby Atmos® audio technology, as well as AMC’s plush power reclining seats with seat transducers that vibrate with the action on screen. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of December 31, 2021, we operated 154 Dolby Cinema™ at AMC auditoriums in the U.S. In December 2018, we introduced the first United Kingdom Dolby Cinema Auditorium in our iconic Leicester Square theatre in the heart of London, ending 2021 with eight Dolby Cinema™ Auditoriums in the International markets. We expect to expand the deployment of our innovative Dolby Cinema™ auditoriums in both our U.S. and International markets as part of our long-term growth strategy.


● | In-house PLF Brands. We also offer our private label PLF experience at many of our locations, with superior sight and sound technology and enhanced seating as contrasted with our traditional auditoriums. These proprietary PLF auditoriums offer an enhanced theatrical experience for movie-goers beyond our current core theatres, at a lower price premium than IMAX® or Dolby Cinema™. Therefore, it may be especially relevant in smaller or more price-sensitive markets. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 56 screens under proprietary PLF brand names in the U.S. markets and 77 screens in the International markets. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following table provides detail with respect to digital delivery, 3D enabled projection, large screen formats, such as IMAX® and our proprietary Dolby Cinema™, other PLF screens, enhanced food and beverage offerings and our premium seating as deployed throughout our circuit on December 31, 2021:

3) | Expand and Strategically Close Underperforming Theatres
---+--------------------------------------------------------

Our long-term growth strategy includes the deployment of our strategic growth initiatives, opening new-build theatres and continued exploration of small acquisitions. By expanding our platform through disciplined new-build theatres and acquisitions, we are able to further deploy our proven strategic initiatives while further diversifying our consumer base, leading to greater appeal for more films. The additional scale achieved through new-build theatres and acquisitions also serves to benefit AMC through global procurement savings and increased overhead efficiencies. We believe that expansion offers us additional opportunities to introduce our proven guest-focused strategies to movie-goers and will generate meaningful benefits to guests, employees, studio partners and our shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired 11 theatres with 140 screens, reopened one theatre with eight screens and built and opened 10 new theatres with 82 screens to implement our strategy to install consumer experience upgrades. 
Our long-term strategy also includes strategically closing underperforming theatres. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we permanently closed 20 theatres with 166 screens for leased locations where we could not renegotiate an acceptable future rent term and also owned properties, where we are seeking to sell the real estate to monetize its value.

4) | Pursue Adjacent Opportunities that Extend the AMC Brand
---+--------------------------------------------------------

We believe there is considerable opportunity to extend and monetize the AMC brand outside of our movie theatre auditoriums. We plan to pursue opportunities that capitalize on our attractive customer base, our leading brand, our 100+ years of food and beverage expertise, and technology capabilities.
As part of that strategy, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced we would be expanding our food and beverage business beyond theatrical exhibition and enter the multi-billion dollar popcorn industry with the launch of AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn in the U.S. markets.

● | Beginning in 2022, we will sell freshly made AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn at select mall retail locations around the country. Kiosks, counters, and stores will feature real AMC movie theatre popcorn and other AMC movie theatre treats.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additionally, we also plan to make our AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn, freshly popped in nearby theatres, available through food delivery-to-home services. In this way, consumers will be able to enjoy a slice of the AMC experience when being entertained at home.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We will sell “To Go” packages at our theatres of freshly popped popcorn for takeout and/or pickup.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Also coming later in 2022, we plan to offer prepackaged and ready-to-pop microwaveable AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn, which will become available for purchase in supermarkets and convenience stores around the country.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn is an opportunity to diversify our business and to create a new food and beverage revenue stream for the Company.

5) | Explore Attractive Acquisitions Leveraging Our Existing Capabilities and Core Competencies
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of our plans to pursue value-enhancing initiatives that lead to diversification of our business, we will consider attractive and opportunistic acquisitions inside and outside the Exhibition industry that leverage AMC’s footprint and capabilities as well as the core competencies and experiences of AMC’s management team.
​
Our Competitive Strengths
​
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
Leading guest engagement through digital marketing and technology platforms. Through our AMC Stubs® loyalty program, we have developed a consumer database of some 25.3 million households, representing approximately 52 million individuals. Our digital marketing and technology platforms allow us to engage with these customers frequently, efficiently and on a very personalized level. We believe personalized data drives increased engagement, resulting in higher attendance.

Leading Market Share in Important, Affluent and Diverse Markets. As of December 31, 2021, across our three biggest metropolitan markets in the United States—New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, representing 19% of the country’s total box office—we held a 44% combined market share. We had theatres located in the top 25 U.S. markets, holding the #1 or #2 position in 19 of those 25 markets based on box office revenue. We are also the #1 theatre operator in Italy, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Spain; the #2 operator in the United Kingdom and Ireland; the #3 operator in Portugal; and the #4 operator in Germany as of December 31, 2021. We believe our strong presence in these top markets makes our theatres highly visible and therefore strategically more important to content providers, who rely on the large audiences and marketing momentum provided by major markets to drive opinion-making and deliver a movie’s overall box office results.
We also have a diversified footprint with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles. We have theatres in more densely populated major metropolitan markets, where there is also a scarcity of attractive retail real estate opportunities, as well as complementary suburban and rural markets. Guests from different demographic and geographic profiles have different tastes in movies, and we believe by broadening our geographic base, we can help mitigate the impact of film genre volatility on our box office revenues.

Well Located, Highly Productive Theatres. Our theatres are generally located in the top retail centers across the United States. We believe this provides for long-term visibility and higher productivity and is a key element in the success of our enhanced food and beverage and more comfort and convenience initiatives. Our location strategy, combined with our strong major market presence, enable us to deliver industry-leading theatre-level productivity. During the year ended December 31, 2021, eight of the 10 highest grossing theatres in the U.S. were AMC theatres, according to data provided by Comscore. During the same period, AMC’s U.S. markets average total revenues per theatre was approximately $3.2 million. This per unit productivity is important not only to content providers, but also to developers and landlords, for whom per location and per square foot sales numbers are critical measures.
AMC Classic theatres are located primarily in smaller, suburban and rural markets, which affects total revenues per theatre. However, in general, theatres located in smaller suburban and rural markets tend to have less competition and a lower cost structure.

In our International markets, many theatres are located in top retail centers in major metropolitan markets with high visibility. We believe that deploying our proven strategic initiatives in these markets will help drive attendance and greatly improve productivity. Other theatres are in larger and mid-sized cities and towns in affluent regions.
Deployment of unique pricing structures to enhance revenue. AMC has developed a dedicated pricing department and, as a result, we have deployed several different strategic pricing structures that have increased revenue and profitability. 
In June 2018, we launched AMC Stubs® A-List, a subscription pricing structure that offers members three movies a week, including premium formats, for a monthly fee ranging from $19.95 to $23.95 depending on geographical location. Around the same time, we launched “Discount Tuesday” which offers AMC Stubs® members a reduced price for movie attendance on Tuesdays. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the results showed an incremental increase in attendance and corresponding increase in admissions and food and beverage revenue. 
Sources of Revenue
Box Office Admissions and Film Content. Box office admissions are our largest source of revenue. We predominantly license theatrical films from distributors owned by major film production companies and from independent distributors on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Film exhibition costs are based on a share of admissions revenues and are accrued based on estimates of the final settlement pursuant to our film licenses. These licenses typically state that rental fees are based on the box office performance of each film, though in certain circumstances and less frequently, our rental fees are based on a mutually agreed settlement rate that is fixed. In some European territories, film rental fees are established on a weekly basis and some licenses use a per capita agreement instead of a revenue share, paying a flat amount per ticket. 
The North American and International industry box office have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, film distributors have postponed new film theatrical releases and/or shortened or disregarded the period of theatrical exclusivity (the “window”). Theatrical releases may continue to be postponed and windows shortened or disregarded while the box office suffers from COVID-19 impacts. As a result of the reduction in theatrical film releases, we have licensed and exhibited a larger number of previously released films that have lower film rental 

15




terms. We have made adjustments to theatre operating hours to align screen availability and associated theatre operating costs with attendance levels for each theatre.

As we continue our recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, our aggregate attendance levels remain significantly behind pre-pandemic levels. However, for the first time since 2019, substantially all of our worldwide theatres were open for the entirety of the third and fourth quarters of 2021. 


During the year ended December 31, 2021, films licensed from our six largest movie studio distributors based on revenues accounted for approximately 87% of our U.S. admissions revenues, which consisted of Sony, Disney, Universal, Warner Bros., Paramount, and Lionsgate. In Europe, approximately 77% of our box office revenue came from films attributed to our four largest movie distributor groups; which consisted of Universal, Disney, Sony, and Warner Bros. Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor’s films in any given year.
Food and Beverage. Food and beverage sales are our second largest source of revenue after box office admissions. We offer enhanced food and beverage products that include meals, healthy snacks, premium liquor, beer and wine options, and other gourmet products. Our long-term growth strategy calls for investment across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital-intensive food and beverage menu improvements to the expansion of our dine-in theatre brand. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have streamlined our concession menus to focus on our best-selling products and expanded cashless transactions technology through the deployment of mobile ordering across all brands, all in an effort to reduce the number of touchpoints between guests and employees. We have also upgraded our Coca-Cola Freestyle beverage software to allow guests to dispense drinks without the need to utilize the machine’s touch screen using the Coca-Cola Freestyle app.
We currently operate 51 Dine-In Theatres in the U.S. and three Dine-In Theatres in Europe that deliver chef-inspired menus with seat-side or delivery service to luxury recliners with tables. Our recent Dine-In Theatre concepts are designed to capitalize on the latest food service trend, the fast and casual eating experience.
Our MacGuffins Bar and Lounges (“MacGuffins”) give us an opportunity to engage our legal age customers. As of December 31, 2021, we offer alcohol in approximately 349 AMC theatres in the U.S. markets and 243 theatres in our International markets and continue to explore expansion globally.
Theatrical Exhibition Industry and Competition
U.S. markets. In the U.S., the movie exhibition business is large, stable, and mature. While in any given calendar quarter the quantity and quality of movies can drive volatile results, box office revenues have generally advanced from 2011 to 2019. The industry’s best year ever, in terms of revenues, was 2018, with box office revenues of approximately $11.9 billion, an increase of approximately 7.1% from 2017, with 1.3 billion admissions in the U.S. and Canada. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, local, state and federal governments issued stay-at-home orders and closure notices for certain businesses, including all theatres and studio production, for an extended portion of 2020. As a result, new film content production remained nearly non-existent, and a large portion of 2020 scheduled movies were released in the home on streaming platforms or moved into 2021. 
We believe it is the quality of the movie-going experience that will define future success. Whether through enhanced food and beverage options (Food and Beverage Kiosks, Marketplaces, Coca-Cola Freestyle, MacGuffins or Dine-in Theatres), more comfort and convenience (recliner seating, open-source internet ticketing, reserved seating), engagement and loyalty (AMC Stubs®, mobile apps, social media) or sight and sound (digital projectors, 3D, Dolby Cinema™ at AMC, other PLF screens or IMAX®), it is the ease of use and the amenities that these innovations bring to customers that we believe will drive sustained profitability in the years ahead.

 * Number of theatres and indoor screens information was not available for calendar year 2021 as of the date of this filing.
Based on information obtained from Comscore, we believe that the three largest exhibitors, in terms of U.S./Canada box office revenue (AMC, Regal Entertainment Group, and Cinemark Holdings, Inc.) generated approximately 54% of the box office revenues in 2021. 


International markets. Movie-going is a popular leisure activity with high penetration across key geographies in our International markets. Theatre appeal has proven resilient to competition for consumers’ leisure spending and to recessionary periods and we believe we will continue to benefit from increased spending across International markets. The European market lags the U.S. market across a number of factors, including annual spend per customer, number of IMAX® screens and screens per capita that cause us to believe that the deployment of our customer initiatives will be successful in these markets. On the other hand, our European markets are more densely populated and operate with fewer screens per one million of population, making the screens we acquired more valuable.

Additionally, U.S. films generate the majority of the box office in Europe, but movie-goers in specific geographies welcome locally produced films with local actors and familiar story lines which can mitigate film genre attendance fluctuations. Going forward, we believe we will see positive growth in theatre attendance as we continue to deploy our proven guest-centered innovations like recliner seating, enhanced food and beverage offerings, and premium large format experiences. Like the U.S., the international industry box office suffered from months of theatre closures, significantly fewer new films and reopening restrictions and generated far fewer sales than 2019.

The following table provides information about the exhibition industry attendance for the International markets where we operate obtained from territory industry trade sources, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 thereof for information regarding our operating data:

​
Competition. Our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which they operate. Competition is often intense with respect to attracting patrons, licensing motion pictures and finding new theatre sites. Where real estate is readily available, it is easier to open a theatre near one of our theatres, which may adversely 

17




affect operations at our theatre. However, in certain of our densely populated major metropolitan markets, we believe a scarcity of attractive retail real estate opportunities enhances the strategic value of our existing theatres. We also believe the complexity inherent in operating in these major metropolitan markets is a deterrent to other less sophisticated competitors, protecting our market share position.
The theatrical exhibition industry faces competition from other forms of out-of-home entertainment, such as concerts, amusement parks and sporting events, and from other distribution channels for filmed entertainment, such as cable television, pay-per-view, video streaming services, PVOD, and home video systems, as well as from all other forms of entertainment.
We believe movie-going is a compelling consumer out-of-home entertainment experience. Movie theatres currently garner a relatively small share of overall consumer entertainment time and spend, and our industry benefits from available capacity to satisfy additional consumer demand without capital investment.
Seasonality
Our revenues are dependent upon the timing of motion picture releases by distributors. The most marketable motion pictures are usually released during the summer and the year-end holiday seasons. Therefore, our business is seasonal, with higher attendance and revenues generally occurring during the summer months and holiday seasons. During the COVID-19 pandemic, and in following periods, our business and results of operations have not and may continue to not experience our historically typical patterns of seasonality.
Regulatory Environment
The distribution of motion pictures is subject to regulation under federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases. Consent decrees, resulting from one of those cases to which we were not a party, have had a material impact on the industry and us. Those consent decrees bound certain major motion picture distributors and limited how motion pictures could be distributed. The U.S. Department of Justice recently terminated the consent decrees, subject to a two-year sunset period for certain prohibitions, including block booking and circuit dealing. At this time, we cannot project what impact, if any, termination of the consent decrees may have on industry licensing practices.
Our theatres in the United States must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA. Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations, including websites and mobile apps for such accommodations, be accessible to individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations are made to conform to accessibility guidelines. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, and awards of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. As an employer covered by the ADA, we must make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of employees and qualified applicants with disabilities, provided that such reasonable accommodations do not pose an undue hardship on the operation of our business. In addition, many of our employees are covered by various government employment regulations, including minimum wage, overtime and working conditions regulations. In Europe, all territories have similar national regulations relating to disabilities.
Our operations also are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating such matters as construction, renovation and operation of theatres as well as wages and working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements, consumer and employee privacy rights, and licensing, including alcoholic beverage sales. We believe our theatres are in material compliance with such requirements.
We own and operate theatres and other properties in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Saudi Arabia, which are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. Certain of these laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental protection, may impose joint and several liability on certain statutory classes of persons for the costs of investigation or remediation of contamination, regardless of fault or the legality of original disposal. We believe our theatres are in material compliance with such requirements.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our theatres have been subject to various governmental orders requiring us to take or refrain from certain activities including, but not limited to, suspending operations, reduction in seating capacities, enforcement of social distancing, establishment of enhanced cleaning protocols, restrictions on food and beverage sales, tracking the identity of guests, employee protection protocols, and limitation on operating hours. Although the orders 

18




have been modified frequently, we believe our theatres have maintained material compliance with such orders. We currently cannot predict when or if COVID-19 related governmental orders will be fully terminated and whether similar orders will be utilized more frequently during future public health outbreaks. 
AMC Human Capital Resources
​
Our People. AMC associates are core to our commitment to delivering the best theatrical experience in the world. They uphold AMC’s mission of focusing on the guest experience in our theatres, an experience in which excellent customer service is complemented with amazing food and beverage, comfort and premium sight and sound.
COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts. The pandemic has had enormous impacts on our industry, guests and associates and has resulted in material variances in our associate metrics in calendar 2021 compared to the 2019 pre COVID-19 years. As of December 31, 2021, we employed a total of approximately 31,198 employees, including part-time employees, consisting of approximately 3,046 full-time and approximately 28,152 part-time employees, up from an aggregate of approximately 25,019 employees, including part-time and furloughed employees, consisting of approximately 3,449 full-time and approximately 21,570 part-time employees as of December 31, 2020, and down from an aggregate of approximately 38,872 employees consisting of approximately 3,952 full-time and approximately 34,920 part-time employees as of December 31, 2019. 
Despite the challenges presented by the pandemic, our associates have been instrumental in delivering AMC’s Safe & Clean program, which launched upon the reopening of our theatres in the fall of 2020. Safe & Clean is a set of cleaning protocols and measures that we have implemented to protect the health and safety of our guests and associates. Our new policies and procedures are advised by faculty members at Harvard School of Public Health and have been developed with the Clorox Company. 
Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention. Critical to our operations is the hiring, developing and retaining of employees who support our guest-focused mission in our theatres. Acquiring the right talent at speed and scale is a core capability that we regularly monitor and manage, given the need to rapidly staff our frontline operations. Once hired, we focus on the development of our associates, creating experiences and programs that promote performance, growth and career opportunities for those who are life-long passionate about our business. We sponsor numerous training, education and leadership development programs for associates at all levels, from hourly associates to executive officers. These programs are designed to enhance leadership and managerial capability, ensure quality execution of our programs, drive client satisfaction and increase return on investment. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Our goal is to create a workforce as diverse as the guests we serve and the movies we show on our screens. As such, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) are fundamental to our culture and critical to our success. In support of this goal, AMC established four councils in support of Women, Latinx, African American and LGBTQ+ associates. The purpose of these councils is to strengthen AMC’s culture by defining opportunities to embrace our diversity, lead with fairness and impartiality and create a more inclusive work environment by leveraging associate experiences. These councils are supported by the DEI function under the guidance of the Chief Human Resources Officer. This DEI focus ensures that all communities are represented in our long-term systemic approach. Our work has been recognized externally: AMC has received a perfect score for 14 consecutive years on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index as one of the “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality”; and for seven years running has been named one of the “Best Places to Work” for people with disabilities on the Disability Equality Index. 
Compensation, Benefits, Safety and Wellness. In addition to offering market competitive salaries and wages, we offer comprehensive health and retirement benefits to eligible employees. Our health and welfare benefits are supplemented with specific programs to manage or improve common health conditions, a variety of voluntary benefits and paid time away from work programs. We also provide a number of innovative programs designed to promote physical, emotional and financial well-being. Our commitment to the safety and health of our associates continues to be a top priority.
