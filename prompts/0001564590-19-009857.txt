Item 1. Business
General
 Iconix Brand Group is a brand management company and owner of a diversified portfolio of approximately 30 global consumer brands across the women’s, men’s, home and international segments. The Company’s business strategy is to maximize the value of its brands primarily through strategic licenses and joint venture partnerships around the world, as well as to grow the portfolio of brands through strategic acquisitions.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s brand portfolio includes Candie’s ®, Bongo ®, Joe Boxer ® , Rampage  ® , Mudd  ®  , London Fog  ®  , Mossimo  ®  , Ocean Pacific/OP  ®  , Danskin/Danskin Now ®  , Rocawear  ®  /Roc Nation  ®  , Cannon  ®  , Royal Velvet  ®  , Fieldcrest  ®  , Charisma  ®  , Starter  ®  , Waverly  ®  , Ecko Unltd  ®  /Mark Ecko Cut & Sew  ®  , Zoo York  ®  , Umbro ®, Lee Cooper  ® , and Artful Dodger  ®; and interests in Material Girl  ®  , Ed Hardy  ®  , Truth or Dare  ®  , Modern Amusement  ®  , Buffalo ®  , Hydraulic  ®, and PONY ®.
 The Company seeks to monetize the Intellectual Property (herein referred to as “IP”) related to its brands throughout the world and in all relevant categories primarily by licensing directly with leading retailers (herein referred to as “direct to retail” or “DTR”), through consortia of wholesale licensees, through joint ventures in specific territories and via other activity such as corporate sponsorships and content as well as the sale of IP for specific categories or territories. Products bearing the Company’s brands are sold across a variety of distribution channels. The licensees are generally responsible for designing, manufacturing and distributing the licensed products. The Company supports its brands with marketing, advertising and promotional campaigns designed to increase brand awareness. Additionally, the Company provides its licensees with coordinated trend direction to enhance product appeal and help build and maintain brand integrity.  
 Globally, the Company has over 50 direct-to-retail licenses and more than 375 total licenses. Licensees are selected based upon the Company’s belief that such licensees will be able to produce and sell quality products in the categories and distribution channels of their specific expertise and that they are capable of exceeding minimum sales targets and royalties that the Company generally requires for each brand. This licensing strategy is designed to permit the Company to operate its licensing business, leverage its core competencies of marketing and brand management with minimal working capital. The vast majority of the Company’s licensing agreements include minimum guaranteed royalty revenue which provides the Company with greater visibility into future cash flows. As of January 1, 2019, the Company had over $405 million of aggregate guaranteed royalty revenue over the terms of its existing contracts excluding renewals.
 A key initiative in the Company’s global brand expansion plans has been the formation of international joint ventures. The strategy in forming international joint ventures is to partner with best-in-class, local partners to bring the Company’s brands to market more quickly and efficiently, generating greater short- and long-term value from its IP, than the Company believes is possible if it were to build-out wholly-owned operations ourselves across a multitude of regional or local offices. Since September 2008, the Company has established the following international joint ventures: Iconix China, Iconix Latin America, Iconix Europe, Iconix India, Iconix Canada, Iconix Australia, Iconix Southeast Asia, Iconix Israel, Iconix Middle East, Umbro China, Danskin China, Starter China, and Lee Cooper China.  Note that the Company now maintains a 100% ownership interest in Iconix China, Iconix Latin America and Iconix Canada.  Refer to Note 5 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. 
 The Company’s primary goal of maximizing the value of its IP also includes, in certain instances, the sale to third parties of a brand’s trademark in specific territories or categories. As such, the Company evaluates potential offers to acquire some or all of a brand’s IP by comparing whether the offer is more valuable than the Company’s estimate of the current and potential revenue streams to be earned via the Company’s traditional licensing model. Further, as part of the Company’s evaluation process it also considers whether or not the buyer’s future development of the brand may help to expand the brand’s overall recognition and global revenue potential.

 Candie’s. Candie’s is known as a “fun & flirty” young contemporary lifestyle brand, featuring products in apparel, accessories and footwear categories. As Iconix’s longest held trademark, Candie’s brand was established in 1977 which started with a high-heeled wooden-sole slide shoe that allowed women to put a punctuation mark on their look. Since then, the Candie’s brand has popped with cultural connection reflecting the attitude and aspiration of the times. In July 2005, Kohl’s Department Stores, Inc., became the primary direct-to-retail licensee and launched an all-store roll out of the brand in the United States with a multi-category line of Candie’s products, including sportswear, denim, footwear, handbags and intimate apparel. Additionally, the brand has signed wholesale license agreements with channels outside of Kohl’s within optical, home, and girl’s underwear and sleepwear categories of business. Candie’s award-winning advertising is known for its flirty but playful concepts. Over the years the brand has created omni-channel marketing campaigns leveraging its talent of “It” girls including Britney Spears, Fergie, Destiny’s Child, Lea Michele, Vanessa Hudgens, Hilary Duff, Bella Thorne, Kelly Clarkson & Jenny McCarthy.

Danskin is a 135 year-old iconic brand of women’s activewear, athleisure, legwear, dancewear, intimates, sleepwear, and fitness equipment, which the Company acquired in March 2007.

The Danskin brand continues to be sold through better department, mid-tier, specialty and sporting goods stores, as well as through Danskin.com by wholesale licensees in the United States. In 2014, the brand re-launched its e-commerce site, blog, and expanded its social media efforts sustaining its heritage with dance.   As previously disclosed, the Company was notified that Wal-mart will not renew the existing Danskin Now license agreement for the brand subsequent to its expiration in January 2019.  The Danskin brand has 5 licensees including a new addition of Footwear for 2019.  Even after the termination of the Wal-mart retail license agreement, we believe the brand has a solid distribution of retailers.  These retailers include Amazon, Costco, Walmart.com as well as a strong presence within TJX corporation.  The Danskin brand has recently secured collaborations such as Footlocker/6:02 with the Jenna Dewan Collection.

The license agreement with Target expired on October 31, 2018.  We are in the process of developing a “go forward” strategy to position the brand in midrange retailers, off price retailers and on-line retailers in an effort to transfer the name of the brand developed over the years with the consumer.  Our 2019 focus is to secure strong licensee partners to design, develop and distribute a variety of product categories to a wider base of retailers that we believe will generate revenue to the Company beginning in 2020.

In the initial phase of the joint venture, Iconix China sought to maximize brand monetization through investment, whereby Iconix China received a minority equity stake in local operating companies in exchange for the rights to one or more of the Company’s brands in Greater China and brand management support. Pursuant to the terms of this transaction, the Company contributed to Iconix China substantially all rights to its brands in Greater China and contributed $2.0 million, and Novel contributed $17 million to Iconix China.  
 Iconix China successfully placed several brands into joint ventures including Candie’s and Marc Ecko Cut & Sew with Shanghai La Chapelle Fashion Co. Ltd (HK 6116); London Fog with China Outfitters (HK1146); Material Girl with Ningbo Peacebird; Ed Hardy with Landmark International; and Ecko Unltd. with Xi Ha Clothing.

Subsequently, the Company has secured traditional licensing agreements for many of its brands including Umbro, Joe Boxer, Rocawear, Rampage, Danskin and Starter.

International Joint Ventures
 The formation and administration of international joint ventures have been a central and ongoing component of our business since 2008. The Company established and maintains the following international joint ventures: Iconix Europe, Iconix India, Iconix Australia, Iconix Southeast Asia, Iconix Israel, Iconix Middle East, Umbro China and Danskin China. The Company’s primary purpose in forming international joint ventures has been to bring its brands to market more quickly and efficiently, generating greater short- and long-term value from its IP.  This approach enabled its brands to more rapidly increase licensing revenue, market share and profitability than what the Company believes it could have achieved on its own.

To get what we believe are best-in-class local partners to invest in and represent the Company’s brands in their respective territories, the Company offers its partner the ability to buy equity interests in the IP. These equity interests provide the Company’s partners with the necessary incentive to devote management time and resources to the brands. By leveraging the partners’ local market expertise, retail relationships, wholesale networks, business contacts and staff, the Company has significantly grown licensing royalties in key global markets, and maintained stricter enforcement against counterfeit products. As these businesses in each territory reach sufficient scale to support the Company’s full business structure of brand management, marketing, licensing, acquisitions and finance, the Company may consider acquiring control or full ownership of the joint ventures, where possible, as was the case in Latin America in 2014, in China in 2015 and Canada in 2017.
 Iconix Europe.  In December 2009, the Company contributed substantially all rights to its wholly-owned brands in all member states and candidate states of the European Union, and certain other European countries, to Iconix Europe, a then newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

Also, as part of this transaction, Iconix Europe entered into a multi-year brand management and services agreement with The Licensing Company to assist in developing, exploiting, marketing and licensing the contributed brands in the European territory.

Licensing Strategy
 The Company’s principal business strategy is to maximize the value of its brands by entering into strategic license agreements with best-in-class licensees that are responsible for designing, manufacturing and distributing the licensed products. Through our licensing business model, we have substantially eliminated inventory risk and reduced the operating exposure associated with traditional fully vertically integrated businesses, thereby resulting in attractive cash flows and operating margins. 
 The Company has over 375 licenses and has benefited from the model’s scalability, which enables the Company to leverage its existing infrastructure to support new business and brands. A key objective of the Company is to capitalize on its brand management expertise and relationships to build and maintain a diversified portfolio of consumer brands that generate increasing revenues. Through our international partnerships, we have successfully built a vast network of licensees around the world that are growing our brands outside of the United States. The Company is also committed to continuously reinvesting in its global platform in order to provide licensees with preeminent brand management knowledge and services to allow all partners to benefit from being a part of the Iconix network.
 The Company licenses its brands across a broad range of product categories, including fashion apparel, footwear, accessories, sportswear, home furnishings and décor, and beauty and fragrance. The Company seeks licensees with the ability to produce and sell quality products in their licensed categories and to meet and exceed minimum sales and royalty payment thresholds. 
 The Company maintains direct-to-retail and traditional wholesale licenses. Typically, in a direct-to-retail license, the Company grants exclusive rights to one of its brands to a single national retailer for a broad range of product categories. For example, the Fieldcrest brand is primarily licensed exclusively to Target in the United States across a variety of product categories. Direct-to-retail licenses provide retailers with proprietary rights to national brands at favorable economics. In a traditional wholesale license, the Company grants the right to a specific brand to a single or small group of related product categories to a wholesale supplier, who is permitted to sell licensed products to multiple stores within an approved distribution channel. For example, the Company licenses the Umbro brand in the United States to numerous wholesale suppliers for products ranging from athletic wear to footwear to apparel, for sale and distribution primarily to department and specialty stores.
 12


The Company’s licenses typically require the licensee to pay the Company royalties based upon net sales with guaranteed minimum royalties in the event that net sales do not reach certain specified targets. The Company’s licenses also typically require the licensees to pay to the Company certain minimum amounts for the advertising and marketing of the respective licensed brands. As of January 1, 2019, the Company and its joint ventures had a contractual right to receive over $405 million of aggregate minimum licensing revenue through the balance of all of their current licenses, excluding any renewals.
 The Company believes that coordination of brand presentation across product categories is critical to maintaining the strength and integrity of its brands. Accordingly, the Company typically maintains the right in its licenses to preview and approve all products, packaging and other presentations of the licensed mark. Moreover, in many of its licenses, prior to each season, representatives of the Company supply licensees with trend guidance as to the “look and feel” of the current trends for the season, including colors, fabrics, silhouettes and an overall style sensibility, and then work with licensees to coordinate the licensed products across the categories to maintain the cohesiveness of the brand’s overall presentation in the market place. Thereafter, the Company obtains and approves (or objects and requires modification to) product and packaging provided by each licensee on an on-going basis.  In addition, the Company communicates with its licensees throughout the year to obtain and review reporting of sales and calculation and payment of royalties.
 Marketing
 The Company believes marketing is a critical element in maximizing brand value to its consumers, licensees and to the Company. The Company’s in-house marketing department conceives and produces omni-channel marketing initiatives for the Company’s brands. These initiatives aim to increase brand awareness, positive perception and drive-engagement and conversion. The Company believes that its national campaigns result in increased sales and consumer recognition of its brands. 
 The Company has organized its marketing structure to allow for ongoing updates to its marketing campaigns based upon market trends. Marketing consists of four areas: Social and digital marketing, public relations, creative content generation and brand management. The Company uses its in-house talent to create compelling 360° marketing campaigns that include social/digital marketing, print, outdoor, celebrity, influencers, bloggers and other innovative strategies. It also will utilize outside agencies when needed to supplement. In addition to building omni-channel campaigns, the Company works with major retail partners to provide assets for online, digital/ social and in-store marketing.
 The Company maintains separate websites for each of its brands, in addition to www.iconixbrand.com to further market the brands. In addition, the Company has established an intranet for approved vendors and service providers who can access additional materials and download them through a secure network. 
 Many of the Company’s license agreements require the payment of an advertising royalty by the licensee, and in certain cases, the Company’s licensees are required to supplement the marketing of the Company’s brands by performing additional advertising through trade, cooperative or other sources.
 Trend direction
 The Company’s in-house brand management supports the brands by providing licensees with unified trend direction, guidance and coordination of the brand image across all product categories. The fashion team is focused on identifying and interpreting the most current trends, both domestically and internationally, by helping forecast the future design and product demands of the respective brands’ customers. Typically, the Company develops a trend guide, including color, print, pattern, fabrication and key silhouettes while being sensitive to the overall “DNA” of each brand. In addition, the Home division generates original designs and patterns, which both the licensees and DTR partners utilize to allow each brand their own brand identity and individual lifestyle.
 This is accomplished by delivering these guides each season. The fashion team also provides insight into new emerging categories and business shifts that affect the merchandising of the brand. Often times, these new ideas can be formulated and sold as capsule collections or sub-brands into current or new retailers, based on the guidance given by the fashion and brand management team. In addition, the Company has product approval rights in most licenses and further controls the look and mix of products its licensees produce through that process. In cases where we do not hold contractual approval rights, as is the case with many direct-to-retail licensees, the brand management and fashion teams still work closely with the designers and merchants of the particular retailer to give guidance and opinions on the product aesthetic.
 The team often provides bought samples from comparison shopping that inspire key items within each collection. With respect to Alberta ULC (owner of the Buffalo brand), the Company has entered into arrangements with its partner to oversee and control the creative aspects of the brand, including design and brand marketing. With respect to our Umbro brand, we have created a design entity, Diamond Icon, that designs apparel and footwear products to service the needs of our global licensee network.

Kmart/Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2018 and subsequently rejected the existing license agreements for Joe Boxer, Cannon and Bongo.  We are currently working with Kmart/Sears as to whether they will utilize these brands in future periods.  
 Competition
 The Company’s proprietary brands are all subject to extensive competition from various domestic and foreign brands. These competitors compete with the Company’s licensees in terms of design, quality, price, product, advertising and service. We believe that our strong brand management platform and proven international partnerships as well as our experienced management team differentiate our Company from our competitors.
 Each brand has many competitors specific to certain distribution channels that span a broad variety of product categories, including the fashion apparel, home furnishings and decor, sports and entertainment industries. For example, Candies’ competes with respect to young women’s and juniors fast-fashion in the United States at the mid-tier channel with national brands like Express and XOXO, Starter competes with brands like Russell Athletic and C9 in the athletic apparel category, and Avia and And1 competes in the footwear category at the mass-tier channel. Umbro competes with global brands like Nike and Adidas in active-wear and with global and local brands in technical soccer categories.  Additionally, a significant portion of our brands also compete with big box retailers “private-label” and/or “exclusive” brands.
 The Company also faces competition in securing retail and wholesale licenses. Companies owning established brands may decide to enter into licensing arrangements with retailers or wholesalers similar to the ones the Company currently has in place, therefore creating direct competition. Similarly, the retailers that currently license our brands may decide to develop their own private labels and/or purchase brands rather than enter into license agreements with the Company.
 Lastly, in America, the Company competes for acquisitions with traditional apparel, consumer and entertainment brand companies, financial buyers and other brand management companies. Throughout the rest of the world, the Company also competes for the acquisition of global brands with strategic and financial buyers.
 Intellectual Property
 We believe that the Company’s worldwide IP portfolio, which includes trademarks, service marks, copyrights and other proprietary information, is our most valuable asset. As of December 31, 2018, we owned nearly 6,300 trademark and service mark registrations and applications – over 400 of which are domestic and over 5,800 of which are foreign. Trademarks and associated marks are registered or pending registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in other countries throughout the world in block letter and/or logo formats, as well as in combination with a variety of ancillary marks for use with respect to a variety of product categories, including footwear, apparel, fragrance, handbags, watches and various other goods and services, including in some cases, home accessories and electronics.  In addition, the Company owns numerous copyrights in its iconic Waverly and Joe Boxer patterns and designs. The Company also owns over 1,500 domain names worldwide and registers key domain names containing its trademarks.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a total of 122 full-time employees. Our full-time employees consisted of our CEO, senior managers, middle management, marketing and administrative personnel. Of the Company’s 122 full-time employees, 55 
 15


employees reside in the U.S., 61 reside in Europe, five in China, and one in the Middle East. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union. The Company considers its relationship with its employees to be satisfactory.
