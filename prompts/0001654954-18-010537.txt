  Company Background and Recent Developments
 
 Dynatronics Corporation designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes orthopedic soft goods, medical supplies, and physical therapy and rehabilitation equipment. Through our various distribution channels, we market and sell to orthopedists, physical therapists, chiropractors, athletic trainers, sports medicine practitioners, clinics, and hospitals.
 
 We conduct our operations at our headquarters in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, a suburb of Salt Lake City, and in other facilities located in Chattanooga, Tennessee; Northvale, New Jersey; and Eagan, Minnesota. Organized in 1983, Dynatronics has grown by adding product offerings, developing best-in-class distribution to meet the needs of our target customers, and acquiring complementary medical businesses in related fields.
 
 On October 2, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Bird & Cronin, Inc. (“Bird & Cronin”), a manufacturer and distributor of orthopedic soft goods and specialty patient care products. The Bird & Cronin acquisition has further expanded our sales reach into the orthopedic and patient care markets by leveraging their products and distribution network with our existing product and distribution strengths.

 Additional Recent Developments
 
 On June 26, 2018 (the “Transition Date”), our board of directors (“Board of Directors” or “Board”) appointed Christopher Richard von Jako, Ph.D. as our Chief Executive Officer and increased the size of the Board of Directors from six to seven members. Dr. von Jako was appointed to serve as a director to fill the newly created vacancy on the Board with a term expiring at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. As an employee director, Dr. von Jako will not be compensated for service on the Board of Directors apart from his compensation as an employee.
 
 Also as of the Transition Date, at the request of the Board, Kelvyn H. Cullimore, Jr. stepped down as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, a position he had held for 25 years. Mr. Cullimore will continue to serve as a non-employee director and member of the Board of Directors and will stand for re-election as a director at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

 Dr. von Jako served as President and CEO of NinePoint Medical, Inc. from November 2014 to June 2018. NinePoint Medical is a privately-held medical device company that designs, manufactures, and sells an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging platform for clinical use in gastroenterology for the evaluation of human tissue microstructure. He successfully secured a significant strategic investment and long-term partnership with Merit Medical Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MMSI) in April 2018. From May 2013 to November 2014, he was the President and CEO of NeuroTherm, Inc., a medical device company that develops, manufactures, and markets state-of-the-art image-guided solutions for pain management until its acquisition by St. Jude Medical Corporation (now Abbott). Prior to joining NeuroTherm, from 2010 to 2013, he served as President of ActiViews, Inc., a privately-held medical device company which developed and marketed minimally invasive tools for Interventional Radiology. In his nearly 25 years in the medical device industry, he also has worked in senior management positions at Radionics, a division of Covidien plc (now Medtronic plc), which he later sold to Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, and Medtronic plc. Dr. von Jako holds a Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Pécs Medical School (Pécs, Hungary), a M.S. degree in Radiological Sciences and Technology from the department of Nuclear Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA), and a double B.S. degree in Physics and Mathematics from Bates College (Lewiston, ME).
 
 There are no arrangements or understandings between Dr. von Jako and any other persons pursuant to which he was selected as an officer or director. He has no direct or indirect material interest in any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
 
 We entered into an employment agreement with Dr. von Jako (the “Employment Agreement”) dated May 24, 2018, which became effective on the Transition Date, which provides for the following: (i) an annual base salary of $275,000; (ii) a target annual cash bonus up to a maximum of 30% of base salary (provided that quantitative and qualitative objectives established by the Compensation Committee of the Board have been met); (iii) a new hire grant of stock options to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock and a restricted stock award of 50,000 shares, each vesting in four annual installments of 25% commencing on the first anniversary date of the Transition Date; and (iv) annual grants of stock options and restricted stock awards having an aggregate fair market value on date of grant of between $150,000 and $200,000 at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, with such fair market values determined with reference to a Black-Scholes model as to the options and the trading prices of the Company’s common stock as of the grant date as to the restricted stock award. Fifty percent of the new hire stock option grant and restricted stock awards will vest in the event of a termination of Dr. von Jako’s employment by us without cause during the first 12 months of his employment. In the event of a termination of his employment upon a change in control, all previously issued equity grants held by Dr. von Jako at the time of termination will vest in full, notwithstanding the terms of any equity incentive plan or applicable award agreements. Acceleration of vesting in any event will be subject to the execution of a general release of known and unknown claims in a form satisfactory to us.

 Dr. von Jako also has entered into our standard form of indemnification agreement for executives and directors and an Agreement Regarding Confidential Information, Ownership of Inventions, Non-Competition, Customer Non-Solicitation and Employee Non-Solicitation Covenants, and Acknowledgment of At-Will Employment, which are part of his Employment Agreement. Among other things, these agreements impose certain restrictions on Dr. von Jako, including compliance with post-employment covenants to (i) protect our confidential information; (ii) not accept employment with or provide services to a competitor for one year after termination; (iii) not solicit our employees or customers for two years after termination; and (iv) not disparage or otherwise impair the our reputation or goodwill.
 
 In February 2018, we created a new Therapy Products Division (“TPD”) consisting of our legacy Utah and Tennessee operations, and hired Brian D. Baker as the President of TPD. With this new alignment, we are now organized in three divisions, Hausmann, Bird & Cronin, and TPD, with the Presidents of each division reporting directly to the CEO, who reports to the Chairman of the Board.
 
  Our Products
 
 We sell products that are manufactured both by us and by third parties. Approximately 70% of our net sales (excluding freight, repairs, and miscellaneous items) in fiscal year 2018 were of products that we manufactured.
 
 We offer a broad line of products for physical therapy, orthopedic rehabilitation, and athletic training applications including orthopedic soft goods; therapeutic, athletic training, and orthopedic rehabilitation equipment and supplies; advanced-technology therapeutic medical devices; and therapeutic, medical, and custom athletic treatment tables.

  Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Equipment
 
 We sell power and manually operated treatment tables, mat platforms, parallel bars and work tables. We also sell training stairs, weight racks, and other rehabilitation and athletic training room products. Most of these products are manufactured at our Tennessee and New Jersey facilities.
 
 The New Jersey facility specializes in manufacturing high quality laminated med-surg and rehabilitation products. Laminate construction allows for better contamination control and ease of maintenance over other materials. Over 75% of Hausmann products are part of an unrivaled “Quick Ship” program promising shipment within one to 10 business days from date of order. Last year Hausmann shipped 98% of orders on time. One of the fastest growing segments of our business is the PROTEAM™ line of products for athletic training. The athletic training tables and taping stations are manufactured for and sold to professional and college teams in over 5,000 locations. At our Tennessee facility the focus is on solid wood products. Between the two facilities we cover the spectrum of products for a wide array of customers.  
 
 At our Utah facility we design, manufacture and distribute a broad line of devices that include electrotherapy, ultrasound, phototherapy, thermal therapy or a combination of these modalities in a single device. These modalities can be effective in treating pain, increasing local blood circulation, promoting relaxation of muscle spasms, preventing retardation of disuse atrophy, and accelerating muscle re-education.
  
 In addition to our own products, we also distribute a significant range of products from other manufacturers including exercise equipment, treatment tables, treadmills, walkers, compression therapy devices, stair climbers, parallel bars, laser light therapy equipment, shortwave diathermy, and radial pulse equipment.

  Sales Mix among Key Products
 
 No single product accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in fiscal years 2018 and 2017. Sales of products manufactured by us represented approximately 70% and 49% of total product sales, excluding freight and other revenue, in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in percentage of products manufactured in fiscal year 2018 can be attributed to the acquisitions of Hausmann in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and Bird & Cronin in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
 Patents and Trademarks
 
 Patents. We own a United States patent on our thermoelectric technology that will remain in effect until February 2033. We also hold a United States patent on our combination traction/phototherapy technology that will remain in effect until December 2026, and a United States patent on our phototherapy technology that will remain in effect until August 2025.
 
 Trademarks and Copyrights. We own trademarks used in our business, particularly marks relating to our corporate and product names. United States trademark registrations that are significant to our business, include Dynatron®, Dynatron Solaris®, Dynaheat®, Body Ice®, Powermatic®, Bird & Cronin®, Physician’s Choice®, and the Hausmann Logo.
 
 Federal registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered mark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third party anywhere in the United States, regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs. We may register additional trademarks in countries where our products are or may be sold in the future. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection provided by registration under U.S. law. Trademark protection continues in some countries so long as the trademark is used, and in other countries, so long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely. Our print materials are also protected under copyright laws, both in the United States and internationally.
 
 We also claim ownership and protection of certain product names, unregistered trademarks, and service marks under common law. Common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection that is afforded by the registration of a trademark. In addition, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used. We believe these trademarks, whether registered or claimed under common law, constitute valuable assets, adding to recognition of the Company and the effective marketing of our products.

 Trade Secrets. We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with key employees and other parties involved in research and development. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors.
 
 We intend to protect our legal rights in our intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel.
 
  Warranty Service
 
 We provide a warranty on all products we manufacture for time periods generally ranging in length from 90 days to five years from the date of sale. We service warranty claims on these products primarily at the Utah, Tennessee, New Jersey and Minnesota facilities depending on the product and service required. We also have field service available in other parts of the United States and Canada. Our warranty policies are comparable to warranties generally available in the industry. Warranty claims were approximately $123,000 in fiscal year 2018, and $144,000 in 2017.
 
 Distributed products carry warranties provided by the manufacturers of those products. We do not generally supplement these warranties or provide unreimbursed warranty services for distributed products. We also sell accessory items for our manufactured products that are supplied by other manufacturers. These accessory products carry warranties from their original manufacturers without supplement from us.
 
  Customers and Markets
 
 We sell our products to licensed practitioners such as orthopedists, physical therapists, chiropractors, and athletic trainers. Our customers also include professional sports teams and universities, sports medicine specialists, post-acute care facilities, hospitals, clinics, retail distributors and equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners. We utilize direct sales representatives and independent sales representatives to sell our products, together with a network of over 300 independent dealers throughout the United States and internationally. Most dealers purchase and take title to the products, which they then sell to end users.
 
 We have entered into agreements with independent hospitals and clinics, regional and national chains of physical therapy clinics and hospitals, integrated delivery networks, group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), and government agencies. We sell our products directly to these large groups, clinics, and hospitals pursuant to preferred pricing arrangements. No single customer or group of related accounts was responsible for 10% or more of net sales in fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
 
 We export products to approximately 30 different countries. Sales outside North America totaled approximately $3,606,000 in fiscal year 2018 (or approximately 5.6% of net sales) and $814,000 in fiscal year 2017 (or approximately 2.3% of net sales). Our Utah facility is certified to the ISO 13485 quality standard for medical device manufacturing. We have no foreign manufacturing operations, but we purchase certain products and components from foreign manufacturers.
 
  Competition
 
 We believe our key products are distinguished competitively by our use of the latest technology. Many of our competitors merely distribute competing products, whereas we are expected to manufacture the majority of the products that we sell. Also, our distribution channels provide important competitive advantages due to many established relationships with clinics which directly affect the sale and distribution of our products.
 
 We do not compete with any single competitor across all of our product lines and have numerous competitors of varying sizes, including personal care companies, branded consumer healthcare companies and private label manufacturers. Information necessary to determine or reasonably estimate our market share or that of any competitor in any of these markets of our highly fragmented industry is not readily available to us.

  Orthopedic Soft Goods and Medical Supplies
 
 We compete against various manufacturers and distributors of medical supplies and soft goods, some of which are larger, more established and have greater resources than Dynatronics. Excellent customer service, on-hand inventory of high quality products, along with providing online ordering capability and value to customers is of key importance for us to remain competitive in this market. Our competitors are primarily distributors such as Performance Health Holdings Corp. (“Performance Health”), Scrip, Inc., North Coast Medical, Inc. (“North Coast Medical”), and MeyerDC, and manufacturers such as Össur hf., DJO Global, Inc. (“DJO”), and Breg, Inc. All competitors of distributed products rely primarily on catalog, inside sales, or internet sales.
 Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Equipment
 
 Our primary competition in the physical therapy and rehabilitation equipment market is from domestic manufacturers including Hill Laboratories Company, Performance Health, Bailey Manufacturing Company, Tri W-G, Inc., DJO, Armedica Manufacturing Corporation, and Clinton Industries, Inc. We believe we compete in this market based on our industry experience and product quality. In addition, certain components of our equipment are manufactured overseas, which we believe allows for pricing advantages over our competitors.
 
     We compete in the clinical market for therapeutic modality devices with both domestic and foreign companies. Several of our products are protected by patents or where patents have expired, the proprietary technology on which those patents were based. We believe that the integration of advanced technology in the design of our products has distinguished Dynatronics-branded products in this very competitive market. For example, we were the first company to integrate infrared phototherapy as part of a combination therapy device. The introduction of the ThermoStim probe was the first of its product type on the market. We believe these factors give us a competitive edge. Approximately 10-15 companies produce devices directly competitive with our products. Some of these competitors are larger and are well established, and have greater financial resources than Dynatronics. We believe that our primary domestic competitors in the therapeutic device manufacturing market include DJO, Compass Health Brands and its affiliate Richmar, ThermoTek, Inc., Travanti Pharma, Inc., North Coast Medical, and Mettler Electronics Corp.
  
  Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 
 We manufacture our electrotherapy, ultrasound, phototherapy and traction therapy devices at our facility in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. We manufacture treatment tables, rehabilitation equipment, soft goods, and other medical products at our facilities in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Northvale, New Jersey and Eagan, Minnesota. Our manufactured products are made from custom components both fashioned internally from sourced raw materials, as well as purchased from third-party suppliers. All parts and components purchased from these suppliers meet established specifications. Trained staff performs all sub-assembly, final assembly and quality assurance testing by following established procedures. Our design and development process ensures that products meet the requirements of the medical device industry. The supply chain process manages quality suppliers of components and materials to ensure their availability for our manufacturing teams.
 
 The development and manufacture of a portion of our products manufactured at our Utah facility is subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and international regulatory agencies. In compliance with the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or CGMP, and standards established by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, we have developed a comprehensive Quality System that processes customer feedback and analyzes product performance trends. Conducting prompt reviews of timely information, allows us to respond to customer needs and ensure quality performance of the devices we produce.
 
 Our Utah facility is certified to ISO 13485:2003 standards for medical products. ISO 13485 is an internationally recognized quality management system standard adopted by over 90 countries.
 
 Products manufactured at our facility in Tennessee are subject to our internal quality system which is modeled on the quality system at our facility in Utah.
 
 Products manufactured at our facilities in New Jersey and Minnesota follow a similar pattern of compliance to an internal quality system that meets the requirements of CGMP. This quality system controls the production of products meeting the expectations of our customers for quality products and services.

  Research and Development
 
 Total research and development (“R&D”) expenses in fiscal year 2018 were $1,194,000, compared to approximately $1,081,000 in fiscal year 2017. The increase in R&D expenses was driven by $325,000 in costs incurred on a project which was abandoned, partially offset by a reduction in other R&D expense of approximately $212,000. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expenses represented approximately 1.9% and 3.0% in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Regulatory Matters
 
 The manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates some of our products pursuant to the Medical Device Amendment of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and regulations promulgated thereunder. Advertising and other forms of promotion (including claims) and methods of marketing of the products are subject to regulation by the FDA and by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, under the Federal Trade Commission Act.
 
 As a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and once registered we are subject to inspection for compliance with the FDA’s Quality Systems regulations. These regulations require us to manufacture our products and maintain related documents in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, and control activities. Further, we are required to comply with various FDA requirements for reporting customer complaints involving our devices. The FDC Act and its medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA if allegations are made that one of our products has caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if a malfunction of a product would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. The FDA also prohibits an approved device from being marketed for unapproved uses. All of our therapeutic treatment devices as currently designed are cleared for marketing under section 510(k) of the Medical Device Amendment to the FDC Act or are considered 510(k) exempt. If a device is subject to section 510(k) approval requirements, the FDA must receive pre-market notification from the manufacturer of its intent to market the device. The FDA must find that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device before the agency will clear the new device for marketing.
 
 We intend to continuously improve our products after they have been introduced to the market. Certain modifications to our marketed devices may require a premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) before the changed device may be marketed, if the change or modification could significantly affect safety or effectiveness. As appropriate, we may therefore submit future 510(k) notifications to the FDA. No assurance can be given that clearance or approval of such new applications will be granted by the FDA on a timely basis, or at all. Furthermore, we may be required to submit extensive preclinical and clinical data depending on the nature of the product changes. All of our devices, unless specifically exempted by regulation, are subject to the FDC Act’s general controls, which include, among other things, registration and listing, adherence to the Quality System Regulation requirements for manufacturing, medical device reporting and the potential for voluntary and mandatory recalls described above.
 
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as the Affordable Care Act, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law. The Affordable Care Act provides for a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of medical devices, including our products, effective as of 2013. The excise tax was suspended for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2016 and was further suspended through December 31, 2019. The passage of the Affordable Care Act imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain healthcare providers. Specifically, any transfer of value exceeding $10 in a single transfer or cumulative transfers over a one-year period exceeding $100 to any statutorily defined practitioner (primarily physicians, podiatrists, dentists and chiropractors, or a teaching hospital) must be reported to the federal government by March 31st of each year for the prior calendar year. The data is assembled and posted to a publicly accessible website by September 30th following the March 31st reporting date. If we fail to provide these reports, or if the reports we provide are not accurate, we could be subject to significant penalties. Several states have adopted similar reporting requirements. We believe we are in compliance with the Affordable Care Act and have systems in place to assure continued compliance.

 The medical device excise tax included in the Affordable Care Act is an excise tax on the first sale of medical devices by a manufacturer, producer, or importer equal to 2.3% of the sales price. Taxable medical devices include any device as defined in Section 201(h) of the FDC Act intended for humans, with the exception of eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids and any other device determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to be a type which is generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use (“exempt devices”). On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law H.R. 2029, the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016,” which included a two-year moratorium on themedical device excise tax, effective January 1, 2016. In January 2018, the tax was suspended for an additional two year period. The U.S. House of Representatives recently voted to repeal the tax on July 24, 2018. However, the U.S. Senate must also approve the repeal. Absent further legislative action, the tax will be automatically reinstated for medical device sales starting on January 1, 2020.
  
 In March 2017, the FDA published guidance relating to Class II devices that would no longer be required to submit a pre-market notification (510(k)). This list was finalized in the Federal Register on July 11, 2017. Among the Class II devices exempted by this determination are some phototherapy devices such as those manufactured by us. That guidance indicates that such devices are considered safe and effective without adding the burden of a pre-market approval by the FDA. While this change diminishes the regulatory burden for such products, it also lowers the barriers to entry for competitive products. We view this change as generally positive for us and our ability to leverage existing technology competencies in this segment.
 
 Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines, and criminal prosecutions. Any such action by the FDA could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products. Our Utah, Tennessee and New Jersey facilities are inspected periodically by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s CGMP and other requirements, including appropriate reporting regulations and various requirements for labeling and promotion. The FDA Current Quality Systems Regulations are similar to the ISO 13485 Quality Standard. The CGMP regulation requires, among other things, that (i) the manufacturing process be regulated and controlled by the use of written procedures, and (ii) the ability to produce devices that meet the manufacturer’s specifications be validated by extensive and detailed testing of every aspect of the process.
 
 Advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the FTC under the FTC Act. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Section 12 of the FTC Act provides that the dissemination or the causing to be disseminated of any false advertisement pertaining to, among other things, drugs, cosmetics, devices or foods, is an unfair or deceptive act or practice. Pursuant to this FTC requirement, we are required to have adequate substantiation for all advertising claims made about our products. The type of substantiation required depends upon the product claims made.
 
 If the FTC has reason to believe the law is being violated (e.g., the manufacturer or distributor does not possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. The FTC has a variety of administrative and judicial processes and remedies available to it for enforcement, including compulsory process authority, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, and divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of such orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any such action against us by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products.
 
 From time to time, legislation is introduced in the Congress of the United States or in state legislatures that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of medical devices and products like those we manufacture. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance, or interpretations will be changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be on our business and our results of operations. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, domestically or internationally, would have on our business in the future. They could include, however, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, and additional scientific substantiation. The necessity of complying with any or all such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
 
 In addition to compliance with FDA rules and regulations, we are also required to comply with international regulatory laws including Health Canada, CE Mark, or other regulatory schemes used by other countries in which we choose to do business. Foreign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future. Penalties for non-compliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions. Any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us. We believe all of our present products are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable performance standards in countries where the products are sold. We also believe that our products comply with CGMP, record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the products in the United States.

  Foreign Government Regulation
 
 Although it is not a current focus, we may expand our activities to market our products in European and other select international markets in the future. The regulatory requirements for our products vary from country to country. Some countries impose product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on some of the products we manufacture and distribute. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Environment
 
 Environmental regulations and the cost of compliance with them are not material to our business. Numerous federal, state and local laws regulate the sale of products containing certain identified ingredients that may impact human health and the environment. For instance, California has enacted Proposition 65, which requires the disclosure of specified listed ingredient chemicals on the labels of products sold in that state and the use of warning labels when such ingredients may be found. Although we do not believe that any of the ingredients in our current manufactured products is reportable under Proposition 65, this and other similar legislation may become more comprehensive in the future and/or new products we may develop or distribute could become subject to these regulations.
 Seasonality
 
 Our business is affected by some seasonality, which could result in fluctuation in our operating results. Sales are typically higher in our first and fourth fiscal quarters (the spring and summer months of the calendar year), while sales in our second and third fiscal quarters are generally slower (in the fall and winter months). Therefore, our quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.
 Employees
 
 On June 30, 2018, we had 336 employees, of which 323 were full-time employees and 13 were part-time employees. Included in these figures are 56 union employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in February 2019. We believe our labor relations with both union and non-union employees are satisfactory. By comparison, we had 233 employees (219 full-time and 14 part-time) on June 30, 2017.
