Item 1.  BUSINESS
Our Company

Strategic Overview

Teligent, Inc., is a specialty generic pharmaceutical company. All references to "Teligent," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Teligent, Inc. Our mission is to become a leader in the specialty generic pharmaceutical market. Under our own label, we currently market and sell generic topical and branded generic and generic injectable pharmaceutical products in the United States and Canada. In the United States we are currently marketing 35 generic topical pharmaceutical products and four branded generic pharmaceutical products. In Canada, we sell over 27 generic and branded generic injectable products and medical devices. Generic pharmaceutical products are bioequivalent to their brand name counterparts. We also provide contract manufacturing services to the pharmaceutical, over-the-counter, ("OTC"), and cosmetic markets. We operate our business under one segment. 
Our common stock is trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “TLGT.” Our principal executive office, laboratories and manufacturing facilities are located at 105 Lincoln Avenue, Buena, New Jersey. We have additional offices located in Iselin, New Jersey, Mississauga, Canada, and Tallinn, Estonia.

Currently, we have two platforms for growth:

•Developing, manufacturing and marketing a portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products in our own label in topical, injectable, complex and ophthalmic dosage forms; and
•Managing our current contract manufacturing and formulation services business.
We have been in the contract manufacturing and development of topical products business since the early 1990s, but our strategy since 2010 has been focused on the growth of our own generic pharmaceutical business. Since 2010, we have focused on transitioning our business to include more customers in the topical pharmaceutical industry. In 2014, we broadened our target product focus from topical pharmaceuticals to include a wider specialty pharmaceutical approach. We believe that expanding our development and commercial base beyond topical generics, historically the cornerstone of our expertise, to include injectable generics, complex generics and ophthalmic generics (what we call our "TICO strategy"), will leverage our existing expertise and capabilities, and broaden our platform for more diversified strategic growth.

In 2014, we acquired 23 drug products that had been previously approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Our pipeline includes 20 Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDAs"), on file with the FDA, for additional pharmaceutical products. In addition, we have 3 submissions on file with Health Canada. We have an additional 46 product candidates at various stages of our development pipeline. We submitted three ANDAs in 2018. We expect to continue to expand our presence in the generic topical pharmaceutical market through the filing of additional ANDAs with the FDA and the subsequent launch of products as these applications are approved. We received twelve approvals from our internally developed pipeline of topical generic products in 2018. We intend to continue to submit further ANDAs to the FDA and abbreviated new drug submissions ("ANDS") to Health Canada in 2019. We will also seek to license or acquire further products, intellectual property, or pending applications to expand our portfolio.
In addition, we may continue to explore ways to accelerate our growth through the creation of unique opportunities from the acquisition of additional intellectual property, and the expansion of the use of our existing intellectual property.

Teligent Canada. On November 13, 2015, we acquired all of the rights, title and interest in the development, production, marketing, import and distribution of all products of Alveda Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Alveda, pursuant to two asset purchase agreements, one relating to the acquisition of all of the intellectual property-related assets of Alveda and the other relating to the acquisition of all other assets of Alveda.

In connection with the closing of the acquisition, we formed three subsidiaries: Teligent Luxembourg S.à.r.l., or LuxCo, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and wholly-owned by the Company; Teligent OÜ, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Estonia that is wholly-owned by LuxCo; and Teligent Canada Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia that is wholly-owned by LuxCo.

Teligent Canada currently has 10 employees and located in our offices in Mississauga, Canada. Teligent Canada acquired all of the Alveda working capital, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and capital assets. In addition, Teligent Canada acquired Alveda’s existing customer relations, all contracts necessary to execute the Canadian distribution activities, operational permits, and all intellectual property required to operate the marketing and distribution of products in Canada. Teligent Canada also transitioned a majority of the existing workforce as part of the acquisition. Teligent Canada currently markets and distributes over 27 products. Teligent continues to transition these products to distribute them under a Teligent Canada label.

Teligent OÜ. Teligent OÜ currently has 13 employees. Teligent OÜ is responsible for the development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation functions related to the intellectual property-related assets acquired from Alveda. In addition, Teligent OÜ is responsible for the management of the supply chain function and procurement of products for sale to Teligent Canada in addition to certain products and active pharmaceutical ingredients ("API's") for Teligent Pharma, Inc. in the U.S. We built and developed a laboratory to support analytical chemistry, quality control, and formulation development to support our Teligent US and Teligent Canada supply chain management and technical services teams.

Facility Expansion. We completed the first phase of our facility expansion in July 2016, with the complete interior renovation of our building at 101 Lincoln Avenue in Buena, New Jersey. This building now houses our new product development laboratory for work on topical and sterile pharmaceuticals. This laboratory integrates our formulation and analytical chemistry teams into one lab. This building renovation also houses our regulatory affairs, supply chain and corporate service teams. 
We continued with the significant expansion and utilities upgrade of our manufacturing facility at 105 Lincoln Avenue in Buena, New Jersey. In October 2018, we received the Certificate of Occupancy to begin using our manufacturing facility, which includes a state-of-the-art quality control and microbiology lab for the testing of our pharmaceutical products. The expanded facility will increase our manufacturing capability for topical products and will also enable the production of sterile injectable products in both vial and ampule presentations. We are using this facility expansion as an opportunity to upgrade and improve the degree of automation and capacity in our existing topical production suite. The sterile production area is designed around isolator-based technology. The facility includes a versatile vial and ampule filling line capable of between four and eight million units per year, with space and critical utilities included in the build-out for a potential future higher-speed filling line. The current plans consider a total capital outlay for 105 Lincoln Avenue greater than $60 million. We have been partnering with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the development, registration and manufacture of some of our sterile injectable and ophthalmic products. Upon successful FDA inspection, we may transfer the manufacture of some of these injectable products to this facility. We will also use the new sterile production capability to support our internal R&D pipeline of sterile injectable products in vial and ampule presentations.

Our Generic Pharmaceutical Business

In September 2010, we leveraged our existing formulation and manufacturing capabilities to begin the Company’s transformation from being solely a contract manufacturing and development company into a generic pharmaceutical company with our own portfolio of products, as recognized by our first ANDA submission to the FDA. ANDAs are submitted to the FDA for generic drug products that have the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of administration as brand name innovator drug products to which they are bioequivalent, meaning that there is no significant difference between the drugs in their rate and extent of absorption in the body. In the United States, approved ANDA generic drugs are usually interchangeable with the innovator drug. This means that the generic version may generally be substituted for the branded product by either a physician or pharmacist when dispensing a prescription. Our commercialization of each of these product candidates requires approval of the respective ANDA by the FDA.

Based on IQVIA data, the addressable market, for the 20 products we have pending at the FDA totals approximately $1.5 billion in annual sales. We expect to continue to expand our presence in the generic topical pharmaceutical market through the submission of additional ANDAs to the FDA and the subsequent launch of products if and when these applications are approved by the FDA. Additionally, we plan to file further ANDSs with Health Canada in 2019. We also have 46 additional product candidates in various stages of development.

As part of our growth strategy, we also seek opportunities to acquire additional products and ANDAs or ANDSs. On February 1, 2013, we acquired assets and intellectual property, including an approved ANDA, for econazole nitrate cream 1%, which we launched under our label in September 2013. On September 24, 2014, we acquired from AstraZeneca previously approved ANDAs and NDAs associated with 18 products, 17 of which are injectable products and one non-injectable product for pain management. On September 30, 2014, we acquired previously marketed and approved ANDAs associated with two ophthalmic products from Valeant Pharmaceuticals LLC and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Luxembourg SARL, or Valeant, in addition to the
 exclusive right to acquire three additional previously marketed and approved injectable products from Valeant. In November 2014, we completed the purchase of one of those three optioned injectable products and its related NDA from Valeant. In March 2015, we completed the purchase of the final two optioned injectable products and their related NDAs from Valeant.

On November 13, 2015, we formed Teligent Canada, and completed the acquisition of Alveda. Teligent Canada currently has ten employees, including a general manager located in our offices in Mississauga, Canada. Teligent Canada acquired all of the Alveda working capital, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and capital assets. In addition, Teligent Canada acquired Alveda’s existing customer relations, all contracts necessary to execute the Canadian distribution activities, operational permits, and all intellectual property required to operate the marketing and distribution of Alveda’s products in Canada. Teligent Canada also transitioned a majority of the existing workforce as part of the acquisition. Teligent Canada currently markets and distributes 27 injectable products.

Our Contract Manufacturing and Development Business

We develop, manufacture, fill and package topical semi-solid and liquid products for branded and generic pharmaceutical customers, as well as the OTC and cosmetic markets. These products are used in a wide range of applications from cosmetics and cosmeceuticals to the prescription treatment of conditions like dermatitis, psoriasis and eczema.

We believe that our quality contract manufacturing and development business provides a consistent and reliable source of products and services to our customers. We offer flexibility in batch sizing and package design, which gives our customers the opportunity to select the appropriate presentation for each product. Our high-speed packaging lines can accommodate a variety of tubes, bottles, pumps and jars. As a result of the rollout of our TICO strategy and the increased focus and commitment of R&D and technical resources toward internal projects, revenue from our contract services business may decrease over time.

Our Financings

On December 16, 2014, we issued $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible 3.75% Senior Notes, due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”). On December 22, 2014, we announced the closing of the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of their option to purchase an additional $18.75 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.75% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2015, and mature on December 15, 2019, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The 2019 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, cash or a combination thereof. On May 20, 2015,we received shareholder approval for the increase in the number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance upon conversion of the 2019 Notes. 
On April 27, 2018, we entered into separate exchange agreements with certain holders of the 2019 Notes. The agreements gave the holders the right to exchange, in aggregate, $75.1 million of the 2019 Notes for $75.1 million of new Convertible 4.75% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”). The new 2023 Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 4.75% per year, payable semi-annually with the principal payable in May 2023. At the option of the holders, the 2023 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, cash or a combination thereof. The initial conversion rate is $224.71 per share, subject to certain adjustments, related to either our stock price volatility, or our declaration of a stock dividend, stock distribution, share combination or share split expected dividends or other anti-dilutive activities. In addition, holders will be entitled to receive additional shares of common stock for a potential increase of the conversion rate up to $280.90 per share under a make-whole provision in some circumstances. We incurred loan issue costs of $1.6 million upon issuance of the 2023 Notes. In accordance with accounting for convertible debt within the cash conversion guidance of ASC 470-20, we allocated the principal amount of the 2023 Notes between its liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was determined by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument of similar credit quality and maturity that did not have the conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the embedded conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the 2023 Notes as a whole. The equity component was recorded to additional paid-in capital and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The excess of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes over the carrying amount of the liability component was recorded as a debt discount of $19.0 million, and is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method through the maturity date. We allocated the total amount of transaction costs incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the 2023 Notes. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component were recorded as a direct deduction from the liability component of the 2023 Notes, and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method through the maturity date. Transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component of the 2023 Notes in additional paid-in capital. The effective interest rate of the 2023 Notes, inclusive of the debt discount and issuance costs, is 12.10%. 
On June 1, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement for $25.0 million secured by all of our assets, due June 1, 2021 (“2021 Term Loan”). The 2021 Term Loan has limited financial and non-financial covenants inclusive of a minimum cash carry balance of $5.0 million. The 2019 Notes and 2023 Notes are subordinate to the 2021 Term Loan. The first $15.0 million of loan proceeds was received on June 1, 2018. The remaining loan proceeds of $10.0 million were subject to closing conditions as defined in the agreement and were received on July 16, 2018. The 2021 Term Loan incurred loan issue costs of $0.5 million and a discount of $0.4 million. The discount is due to lender fees paid on the initial drawdown of $15.0 million. The issue costs and discount are recognized as interest expense over the term of the 2021 Term Loan. The 2021 Term Loan bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 9%, with a stated floor of 2%. The effective interest, inclusive of the debt discounts and issue costs is 12.78% as of September 30, 2018.  In December 2018 we used $25.6 million of proceeds from the Senior Credit Facilities (see below) to repay the 2021 Term Loan which was comprised of $25.0 million of principal, $0.5 million of transaction costs and $0.1 million of interest.. The repayment of the 2021 Term Loan is considered an debt extinguishment under ASC 470-50. We recorded $1.3 million of an extinguishment loss related to the repayment of the 2021 Term Loan in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
On December 13, 2018, pursuant to a Commitment Letter, dated November 12, 2018, between us and Ares Management LLC, we entered into: (i) a First Lien Revolving Credit Agreement, by and among the Company, as the borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and ACF Finco I LP, as administrative agent (the “Revolver Credit Agreement”) and (ii) a Second Lien Credit Agreement, by and among us, as the borrower, certain subsidiaries of ours, as guarantors, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Ares Capital Corporation, as administrative agent (the “Second Lien Credit Agreement” and, together with the Revolver Credit Agreement, the “New Senior Credit Facilities”). 
The New Senior Credit Facilities consist of (i) a $25.0 million senior revolving credit facility governed by the Revolver Credit Agreement (the “New Revolver”); (ii) a $50.0 million second lien initial term loan (the “New Initial Term Loan”); (iii) a $30.0 million second lien delayed draw term loan A (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan A”) and (iv) a $15.0 million second lien delayed draw term loan B (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan B” and, together with the Delayed Draw Term Loan A, the “Delayed Draw Term Loans” and, together with the New Initial Term Loan, the “New Term Loans”). The New Term Loans are governed by the Second Lien Credit Agreement. Our ability to borrow under the New Revolver is subject to a “borrowing base” to be determined based upon eligible inventory, eligible equipment, eligible real estate and eligible receivables. The Initial Term Loan of $50.0 million and $15.0 million of the Revolver were drawn by us on December 13, 2018. On December 21, 2018, we drew $20.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan A. As of December 31, 2018 the $10.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan A, $15.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan B and $10.0 million of the Revolver remain available to the Company. 
Use of Proceeds
The proceeds from the New Senior Credit Facility will be used for, among other things, the refinancing of certain of our outstanding indebtedness, including repayment of all borrowings under the Credit Agreement, dated as of June 1, 2018 for the 2021 Term Loan, among us, as the borrower, certain subsidiaries of ours, each as a guarantor, the lenders party thereto, and Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, as administrative agent (the “Existing Credit Agreement”), the repurchase or redemption of our outstanding 2019 Notes, as well as a construction project at our Buena, New Jersey facility, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, all as further set forth in the Revolver Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement. 
Interest and Fees
The interest rate under the New Revolver is calculated, at the option of us, at either the one, two, three or six-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (or LIBOR) plus 3.75% or the base rate plus 2.75%. The interest rate on the New Term Loans is calculated, at the option of the Company at either LIBOR plus 8.75% or the base rate plus 7.75%. Interest on the New Senior Credit Facilities is payable in cash except that interest on the New Term Loans is payable, at the option of us, in cash or in kind by being added to the principal balance thereof, until the earlier of December 13, 2020 and the date we have provided the lenders of the New Senior Credit Facilities financial statements demonstrating that we have attained twelve months of revenue of at least $125 million. A commitment fee of 1.0% per annum is payable by us quarterly in arrears on the unused portion of the Delayed Draw Term Loans. 
Amortization and Prepayment
The New Senior Credit Facilities are not subject to amortization prior to maturity. Amounts drawn under the New Revolver may be prepaid at the option of us without premium or penalty, subject, in the case of acceleration of the New Revolver or termination of the revolving credit commitments thereunder, to certain call protections which vary depending on the time at which such prepayments are made. Amounts drawn under the New Revolver are subject to mandatory prepayment to the extent that aggregate extensions under the New Revolver exceed the lesser of the revolving credit commitment then in effect and the borrowing base then in effect, and upon the occurrence of certain events and conditions, including non-ordinary course asset dispositions, receipt of certain insurance proceeds and condemnation awards and issuances of certain debt obligations. Amounts
 outstanding under the New Term Loans may be prepaid at the option of us subject to applicable premiums, including a make-whole premium, and certain call protections which vary depending on the time at which such prepayments are made. Subject to payment of outstanding obligations under the New Revolver as a result of any corresponding mandatory prepayment requirements thereunder, amounts outstanding under the New Term Loans are subject to mandatory prepayment upon the occurrence of certain events and conditions, including non-ordinary course asset dispositions, receipt of certain insurance proceeds and condemnation awards, issuances of certain debt obligations and a change of control transaction.
Guarantees and Collateral
The New Senior Credit Facilities were issued by the parent and guaranteed by subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The New Revolver and related obligations are secured by a first priority security interest in and lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiary guarantors (the "Collateral”), subject to certain exceptions. The New Term Loans and related obligations are secured by a second priority security interest in the Collateral, subject to certain exceptions. 
Covenants and Other Provisions
The New Senior Credit Facilities contain customary borrowing conditions, affirmative, negative and reporting covenants, representations and warranties, and events of default, including cross-defaults on other material indebtedness, as well as events of default triggered by a change of control and certain actions initiated by the FDA. In addition, effective March 31, 2019, we are required to comply at certain times with certain financial covenants consisting of a minimum revenue test, a minimum adjusted EBITDA test and a maximum total net leverage ratio. If an event of default occurs, the lenders of the New Revolver would be entitled to take enforcement actions, including foreclosure on Collateral and acceleration of amounts owed under the New Revolver, and the lenders under the New Term Loans would also be entitled to take such actions, subject to any limitations set forth in an intercreditor agreement with respect to the New Term Loans.
 Our Competitive Strategy

We develop and market a diversified product portfolio focused on alternative dosage forms. Our goal is to become a leader in the specialty generic pharmaceutical market. Under our own label, we currently market and sell generic topical and branded generic injectable pharmaceutical products in the United States and Canada. We also provide contract manufacturing services to the pharmaceutical, OTC, and cosmetic markets. We have been in the contract manufacturing and development of topical products business since the early 1990s, but our strategy since 2010 has been focused on the growth of our own generic pharmaceutical business. In 2014, we started the transformation of our business from working toward being a leader in the topical generic pharmaceutical industry to becoming a leader in the specialty pharmaceutical markets. We believe that expanding our development and commercial base beyond topical generics to injectable generics, complex generics and ophthalmic generics (what we call our TICO strategy), will leverage existing expertise and capabilities, diversify our commercial opportunities and broaden our platform for long-term strategic growth.
Our TICO Strategy

Our TICO strategy originated from our opportunity to leverage our value chain, which we have developed and strengthened through our topical portfolio. Our value chain includes our internal expertise in product and molecule selection and development, manufacturing, sales, logistics and distribution, as well as our relationships with our customers and consumers. With the expansion of our existing manufacturing facility, we see the potential to effectively leverage our existing infrastructure across this value chain and to further expand our strategic reach to the injectable, complex and ophthalmic generic pharmaceutical markets.

Topical (T) - Our focus on the topical market has been the foundation for our growth. While we have manufactured topical products since the early 1990s, we began to focus our strategy on the topical generic market in 2010. In December 2012, we launched our first generic topical pharmaceutical products under our own label. Currently, we market 34 topical products under our own label. We have received FDA approvals for 34 topical generic products from our internally developed pipeline.  In our topical pipeline, we have 20 ANDAs submitted to the FDA that are awaiting approval. We intend to continue to develop topical generic products and utilize our expertise in drug formulation and manufacture to expand our own generic topical prescription drug portfolio. We are targeting to develop and file further regulatory submissions with the FDA in 2019. Upon regulatory approval, we would market these products under the Teligent label to national chain drug stores and drug wholesalers through our internal sales efforts. 

In our topical contract services business, we have developed strong customer relationships that we believe provide us with both recurring revenue streams from those customers and opportunities to selectively increase our product offerings to our
 customers. We intend to continue to capitalize on our strong customer relationships to maintain some contract manufacturing and development revenues.

We have an FDA-registered, cGMP-compliant facility that is equipped for manufacturing topical, semi-solid and liquid products. The design and configuration of our manufacturing facility provides flexibility in manufacturing batch sizes from 250 kg up to 4,000 kg. We intend to leverage this flexibility and capacity to support our growth in the topical prescription markets. We are progressing with the significant expansion and utilities upgrade in this facility which will increase our manufacturing capacity for topical products to accommodate the expected growth created by the eventual commercial launch of the 34 topical generic pharmaceutical products in our pipeline.

Injectable (I) - As part of the injectable phase of our TICO strategy, on September 24, 2014, we acquired from AstraZeneca previously approved ANDAs and NDAs associated with 18 products, 17 of which are injectable products and one of which is a non-injectable product for pain management. Of the products we acquired, two of the products are currently on the FDA drug shortage list. We have received FDA approval for our first product in this portfolio, Cefotan® (Cefotetan for Injection), which we launched in the first quarter of 2016.
On September 30, 2014, we acquired previously marketed and approved ANDAs associated with two ophthalmic products from Valeant, in addition to the exclusive right to acquire three additional previously marketed and approved injectable products from Valeant. In November 2014, we completed the purchase of the NDA for one of those three optioned injectable products from Valeant. In March 2015, we completed the purchase of the final two NDAs for the optioned injectable products from Valeant.
On October 5, 2015, we acquired three currently marketed injectable pharmaceutical products (Fortaz®, Zinacef ™ and Zantac® Injection) from Concordia Pharmaceuticals Inc., S.à.r.l., Barbados Branch.

We intend to leverage our existing topical value chain as we build our injectable generic portfolio. We have entered into partnerships with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of some of our products in our portfolio of sterile products. Longer term, we expect to bring much of this production capability in-house.

The facility expansion, which completed construction activities in the fourth quarter of 2018 and is intended to file for and receive FDA approval in 2019, will also enable the production of sterile injectable products in both vial and ampule presentations. The sterile production area is designed around forward-thinking isolator-based technology. We have a portfolio of sterile injectable products we acquired in 2014, which upon completion of the site expansion, we may transfer the manufacture of some of these products to our Buena, New Jersey facility. We will also use the new sterile production capability to support our internal R&D pipeline of sterile injectable products in vial and ampule presentations.

We plan to continue to pursue business development opportunities to expand our injectable portfolio.

Complex (C) - We have begun three projects that we consider to be part of the complex portfolio of our TICO strategy. We filed one ANDA in the second quarter of 2017 for a generic version of an oral orphan drug and received a complete response letter from the FDA in the third quarter of 2018. The Company intends to respond to the FDA’s complete response letter in 2019. We consider our focus on complex products or markets to be broadly defined to include potential complexity in one of the critical areas of our industry value chain. As part of our complex program, we are researching two 505(b)(2) projects. A 505(b)(2) submission is an NDA that contains full safety and effectiveness reports, but permits some of the information required for approval to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant, thereby avoiding unnecessary duplication of studies already performed on a product. In addition, we are currently working with a contract research organization, or CRO, to develop a generic equivalent of a pharmaceutical drug product designated for a chronic rare disease.  The intent of this opportunity is to provide patients with a lower cost alternative of an approved orphan drug. The Orphan Drug Designation program at the FDA provides orphan status to drugs and biologics which are defined as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases/disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or that affect more than 200,000 persons, but are not expected to recover the costs of developing and marketing a treatment drug. We will continue to seek opportunities relevant to building our complex portfolio of products.

Ophthalmic (O) - As part of the ophthalmic portfolio of our TICO strategy, on September 30, 2014, we acquired previously marketed and approved ANDAs associated with two ophthalmic products from Valeant. Similar to our injectable portfolio, we are forming partnerships with CMOs for commercial production. We plan to continue to review business development opportunities to expand our ophthalmic portfolio. We are currently working with a contract research organization to develop three generic ophthalmic products. 

Our Customers

Generic Pharmaceutical Business. The manufacturing and commercialization of generic specialty pharmaceutical markets is competitive, and there are established manufacturers, suppliers and distributors actively engaged in all phases of our business. We currently manufacture and sell topical generic pharmaceutical products under our own label. In October 2015, we acquired and began to sell our first generic injectable products. We currently market over 27 products in Canada. As we continue to execute our TICO strategy, we will compete in other markets, including the injectable and ophthalmic generic pharmaceutical markets, and expect to face other competitors.

For the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, 54% and 52% of our total product sales, net, respectively, were to the three large wholesale drug distributors: AmerisourceBergen Corporation, or ABC; Cardinal Health, Inc., or Cardinal; and McKesson Drug Company, or McKesson. As of December 31, 2018, Cardinal accounted for 19% of our accounts receivable, ABC accounted for 19% of our accounts receivable, and McKesson accounted for 30% of our accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2017, Cardinal accounted for 44% of our accounts receivable, McKesson accounted for 15% of our accounts receivable, and ABC accounted for approximately 4% of our accounts receivable.

ABC, Cardinal and McKesson are key distributors of our products, as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies. None of these distributors is an end user of our products. Generally, if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease, we believe that the end users of our products would likely find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor. However, the loss of one or more of these distributors, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. There are generally three major negotiating entities in the US market. Walgreens Boots Alliance Development (WBAD) consists of Walgreens, AmerisourceBergen’s PRxO Generics program, and Econdisc members. Red Oak Sourcing consists of CVS and Cardinal’s source program. Finally, ClarusOne consists of Walmart, RiteAid and McKesson’s OneStop program. A loss of any of these major entities could result in a significant reduction in revenue.

We consider our business relationships with ABC, Cardinal and McKesson to be in good standing and have fee for services contracts with each of them. However, a change in purchasing patterns, a decrease in inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to analyze the market for other opportunities to expand our current relationships with other customers, while we continue to seek to diversify our existing portfolio of specialty generic drug products through internal research and development. In addition, we continue to explore business development opportunities to add additional products and /or capabilities to our existing portfolio.

Contract Manufacturing and Development Business. Our customers in the contract manufacturing business generally consist of pharmaceutical companies, as well as cosmetic and OTC product marketers, who require product development/manufacturing support. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 79% of our contract services revenue was derived from pharmaceutical customers, as compared to 86% of total contract services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. None of our contract manufacturing services customers represented 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 

Concentration of Risk. In 2018, we had sales to three customers which individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue.

Our Suppliers

We require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and third parties with which we have contracted. The principal components of our products are active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials. The APIs and other materials and supplies used in our pharmaceutical manufacturing operations are generally available and purchased from many different U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers. However, in some cases, the raw materials used to manufacture pharmaceutical products are available only from a single supplier. Even when more than one supplier exists, we may choose, and in some cases have chosen, only to list one supplier in our applications submitted to the FDA. Any change in a supplier not previously approved must then be submitted through a formal approval process with the FDA. 
Research and Development 

Our R&D activities are integral to our business and are conducted at our facility in Buena, New Jersey. Our R&D department is led by our Chief Scientific Officer, Stephen Richardson, who joined the Teligent team in October 2015. The R&D team is responsible for formulation, reverse engineering, methods development, analytical and microbiologic testing and scale up, and regulatory expertise. Our employees have specific expertise in developing injectable products and topical products in a wide range of dosage forms, including simple solutions through complex creams. All ANDA topical development is conducted in-house except for bioequivalence testing, which is performed by a contract research organization ("CRO"). Our injectable development is primarily conducted in house with some assistance from certain CRO's. 

We incurred $14.1 million, $19.3 million, and $17.1 million in R&D expenses in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As the business continues to grow over the next three to five years, we expect research and development costs as a percentage of revenue to decline.

Product Development and Government Regulation

United States

Prescription pharmaceutical products in the U.S. are generally marketed as either brand or generic drugs. Brand products are usually marketed under brand names through marketing programs that are designed to generate physician and consumer loyalty. Brand products are patent protected, which provides a period of market exclusivity during which time they are sold with little or no competition for the compound, although there typically are other participants in the therapeutic area. Additionally, brand products may benefit from other periods of non-patent market exclusivity. Exclusivity normally provides brand products with the ability to maintain their profitability for a period of time and brand products typically continue to play a significant role in the market due to physician and consumer loyalties after the end of patent protection or other market exclusivities.

Generic pharmaceutical products are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of the brand product, also known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. A reference listed brand drug is an approved drug product listed in the FDA publication entitled Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, popularly known as the Orange Book. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides that generic drugs may enter the market after the approval of an ANDA. An ANDA approval requires that bioequivalence to the reference listed drug be demonstrated and also requires that any patents on the corresponding reference listed drug be expired, invalidated, non-infringed and/or any other relevant market exclusivity periods related to the reference listed drug be expired as well. Generic drugs are bioequivalent to their reference brand name counterparts. Accordingly, generic products provide a safe, effective and cost-efficient alternative to users of these reference brand products. Branded generic pharmaceutical products are generic products in that they are approved for marketing under an ANDA, but they may be more responsive to promotion efforts generally used to promote branded pharmaceutical products. Growth in the generic pharmaceutical industry has been, and will continue to be, driven by the increased market acceptance of generic drugs, as well as the number of brand drugs for which patent terms and/or other market exclusivities have expired.

We obtain new generic products primarily through internal product development. Additionally, we license or co-develop products through arrangements with other companies. All applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling and quality control. Information to support the bioequivalence of generic drug products or the safety and effectiveness of new drug products for their intended use is also required to be submitted. There are generally two types of applications used for obtaining FDA approval of new products:

•New Drug Application — An NDA is filed when approval is sought to market a newly developed branded product and, in certain instances, for a new dosage form, a new delivery system or a new indication for a previously approved drug.
•Abbreviated New Drug Application — An ANDA is filed when approval is sought to market a generic equivalent of a drug product previously approved under an NDA and listed in the FDA’s Orange Book or for a new dosage strength for a drug previously approved under an ANDA.
The ANDA development process is generally less time-consuming and complex than the NDA development process. It typically does not require new preclinical and clinical studies, because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the RLD previously approved through the NDA process. The ANDA process, however, does typically require one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved reference listed brand drug. Bioequivalence studies compare the bioavailability of the proposed drug product with that of the RLD product containing the same active ingredient. Bioavailability is a measure of the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Thus, a demonstration of bioequivalence confirms the absence of a significant difference between the proposed product and the reference listed brand drug in terms of the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions.

Generic products are generally introduced to the marketplace at the expiration of patent protection for the brand product or at the end of a period of non-patent market exclusivity. However, if an ANDA applicant files an ANDA containing a certification of invalidity, non-infringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed in the Orange Book with respect to a reference drug product, the applicant may be able to market the generic equivalent prior to the expiration of patent protection for the brand product. Such patent certification is commonly referred to as a Paragraph IV certification. If the holder of the NDA sues, claiming infringement or invalidation, within 45 days of notification by the applicant, the FDA may not approve the ANDA application until the earlier of the rendering of a court decision favorable to the ANDA applicant or the expiration of 30 months. An ANDA applicant that is first to file a Paragraph IV certification is eligible for a period of generic marketing exclusivity. This exclusivity, which under certain circumstances may be required to be shared with other ANDA sponsors that have made Paragraph IV certifications, lasts for 180 days, during which the FDA cannot grant final approval to other ANDA applications for a generic equivalent to the same reference drug.

In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent market exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a generic version product. If the reference drug is a new chemical entity, the FDA may not accept an ANDA for a generic product for up to five years following approval of the NDA for the new chemical entity. If it is not a new chemical entity, but the holder of the NDA conducted clinical trials essential to approval of the NDA or a supplement thereto, the FDA may not approve an ANDA for a reference NDA product before the expiration of three years. Certain other periods of exclusivity may be available if the RLD is indicated for treatment of a rare disease or the sponsor conducts pediatric studies in accordance with FDA requirements.

Supplemental ANDAs are required for approval of various types of changes to an approved application and these supplements may be under review for six months or more. In addition, certain types of changes may only be approved once new bioequivalence studies are conducted or other requirements are satisfied.

An additional requirement for FDA approval of NDAs and ANDAs is that our manufacturing procedures and operations conform to FDA requirements and guidelines, generally referred to as current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. The requirements for FDA approval encompass all aspects of the production process, including validation and recordkeeping, the standards around which are continuously changing and evolving.

Facilities, procedures, operations and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and other authorities. In addition, the FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA regulations. Our suppliers are subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections.

In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, was enacted into law. FDASIA is intended to enhance the safety and security of the U.S. drug supply chain by holding all drug manufacturers supplying products to the U.S. to the same FDA inspection standards and schedules. Specifically, prior to the passage of FDASIA, U.S. law required U.S. based manufacturers to be inspected by the FDA every two years but remained silent with respect to foreign manufacturers, causing some foreign manufacturers to go as many as nine years without a routine FDA cGMP inspection, according to the Government Accountability Office.

FDASIA also included GDUFA, a novel user fee program focused on three key aims:

•Safety – Ensure that industry participants, foreign or domestic, are held to consistent quality standards and are inspected with parity using a risk-based approach.
•Access – Expedite the availability of generic drugs by bringing greater predictability to the review times for abbreviated new drug applications, amendments and supplements and improving timeliness in the review process.
•Transparency – Enhance FDA’s visibility into the complex global supply environment by requiring the identification of facilities involved in the manufacture of generic drugs and associated APIs, and improve FDA’s communications and feedback with industry.
Under GDUFA, 62% of the total fees are being derived from facility fees paid by Finished Dosage Form manufacturers and API facilities listed in pending or approved generic drug applications. The remaining 38% of the total fees are being derived from application fees, including generic drug application fees, prior approval supplement fees and fees for certain types of Drug Master Files, or DMFs.

Canada

In Canada, the registration process for approval of all generic pharmaceuticals has two tracks that proceed in parallel. The first track of the process involves an examination of the proposed generic product by Health Canada, the federal department responsible for national public health, to ensure that the quality, safety and efficacy of the proposed generic product meets Canadian standards and bioequivalence requirements. The second track concerns patent rights of the brand drug owner. Companies may submit an application called an abbreviated new drug submission, or ANDS, to Health Canada that compares the proposed generic drug to another drug marketed in Canada under a Notice of Compliance, or NOC, issued to a first person. When Health Canada is satisfied that the generic pharmaceutical product described in the ANDS satisfies the statutory requirements, it issues an NOC for that product for the uses specified in the ANDS, subject to any court order that may be made in the second track of the approval process.

The second track of the approval process is governed by the Patented Medicines NOC Regulations, or the Regulations. We currently do not have any applications in development that would utilize this track. 
Section C.08.004.1 of the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations is the so-called data protection provision, and the current version of this section applies in respect of all drugs for which an NOC was issued on or after June 17, 2006. A subsequent applicant for approval to market a drug for which an NOC has already been issued does not need to perform duplicate clinical trials similar to those conducted by the first NOC holder, but is permitted to demonstrate safety and efficacy by submitting data demonstrating that its formulation is bioequivalent to the formulation that was issued for the first NOC. The first party to obtain an NOC for a drug will have an eight-year period of exclusivity starting from the date it received its NOC based on those clinical data. A subsequent applicant for approval that seeks to establish safety and efficacy by comparing its product to the product that received the first NOC will not be able to file its own application until six years after the issuance of the first NOC. The Minister of Health will not be permitted to issue a NOC to that applicant until eight years after the issuance of the first NOC — this additional two-year period will correspond in most cases to the 24-month automatic stay under the Regulations. If the first person provides the Minister with the description and results of clinical trials relating to the use of the drug in pediatric populations, it will be entitled to an extra six months of data protection. A drug is only entitled to data protection so long as it is being marketed in Canada.

Facilities, procedures, operations and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by Health Canada. In addition, Health Canada conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems are in compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practices in Canada, Drug Establishment Licensing requirements and other provisions of the Regulations. Competitors are subject to similar regulations and inspections.

The federal government, provinces and territories in Canada operate drug benefit programs through which eligible recipients receive drugs through public funding; these drugs are listed on provincial or territorial Drug Benefit Formularies (each, a “Formulary”). Eligible recipients include First Nations and Inuit clients, seniors, persons on social assistance, low-income earners, and those with certain specified conditions or diseases. Formulary listings are also used by private payors to reimburse generic products. To be listed in a Formulary, drug products must have received an NOC from Health Canada and must comply with each jurisdiction’s individual review process. 

The primary regulatory approval for pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors and importers selling pharmaceuticals to be marketed in Canada is the issuance of an establishment license, or EL. An EL is issued to a Canadian facility once Health Canada has approved the facilities in which the pharmaceuticals are manufactured, distributed or imported. A key requirement for EL-issuance is compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practices as set out by Health Canada. For pharmaceuticals that are imported into Canada, the license for the Canadian importing facility must list all foreign sites at which imported pharmaceuticals, and their active ingredients, are manufactured and tested. To be listed on our EL, all our foreign sites must demonstrate compliance with relevant Good Manufacturing Practices recognized by Health Canada.

Sales and Marketing

We manufacture, sell, distribute and market our prescription drug products to national chain drug stores and drug wholesalers and distributors and group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, in the United States and Canada. This commercialization infrastructure includes satisfying our state, provincial, territorial, or national licensing requirements, implementing procedures with our third-party logistics partners, and maintaining appropriate sales order to cash administrative processes and a manager of national accounts to manage our sales.
Competition

In our generic topical prescription drug business, we face competition from other generic drug manufacturers and brand-name pharmaceutical companies through authorized generics. Although there are a significant number of competitors in the generic drug market, there are fewer competitors in the topical generic drug market. The five dominant companies in the topical generic drug market are: Perrigo Company, Sandoz (the generic pharmaceutical division of Novartis AG), Taro Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Mylan N.V., and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. We believe the concentrated nature of the topical generic drug market creates an opportunity for us to be able to compete based on a variety of factors, including our focus on niche opportunities within the market segment and our dedication to quality in every area of our business.

In our generic injectable prescription drug business, we also face competition from other generic drug manufacturers and brand-name pharmaceutical companies through authorized generics. Although there are a significant number of competitors in the generic drug market, there are fewer dominant competitors in the injectable generic drug market. The three dominant companies in the injectable generic drug market in the United States consist of Fresenius Kabi USA, Hospira, Inc. (a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc.) and Sandoz (the generic pharmaceutical division of Novartis AG). In Canada, we face competition from largely the same firms as in the United States as well as certain Canada-only firms.  The Canadian generic injectable market is dominated by Sandoz (the generic pharmaceutical division of Novartis AG), Pfizer Injectables and Fresenius Kabi Canada. 

Our generic injectable strategy is focused on injectable products with limited competition, and products that have a history of lack of supply, or instability in the supply chain, where we can add value and leverage on our ability to be a reliable supplier to the marketplace.  We believe the concentrated nature of some molecules within the injectable generic drug market, and history of lack of supply of certain molecules in the marketplace, create opportunities for us that we believe will enable us to compete based on a variety of factors, including our focus on niche opportunities within the market segment and our dedication to quality in every area of our business.

The contract manufacturing services market is highly competitive and includes larger organizations with substantially greater resources than us. Many of our competitors are companies that commercialize and/or manufacture their required products at their own facilities. These competitors include major pharmaceutical companies, generic drug manufacturers and consumer health product companies that generally have substantially greater manufacturing, R&D, marketing and financial resources than us and, in some cases, have more geographically diversified international operations. We compete specifically with a number of different privately-held contract manufacturing companies. Although this market is competitive, the competition is limited due to the need for specific expertise in topical formulations and cGMP facilities. We believe that we have the expertise required and we will continue to service our existing customers in this market by providing high quality, customer-oriented service, complemented by our contract development expertise in topical formulations.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent state and local regulatory agencies. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. Our manufacturing facility uses, in varying degrees, hazardous substances in its processes. Contamination at our facility can result and has resulted in liability to us, for which we
 have recorded appropriate reserves as needed. For example, two of the Company’s facilities have undergone remediation of environmental contamination. 

Intellectual Property

To compete effectively, we need to develop and maintain a proprietary position with regard to our technology, product candidates and business. Our goal is to safeguard our trade secrets and know-how, attain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology. We seek to achieve this protection through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents.

We depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and R&D personnel, as well as that of our consultants, advisors and collaborators. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely, and will continue to rely in the future, on confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to any other parties. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us their ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions. We understand that these agreements may not provide us with adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure.

We also seek to obtain patent protection when necessary, and we understand that this may not provide us with complete protection against competitors who may attempt to circumvent our patents.

Facility and Operations

The Company’s executive administrative offices are located in Buena, New Jersey, in two facilities which originally were approximately 33,000 square feet built on 8.44 acres of land in 1995, which we own. In 2017 we acquired an additional 3.0 acres of adjacent land in support of our facility expansion. We now own a total of 11.44 acres at our Buena facility. This facility is used for production, product development, marketing and warehousing for our pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical and cosmetic products. We completed construction on an expansion of our Buena, New Jersey facility to total approximately 110,000 square feet. Although the injectable manufacturing lines installed have yet to receive FDA approval, we received a Certificate of Occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2018 and are currently occupying the space. Once FDA approved, the expanded facility will increase our manufacturing capability for topical products and will also enable the production of sterile injectable products in both vial and ampule presentations. We are using this facility expansion as an opportunity to upgrade and improve the degree of automation and capacity in our existing topical production suite. The sterile production area is designed around isolator-based technology. Our capabilities encompass a full suite of competencies, including manufacturing, regulatory, quality assurance and in-house validation.

We operate our facility in accordance with cGMP. Our facility is registered with the FDA. We believe that our facility and equipment are in good condition, are well-maintained and are able to operate at present levels. Our manufacturing operations are focused on regulatory compliance, continuous improvement, process standardization and excellence in quality and execution across the organization.
We lease additional warehouse space in Vineland, New Jersey, as needed to complement our existing warehouse capacity.

The Company also leases approximately 9,500 square feet of corporate office space in Iselin, New Jersey, approximately 4,000 square feet of office space in Mississauga, Canada and approximately 3,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in Tallinn, Estonia. 

Employees

On December 31, 2018, we had a total of 189 full-time employees, including ten full-time employees in Canada and 13 full-time employees in Estonia. In addition, as the need arises, we occasionally utilize short-term, part-time employees who are paid on an hourly basis. We also utilize temporary employees provided by third-parties on a regular basis, primarily in our production department. We do not have a collective bargaining agreement with our employees and we believe that our employee relations are good.
