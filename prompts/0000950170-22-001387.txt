OUR PHYSICIAN SPECIALTIES AND SERVICES
 The following discussion describes our physician specialties and the care that we provide:
 Neonatal Care
 We provide clinical care to babies born prematurely or with complications within specific units at hospitals, primarily NICUs, through our network of affiliated neonatal physician subspecialists (“neonatologists”), neonatal nurse practitioners and other pediatric clinicians who staff and manage clinical activities at over 390 NICUs in 34 states and Puerto Rico. Neonatologists are board-certified, or eligible-to-apply-for-certification, physicians who have extensive education and training for the care of babies born prematurely or with complications that require complex

medical treatment. Neonatal nurse practitioners are registered nurses who have advanced training and education in assessing and treating the healthcare needs of newborns and infants as well as managing the needs of their families.
 We partner with our hospital clients in an effort to enhance the quality of care delivered to premature and sick babies. Some of the nation's largest and most prestigious hospitals, including both not-for-profit and for-profit institutions, retain us to staff and manage their NICUs. Our affiliated neonatologists generally provide 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week coverage in NICUs, support the local referring physician community and are available for consultation in other hospital departments. Our hospital partners benefit from our experience in managing complex intensive care units. Our neonatal physicians interact with colleagues across the country through an internal communications system to draw upon their collective expertise in managing challenging patient-care issues. Our neonatal physicians also work collaboratively with maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists to coordinate the care of mothers experiencing complicated pregnancies and their fetuses.
Maternal-Fetal Care
 We provide inpatient and office-based clinical care to expectant mothers and their unborn babies through our affiliated maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists as well as obstetricians and other clinicians, such as maternal-fetal nurse practitioners, certified nurse mid-wives, ultrasonographers and genetic counselors. Maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists are board-certified, or eligible-to-apply-for-certification, obstetricians who have extensive education and training for the treatment of high-risk expectant mothers and their fetuses. Our affiliated maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists practice primarily in metropolitan areas where we have affiliated neonatologists to provide coordinated care for women with complicated pregnancies whose babies are often admitted to a NICU upon delivery. We believe continuity of treatment from mother and developing fetus during the pregnancy to the newborn upon delivery has improved the clinical outcomes of our patients.
 Pediatric Cardiology Care
 We provide inpatient and office-based pediatric cardiology care of the fetus, infant, child and adolescent patient with congenital heart defects and acquired heart disease, as well as adults with congenital heart defects through our affiliated pediatric cardiologist subspecialists and other related clinical professionals such as pediatric nurse practitioners, echocardiographers, other diagnostic technicians, and exercise physiologists. Pediatric cardiologists are board-certified, or eligible-to-apply for certification, pediatricians who have additional education and training in congenital heart defects and pediatric acquired heart disorders.
We provide specialized cardiac care to the fetus, neonatal and pediatric patients with congenital and acquired heart disorders, as well as adults with congenital heart defects, through scheduled office visits, hospital rounds and immediate consultation in emergency situations. Our affiliated pediatric cardiologists work collaboratively with neonatologists and maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists to provide a coordinated continuum of care.
Other Pediatric Subspecialty Care
 Our network includes other pediatric subspecialists such as pediatric intensivists, pediatric hospitalists, pediatric surgeons, pediatric ophthalmologists and pediatric ear, nose and throat physicians. In addition, our affiliated physicians seek to provide support services in other areas of hospitals, particularly in the pediatric emergency room, labor and delivery area, and nursery and pediatric departments, where immediate accessibility to specialized care may be critical.
Pediatric Intensive Care. Pediatric intensivists are hospital-based pediatricians with additional education and training in caring for critically ill or injured children and adolescents. Our affiliated physicians who provide this clinical care staff and manage pediatric intensive care units (“PICUs”) at over 70 hospitals.
Pediatric Hospitalists. Pediatric hospitalists are hospital-based pediatricians specializing in inpatient care and management of acutely ill children. Our affiliated hospital-based physicians provide this inpatient pediatric and newborn care in PICUs, NICUs and pediatric emergency rooms at approximately 60 hospitals.


Pediatric Surgery. Pediatric surgeons provide specialized care for patients ranging from newborns to adolescents, for all problems or conditions that require surgical intervention, and often have particular expertise in the areas of neonatal, prenatal, trauma, and pediatric oncology. Our affiliated physicians in this subspecialty include pediatric urologists, pediatric plastic and craniofacial surgeons and general and thoracic pediatric surgeons. Areas of particular expertise include management of neonatal and congenital anomalies, prenatal counseling, trauma management, pediatric oncology, gastrointestinal surgery, as well as common pediatric surgical conditions.
 Pediatric Urology. Pediatric urologists are specialized pediatric surgeons who diagnose, treat and manage children’s urinary and genital problems. Our affiliated physicians provide consults for all pediatric and fetal genitourinary disorders; bladder, kidney and genitalia reconstructive and corrective surgery; cystoscopy; circumcision; ultrasound; and urinalysis services to children.
 Pediatric Ear, Nose and Throat (“ENT”). Pediatric ENT physicians treat conditions that affect a child’s ear, nose, throat and neck. Our affiliated physicians in this subspecialty provide all aspects of ear, nose and throat medical, audiology and surgical services, including ear tubes, tonsillectomies and sinus surgery.
 Pediatric Ophthalmology. Pediatric ophthalmologists focus on the development of the visual system and various diseases that disrupt visual development in children. Our affiliated physicians in this subspecialty specialize in retinopathy of prematurity screening and visual care consulting services.
 Other Newborn and Pediatric Care. Because our affiliated physicians and advanced nurse practitioners generally provide hospital-based coverage, they are situated to provide highly specialized care to address medical needs that may arise during a baby’s hospitalization. For example, as part of our ongoing efforts to support and partner with hospitals and the local referring physician community, our affiliated neonatologists, pediatric hospitalists and advanced nurse practitioners provide in-hospital nursery care to newborns through our newborn nursery program. This program is made available for babies during their hospital stay, which in the case of healthy babies typically consists of evaluation and observation, following which they are referred, and their hospital records are provided, to their pediatricians or family practitioners for follow-up care.
 Pediatric Urgent Care. We made our entry into the pediatric urgent care service line in early 2021 with the affiliation with an eight clinic pediatric urgent care practice that provides screening, diagnosis and treatment for a variety of minor non-emergent health issues, working in partnership with community pediatricians.
Newborn Hearing Screening Program. Our affiliated physicians also oversee our newborn hearing screening program. Since we launched this program in 1994, we believe that we have become the largest provider of newborn hearing screening services in the United States. In 2021, we screened over 885,000 babies for potential hearing loss at 415 hospitals across the nation. Over 40 states either require newborns to be screened for potential hearing loss before being discharged from the hospital or require that parents be offered the opportunity to submit their newborns to hearing screens. We contract or coordinate with hospitals to provide newborn hearing screening services.
 Clinical Research, Education, Quality and Safety
 As part of our ongoing commitment to improving patient care through evidence-based medicine, we also conduct clinical research, monitor clinical outcomes and implement clinical quality initiatives with a view to improving patient outcomes, shortening the length of hospital stays and reducing long-term health system costs. Our physician-centric approach to clinical research and continuous quality improvement has demonstrated improvements in clinical outcomes, while reducing the costs of care associated with complications as well as variability in protocols. We provide extensive continuing medical education and continuing nursing education to our affiliated clinicians in an effort to ensure that they have access to current treatment methodologies, national best practices and evidence-based guidelines. We believe that referring and collaborating physicians, hospitals, third-party payors and patients all benefit from our clinical research, education, quality and safety initiatives.
DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES
 Hospital-Based Care. Hospitals generally must provide cost-effective, quality care in order to enhance their reputations within their communities and desirability to patients, referring and collaborating physicians and third-party payors. In an effort to improve outcomes and manage costs, hospitals typically employ or contract with physician specialists to provide specialized care in many hospital-based units or settings. Hospitals traditionally staff these units or settings through affiliations with local physician groups or independent practitioners. However, management of these units and settings presents significant operational challenges, including variable admissions rates, increased operating costs, complex reimbursement systems and other administrative burdens. As a result, some hospitals choose to contract with physician organizations that have the clinical quality initiatives, information and reimbursement systems and management expertise required to effectively and efficiently operate these units and settings in the current healthcare environment. With continuing shifts to value-based reimbursement models, we anticipate that hospitals will continue to seek out experienced organizations with documented success in improving quality indicators and reducing costs. Demand for hospital-based physician services, including neonatology, is determined by a national market in which qualified physicians with advanced training compete for hospital contracts.
 Neonatal Medicine. Of the just over 3.6 million births in the United States annually, we estimate that 14%-15% require NICU admission. Numerous institutions conduct research to identify potential causes of premature birth and medical complications that often require NICU admission. Some common contributing factors include the presence of hypertension or diabetes in the mother, lack of prenatal care, complications during pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse and smoking or poor nutritional habits during pregnancy. Babies admitted to NICUs typically have an illness or condition that requires the care of a neonatologist. Babies who are born prematurely or have a low birth weight often require neonatal intensive care services because of an increased risk for medical complications. We believe obstetricians generally prefer to perform deliveries at hospitals that provide a full complement of labor and delivery services, including a NICU staffed by board-certified, or eligible-to-apply-for-certification, neonatologists. Because obstetrics is a significant source of hospital admissions, hospital administrators have responded to these demands by establishing NICUs and contracting with independent neonatology group practices, such as our affiliated professional contractors, to staff and manage these units. As a result, NICUs within the United States tend to be concentrated in hospitals with higher volumes of births. There are approximately 6,350 board-certified neonatologists in the United States.
 Maternal-Fetal Medicine. Expectant mothers with pregnancy complications often seek or are referred by their obstetricians to maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists. These subspecialists provide inpatient and office-based care to women with conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, multiple gestation, recurrent miscarriage, family history of genetic diseases, suspected fetal birth defects and other complications during their pregnancies. We believe that improved maternal-fetal care has a positive impact on neonatal outcomes. Data on neonatal outcomes demonstrates that, in general, the likelihood of mortality or an adverse condition or outcome (referred to as “morbidity”) is reduced the longer a baby remains in the womb. There are approximately 2,650 board-certified maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists in the United States.
 Pediatric Cardiology Medicine. Pediatric cardiologists provide inpatient and office-based cardiology care of the fetus, infant, child, and adolescent with congenital heart defects and acquired heart disease, as well as providing care to adults with congenital heart defects. We estimate that approximately one in every 145 babies is born with some form of heart defect. With advancements in care, there are approximately 1.4 million adults in the United States today living with congenital heart disease. There are approximately 3,300 board-certified pediatric cardiologists in the United States.
 Pediatric Primary and Urgent Care. Pediatric urgent care practices provide screening, diagnosis and treatment for a variety of minor non-emergent health issues, working in partnership with community pediatricians. We envision a new model comprising urgent/acute care, primary care and telehealth. Patient services offered in the traditional pediatric urgent care clinic will be expanded to include the full pediatric continuum of care, including subspecialty services and primary care services with an integrative approach to pediatric health, general and developmental pediatrics for high-risk newborns, complementary prenatal services with a focus on patient education and wellness, behavioral health and chronic pediatric diseases.


Other Pediatric Subspecialty Medicine. Other areas of pediatric subspecialty medicine are closely associated with maternal-fetal-newborn medical care. For example, pediatric intensivists are subspecialists who care for critically ill or injured children and adolescents in PICUs. There are approximately 2,800 board-certified pediatric intensivists in the United States. As another example, pediatric hospitalists are pediatricians who provide care in many hospital areas, including labor and delivery and the newborn nursery. In addition, pediatric surgeons provide specialized care for patients ranging from newborns to adolescents, for all problems or conditions affecting children that require surgical intervention, and often have particular expertise in the areas of neonatal, prenatal, trauma, and pediatric oncology. There are approximately 1,070 board-certified pediatric surgeons in the United States. Pediatric urologists are specialized pediatric surgeons who diagnose, treat and manage children’s urinary and genital problems. There are approximately 400 board-certified pediatric urologists in the United States.
Physician Practice Administration. Administrative demands and cost containment pressures from a number of sources, principally commercial and government payors, make it increasingly difficult for physicians to effectively manage patient care, remain current on the latest procedures and efficiently administer non-clinical activities. As a result, we believe that physicians remain receptive to being affiliated with larger organizations that reduce administrative burdens, achieve economies of scale and provide value-added clinical research, education and quality initiatives. By relieving many of the burdens associated with the management of a subspecialty group practice, we believe that our practice administration services permit our affiliated physicians to focus on providing quality patient care and thereby contribute to improving patient outcomes, ensuring appropriate length of hospital stays and reducing long-term health system costs. In addition, our national network of affiliated physician practices, modeled around a traditional group practice structure, is managed by a non-clinical professional management team with proven abilities to achieve significant operating efficiencies in providing administrative support systems, interacting with physicians, hospitals and third-party payors, managing information systems and technologies, and complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations.
 OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
 Our business objective is to enhance our position as a leading provider of physician and other complementary healthcare services. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this objective are:
 •Build upon core competencies. We have developed significant administrative expertise relating to our practice physician services. We have also facilitated the development of a clinical approach to the practice of medicine among our affiliated physicians through clinical data warehouses that include research, education and quality initiatives intended to advance the practice of medicine and care, improve the quality of care provided to our patients and reduce long-term health system costs. Analysis of the data within our clinical data warehouses across our neonatology and other pediatric subspecialty services allows us to provide feedback to our physicians and hospital partners and to develop and implement best practices, all with the goal of improving outcomes, creating efficiencies and ensuring patient satisfaction. As healthcare organizations are expected to increasingly be held accountable for the quality and cost of the care they provide, we believe that our ability to capture this data within our clinical data warehouses adds value to our patients and our hospital and physician partners. 
 •Utilize enhanced technology solutions. We are introducing several technology-enabled solutions that we believe will improve the efficiency of the work our affiliated physicians do each day. These include a more streamlined charge capture system, a cloud-based image access and storage solution, continued development of our cloud-based neonatology-specific notes system and upgrades to our office-based practices electronic health record system that are designed to be better for our physicians and improve the patient-facing portal for our patients and their families. We plan to continue to find ways to supply real time data to our affiliated physician practices so that they can see, and more importantly manage, patient volumes.
 •Promote same-unit and organic growth. We seek opportunities for increasing revenue from our hospital- and office-based operations. For example, our affiliated hospital-based neonatal, maternal-fetal and other pediatric physicians are well situated to, and, in some cases, provide physician services in other departments, such as pediatric emergency rooms, newborn nurseries, or in situations where immediate accessibility to specialized obstetric and pediatric care may be critical. Our hospital-based and office-based 


physicians continue to pursue an organic growth strategy that involves working with our hospital partners to develop integrated service programs for which we become a provider of solutions across the maternal-fetal, newborn, pediatric continuum of care. An integrated program results in a broader offering of care across our specialties and permits the extension of our service lines in our markets. We have successfully executed this organic growth strategy and market partnership in many metropolitan areas and intend to continue this growth initiative in the future. In addition, we market our capabilities to obstetricians, pediatricians and family physicians to attract referrals to our hospital-based units and our office-based practices. We also market the services of our affiliated physicians to other hospitals to attract maternal, neonatal and pediatric transport admissions. In addition, we may pursue new contractual arrangements with hospitals, including possibly through joint ventures, either where we currently provide or do not currently provide physician services.
Additionally, with the goal of further expanding our organic growth, our national sales team pursues opportunities across our service lines by employing a targeting strategy with a specific focus and prioritization. This sales team works with existing hospital and other healthcare partners and also focuses on building new relationships with hospitals and other service providers to which we do not currently provide services in order to offer clinical and other solutions and respond to requests for proposals. Our growth teams are managed under one collaborative group that addresses acquisition and organic growth opportunities with the shared goal of Mednax being viewed by hospitals and other partners as a multi-specialty health solutions partner across all of its women’s health and pediatrics service lines. The growth team partners with the operational leadership across each of our medical groups to execute our overall growth strategy.
•Adaptation and Expansion of Telehealth.  Our robust telehealth programs offer the latest in telemedicine, which is the use of telecommunication and information technology in order to provide clinical healthcare at a distance. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, we had focused on expanding our services in telemedicine as we have long expected that many pediatric subspecialties, as well as maternal-fetal medicine, will benefit in the future from having a robust platform in telemedicine. Telemedicine services are well documented as high quality, safe and efficient means of expanding physician services into metropolitan and rural communities. We have expanded our services to provide these remote programs to our hospital partners. We believe telehealth reduces overall healthcare spending, improves access to quality care and facilitates collaboration with specialists while improving patient engagement and satisfaction. As a result of these benefits, we believe these programs enhance the standing of our hospital partners while creating another portal of entry of pediatric patients to our inpatient service lines. 
 •Acquire physician practice groups. We continue to seek to expand our operations by acquiring established physician practices in our core physician specialties and pursuing complementary pediatric subspecialty physician groups outside of our core specialties when appropriate. During 2021, we added nine physician practices consisting of one pediatric orthopedic practice, one multi-location pediatric primary and urgent care practice, one pediatric cardiology practice, two pediatric neurology practices, one maternal-fetal medicine practice, one obstetrics and gynecology practice, one pediatric intensivist. practice and one neonatology practice. 
 •Pediatric primary and urgent care. We are in the early stages of building our presence in children’s primary and urgent care. We believe that providing pediatric primary and urgent care in patient friendly, dedicated clinics will allow us to give patients easier access to the specialists across our organization when they need it, and will also help strengthen our relationships with the communities where we provide services, and with our hospital partners. With our concentration of pediatrician population density, hospital relationships and partnerships, a large and growing base of vital patient relationships, and market managerial support in place, we believe we are well-positioned to grow in this area through de novo development and acquisitions that we can integrate into our strategic growth.
 To facilitate this growth, we made an investment in a technology platform entity to provide access to scalable internal controls and patient facing technology, systems and protocols, that would otherwise take us years to create. These technology systems and their operating platform give patients and their parents

a seamless experience when they visit. The technology also provides remote connectivity to clinicians through a user friendly remote mobile app, so parents always have a resource at their fingertips.
 With our current geography of existing services, we believe there is an opportunity for us to expand our growth in this area with a meaningful number of primary and urgent care clinics across our footprint over the next several years.
 •Strengthen and broaden relationships with our partners. By managing many of the operational challenges associated with physician practices, encouraging clinical research, education, quality, and safety initiatives, and promoting timely intervention by our physicians, we believe that our business model is focused on improving the quality of care delivered to patients, promoting the appropriate length of their hospital stays and optimizing efficient use of health system resources. We believe that referring and collaborating physicians, hospitals, third-party payors and patients all benefit to the extent that we are successful in implementing our business model. In addition, we plan to continue to concentrate efforts in becoming more responsive and proactive in broadening our existing hospital relationships to expand the scope of services that we provide across all specialties. We focus our efforts in this area using a market-based approach and in each geographic area where we operate we consider how we can expand our existing hospital and health system relationships and form new ones. We believe this is critical as hospitals and health systems seek to expand their service offerings and as the broader healthcare market seeks new solutions to operate more efficiently.
 We also believe one of the greatest predictors of success in our partnerships at the hospital and health system level is a high degree of strategic alignment between our clinical leaders and our partners. This requires our clinicians to hone a skill set beyond just the practice of medicine. To this end, we are relaunching our Clinical Leadership Development Program where our affiliated clinicians from across the organization will participate in a variety of leadership workshops to provide them with the best tools to foster positive productive relationships with our valued partners.
 CLINICAL RESEARCH, EDUCATION, QUALITY AND SAFETY
 As part of our patient focus and ongoing commitment to improving patient care through evidence-based medicine, we engage in clinical research, continuous quality improvement, safety and education initiatives. Our goal is to discover, understand and teach healthcare practices that enhance the abilities of clinicians to deliver quality care, thereby contributing to better patient outcomes and reduced long-term health care costs. These initiatives benefit our patients, clinicians, referring and collaborating physicians, hospital partners and third-party payors. Our goal is to enhance the value of our services, attract new and retain high-quality clinicians, improve clinical operations and enhance practice communication.

•Clinical Research. We conduct clinical research to discover ways to improve clinical care for our patients. We share our discoveries throughout the medical community by publishing our observations in peer-reviewed medical journals. To help facilitate and support research efforts, Mednax has a Research Advisory Committee (“RAC”). The goal of the RAC is to design, implement and maintain a program for clinical research oversight and support that enables our practices to conduct research that is safe, effective, financially viable and legally compliant. The RAC’s multi-disciplinary approach involves the collaboration of both clinical and business professionals, including finance, legal and compliance. With participating clinicians located throughout the country, the RAC supports a comprehensive scope of research efforts. This nationwide perspective allows us to better anticipate future needs and opportunities.
    •Quality and Safety. Through the leadership of our affiliated clinicians, we have cultivated a culture of continuous quality improvement and safety, which is the cornerstone of our success and helps us to fulfill our mission. Our team of clinical experts leads and provides oversight of national quality and safety programs across various specialties and subspecialties. 
    •Continuous Quality Improvement (“CQI”). CQI initiatives are important for our clinicians. We provide our clinicians with the opportunity to collaborate and share best practices and facilitate access to valuable 


information, resources, and professional development tools. Our affiliated clinicians can identify areas for improvement, and then systematically monitor, study, learn, and implement change. Complex initiatives are derived and based on our long-standing CQI efforts, such as our 100,000 Babies Campaign, our value-based care initiatives, and various clinical quality collaboratives. Our quality metrics include standard clinical outcome reporting, trend analysis and threshold performance, which are provided to our affiliated clinicians.
    •Patient Safety Organization (“PSO”). We have a federally-listed PSO, the mission of which is to improve the quality and safety of care rendered by our clinical providers through the collection and analysis of quality data. As a federally-listed PSO, our mission to improve the safety of care rendered is supported by the dissemination of best practices information and implementation of patient safety programs. Our Women’s and Children’s National High Reliability Organization ("HRO") program aims to provide “Just Culture” training to our clinicians. The complex curriculum has been customized to meet our affiliated physician practices’ needs and is based on principles outlined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (“AHRQ”), Institute for Healthcare Improvement, National Patient Safety Foundation and Team STEPPS, the teamwork system developed by the AHRQ and the Department of Defense.
    •Medical Simulation. Practicing critical decision-making, communication, task and teamwork skills with in situ scenarios promotes optimized clinical performance for high-risk, low-volume critical situations. To meet the needs of our health care providers and hospital partners, we offer a variety of customized simulation programs with the aim of instilling competence and confidence with one goal in mind: improved outcomes. Our simulation program has earned full accreditation status from the Society for Simulation in Healthcare in Teaching/Education and Systems Integration and currently offers highly interactive programs for neonatology and hospital-based medicine practices. Medical simulation is proven as a performance improvement method, enhances communication and improves patient outcomes.
    •Education. We provide continuing medical and nursing education to our affiliated clinicians to ensure that they have access to current treatment methodologies, national best practices, and evidence-based guidelines. The Mednax Center for Research, Education, Quality and Safety is accredited with commendation by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education and accredited by the American Nurses Credentialing Center’s Commission on Accreditation. As an accredited provider of continuing medical and nursing education, we offer a variety of live and online educational credit opportunities that can be accessed on demand by our providers and are in synergy with latest research publications and healthcare industry standards. We are expanding our learning materials to new subspecialties. In addition, each year, thousands of healthcare providers worldwide take advantage of educational programs hosted by Mednax. We believe that the number of clinicians both nationally and internationally who participate in these activities is evidence of the depth and breadth of our clinical expertise and position as an industry leader.
    •Innovation. We believe collaborative innovation is a pathway towards excellence in research, education, quality and safety. Because of the critical role innovation plays, our team strives to integrate the latest technological advances, artificial or augmented intelligence, genomics and mobile applications into everyday care. Tele- and mobile health, virtual reality, point-of-care diagnostics and advanced data analytics are currently shaping the future of medicine. Our team is actively engaged in integrating the latest innovations that can optimize clinical care delivery and augment our clinical research initiatives with the goal of further optimizing patient outcomes.
    We believe that these initiatives have been enhanced by our integrated national presence together with our clinical and management information systems, which are an integral component of our clinical research and education activities. See “Our Information Systems.”


OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS
 We maintain several information systems that support our day-to-day operations, ongoing clinical initiatives and business analysis.
•BabySteps®. BabySteps is a clinical electronic documentation system used by our affiliated neonatal physicians and other clinicians to record clinical progress notes and certain laboratory reports and provides a decision tree to assist them in certain situations with the selection of appropriate billing codes. BabySteps is in the process of moving from physical servers to a cloud-based application known as the “BabySteps Cloud,” and is currently deployed in over 225 Mednax NICUs. 
 •Clinical Data Warehouse. BabySteps enables our affiliated practices to capture a consistent set of clinical information about the patients we treat. We de-identify and transfer data from our electronic health records that reside in BabySteps to our “clinical data warehouse” that since inception has accumulated clinical information on more than 1.7 million patients and over 30 million patient days. With comprehensive reporting tools, our physicians can use this information to benchmark outcomes, enhance clinical decision-making and advance best practices at the bedside. Using a variety of clinical performance markers, our de-identified data warehouse also helps us track medication and procedure interactions, link treatments to outcomes and identify opportunities to enhance patient outcomes. 
 •Nextgen®. We have licensed the Nextgen Electronic Medical Record (“EMR”) and Electronic Patient Management (“EPM”) system for our affiliated office-based physicians and other clinicians to record clinical documentation related to their patients and to manage the revenue cycle for our office-based practices. This system can provide benefits to our office-based practices that are similar to what BabySteps provides to our neonatology practices, including decision trees to assist physicians with the selection of compliant billing codes, promotion of consistent documentation, and data for research and education. We are continuing the process of implementing EMR and EPM throughout our office-based practices. 
 •pMD Charge Capture. Our electronic charge capture system is used to appropriately code and bill for pediatric intensive care clinicians, hospitalist clinicians and other hospital providers. We also use administrative data derived from this system to drive quality assurance and quality improvement programs.
 •Mednax Continuing Education portal (CloudCME). In addition to providing continuing education, our web-based education platforms also function as important educational adjuncts to our affiliated physician groups, providing a rich source of ongoing medical education for our physicians and enabling physicians to discuss cases with one another through various clinical resources. 
 Our management information systems are also an integral element of the billing and reimbursement process. We maintain systems that provide for electronic data interchange with payors that accept electronic submissions, including electronic claims submission, insurance benefits verification and claims processing and remittance advice, which enable us to track numerous and diverse third-party payor relationships and payment methods. Our information systems provide scalability and flexibility as payor groups upgrade their payment and reimbursement systems. We continually seek improvements to our systems to expedite the overall process, streamline information gathering from our clinical systems and improve efficiencies in the reimbursement process.
 We maintain additional information systems designed to improve operating efficiencies of our affiliated practice groups, reduce physicians’ paperwork requirements and facilitate interaction among our affiliated physicians and their colleagues regarding patient care issues. Following the acquisition of a physician practice group, we implement systematic procedures to improve the acquired group’s operating and financial performance. One of our first steps is to convert a newly acquired group to our broad-based management information system. We also maintain a database management system to assist our business development and recruiting departments to identify potential practice group acquisitions and physician candidates.

PHYSICIAN PRACTICE GROUP ADMINISTRATION
 We provide multiple administrative services to support the practice of medicine by our affiliated physicians and strive to improve operating efficiencies of our affiliated practice groups.
•Unit Management. A senior physician practicing medicine in each physician specialty or subspecialty practice that we manage acts as the medical director for that practice. Each medical director is responsible for the overall management of his or her practice, including staffing and scheduling, quality of care, professional discipline, utilization review, coordinating physician recruitment and monitoring of the financial success within the practice. Medical directors also serve as a liaison with hospital administration, other physicians and the community.
 •Staffing and Scheduling. We assist with staffing and scheduling physicians and advanced practice nurses within the units and practices that we manage. For example, each NICU is staffed by at least one specialist on site or available on call. We are responsible for managing and coordinating the process for the salaries and benefits paid and provided to our affiliated physicians and practitioners. In addition, we employ, compensate and manage all non-medical personnel for our affiliated physician groups. 
 •Recruiting and Credentialing. We have significant experience in locating, qualifying, recruiting and retaining experienced physicians. We maintain an extensive nationwide database of neonatologists, maternal-fetal medicine physicians, and other pediatric subspecialty physicians. Our medical directors and physician leaders play a central role in the recruiting and interviewing process before candidates are introduced to other practice group physicians and hospital administrators. We verify the credentials, licenses and references of all prospective affiliated physician candidates. In addition to our database of physicians, we recruit nationally through trade advertising, referrals from our affiliated physicians and attendance at conferences. 
 •Billing, Collection and Reimbursement. We assume responsibility for assisting our affiliated physicians with contracting with third-party payors. We are responsible for billing, collection and reimbursement for services rendered by our affiliated physicians. In all instances, however, we do not assume responsibility for charges relating to services provided by hospitals or other physicians with whom we collaborate. Such charges are separately billed and collected by the hospitals or other physicians. We provide our affiliated physicians and other clinicians with a training curriculum that emphasizes detailed documentation of and compliant coding protocols for all procedures performed and services provided, and we provide comprehensive internal auditing processes, all of which are designed to achieve compliant coding, billing and collection of revenue for physician services. Generally, our billing and collection operations are conducted from our business offices located across the United States and in Puerto Rico, as well as our corporate offices.
 •Risk Management. We maintain a risk management program focused on reducing risk, including the identification and communication of potential risk areas to our medical affairs staff. We maintain professional liability coverage for our national group of affiliated healthcare professionals. Through our risk management and medical affairs staff, we conduct risk management programs for loss prevention and early intervention in order to prevent or minimize professional liability claims.
 •Compliance. We provide a multi-faceted compliance program that is designed to assist our affiliated practice groups in understanding and complying with the increasingly complex laws, rules and regulations that govern the provision of healthcare services. 
 •Other Services. We also provide management information systems, facilities management, legal support, marketing support and other services to our affiliated physicians and affiliated practice groups.
 RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR PARTNERS
 Our business model, which has been influenced by the direct contact and daily interaction that our affiliated physicians have with their patients, emphasizes a patient-focused clinical approach that addresses the needs of our

various “partners,” including hospitals, third-party payors, referring and collaborating physicians, affiliated physicians and, most importantly, our patients.
Hospitals and Other Customers
 Our relationships with our hospital partners and other customers are critical to our operations. Hospitals control access to their units and operating rooms through the awarding of contracts and hospital privileges. We have been retained by approximately 430 hospitals to staff and manage clinical activities within specific hospital-based units and other departments. Our affiliated physicians are important components of obstetric, pediatric and surgical services provided at hospitals. Our hospital-based focus enhances our relationships with hospitals and creates opportunities for our affiliated physicians to provide patient care in other areas of the hospital. For example, our physicians may provide care in emergency rooms, nurseries, intensive care units and other departments where access to specialized obstetric and pediatric care may be critical. Our hospital partners benefit from our expertise in managing critical care units and other settings staffed with physician specialists, including managing variable admission rates, operating costs, complex reimbursement systems and other administrative burdens. We work with our hospital partners to enhance their reputation and market our services to referring physicians within the communities served by those hospitals. In addition, our affiliated physicians work with our hospital partners to develop integrated services programs for solutions within the services we provide. Integrated programs provide our hospital partners and us with incremental growth and result in a broader spectrum of care across our specialties and permit us to extend our patient service lines into our existing markets. Our relationships with our hospital partners are continually evolving with the goal of being viewed by them as a solutions provider across all of our specialties.
 Under our contracts with hospitals, we have the responsibility to manage, in many cases exclusively, the provision of physician services for hospital-based units, such as NICUs, and other hospital settings. We typically are responsible for billing patients and third-party payors for services rendered by our affiliated physicians separately from other related charges billed by the hospital or other physicians to the same payors. Some of our hospital contracts require hospitals to pay us administrative fees. Some contracts provide for fees if the hospital does not generate sufficient patient volume in order to guarantee that we receive a specified minimum revenue level. We also receive fees from hospitals for administrative services performed by our affiliated physicians providing medical director services at the hospital. Administrative fees accounted for approximately 12.6% of our net revenue during 2021. Some of our contracts with hospitals require us to indemnify them and their affiliates for losses resulting from the negligence of our affiliated physicians. Our hospital contracts typically have terms of one to three years which can be terminated without cause by either party upon prior written notice, and renew automatically for additional terms of one to three years unless terminated early by any party. While we have in most cases been able to renew these arrangements, hospitals may cancel or not renew our arrangements, or reduce or eliminate our administrative fees in the future.
 Third-Party Payors
 Our relationships with government-sponsored or funded healthcare programs (“GHC Programs”), including Medicaid, and with managed care organizations and commercial health insurance payors are vital to our business. We seek to maintain professional working relationships with our third-party payors, streamline the administrative process of billing and collection, and assist our patients and their families in understanding their health insurance coverage and any balances due for co-payments, co-insurance, deductibles or benefit limitations. In addition, through our quality initiatives and continuing research and education efforts, we have sought to enhance clinical care provided to patients, which we believe benefits third-party payors by contributing to improved patient outcomes and reduced long-term health system costs.
 We receive compensation for professional services provided by our affiliated physicians to patients based upon rates for specific services provided, principally from third-party payors. Our billed charges are substantially the same for all parties in a particular geographic area, regardless of the party responsible for paying the bill for our services, but the payments we receive vary among payors. A significant portion of our net revenue is received from GHC Programs, principally state Medicaid programs.

Medicaid programs, which are jointly funded by the federal government and state governments, pay for medical and health-related services for certain categories of individuals and families generally who have low incomes or disabilities. Medicaid programs can be either standard fee-for-service payment programs or managed care programs

in which states have contracted with health insurance companies to run local or state-wide health plans with features similar to health maintenance organizations. Our compensation rates under standard fee-for-service Medicaid programs are established by state governments and are not negotiated. Although Medicaid rates vary across the states, these rates are generally much lower in comparison to private-sector health plan rates. Rates under Medicaid managed care programs typically are negotiated but are also generally much lower in comparison to private-sector health plan rates.

The Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) allows states to expand their Medicaid programs to enroll more individuals through federal payments that fund most of the cost of increasing the Medicaid eligibility income limit from a state’s historical eligibility levels to 133% of the federal poverty level. As of December 31, 2021, 38 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid eligibility to cover this additional low income patient population (including states that have adopted but not yet implemented expansion and those that are using an alternative approach to eligibility expansion) and other states are considering such expansion. All of the states in which we operate, however, already cover children in the first year of life and pregnant women if their household income is at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, and some states offer expanded coverage, with state eligibility thresholds that may range from 133% to 400% of the federal poverty level based on a combination of federal mandates and voluntary state expansions. In light of changes to the ACA, some of these states may eliminate, reduce or otherwise modify expanded enrollment eligibility. See Item 1A. Risk Factors ─ “State budgetary constraints and the uncertainty over the future Medicaid expansion could have an adverse effect on our reimbursement from Medicaid programs” and “Potential healthcare reform efforts may have a significant effect on our business.”
 
In order to participate in government programs, we and our affiliated practices must comply with stringent and often complex standards, including enrollment and reimbursement requirements. Different states also impose varying standards for their Medicaid programs. See “Government Regulation—Government Regulatory Requirements.”
 We also receive compensation pursuant to contracts with commercial payors that offer a wide variety of health insurance products, such as health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and exclusive provider organizations that are subject to various state laws and regulations, as well as employer-sponsored coverage subject to federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) requirements. We seek to secure mutually agreeable contracts with payors that enable our affiliated physicians to be listed as in-network participants within the payors’ provider networks. We generally contract with commercial payors through our affiliated professional contractors. Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, the terms, conditions and compensation rates of our contracts with commercial third-party payors are negotiated and often vary across markets and among payors. In some cases, we contract with organizations that establish and maintain provider networks and then rent or lease such networks to the actual payor. Our contracts with commercial payors typically provide for discounted fee-for-service arrangements. Our contracts with commercial payors typically also grant each party the right to terminate the contracts without cause upon prior written notice and various notice periods.
If we do not have a contractual relationship with a health insurance payor, we generally bill the payor our full billed charges. If payment is less than billed charges, we bill the balance to the patient, subject to federal and state laws regulating such billing, which Congress or states may continue to enact. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Congress or states have, and may continue to, enact laws restricting the amount out-of-network providers of services can charge and recover for such services.” In addition, these contracts generally give commercial payors the right to audit our billings and related reimbursements for professional and other services provided by or through our affiliated physicians.
 Although we maintain standard billing and collections procedures with appropriate discounts for prompt payment, we also provide discounts in certain hardship situations where patients and their families do not have financial resources necessary to pay the amount due for services rendered. Any amounts written-off are based on the specific facts and circumstances related to each individual patient account.
 Referring and Collaborating Physicians
 Our relationships with our referring and collaborating physicians are critical to our success. Our affiliated physicians seek to establish and maintain professional relationships with referring physicians in the communities

where they practice. Because patient volumes in our NICUs are based in part on referrals from other physicians, particularly obstetricians, it is important that we are responsive to the needs of referring physicians in the communities in which we operate. We believe that our community presence, through our hospital coverage and outpatient clinics, assists referring obstetricians, office-based pediatricians and family physicians with their practices. Our affiliated physicians are able to provide comprehensive maternal-fetal, newborn and pediatric subspecialty care to patients using the latest advances in methodologies, supporting the local referring physician community with 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week on-site or on-call coverage.
 Affiliated Physicians and Practice Groups
 Our relationships with our affiliated physicians are important. Our affiliated physicians are organized in traditional practice group structures. In accordance with applicable state laws, our affiliated practice groups are responsible for the provision of medical care to patients. Our affiliated practice groups are separate legal entities organized under state law as business corporations or professional associations, professional corporations, limited liability companies and partnerships, which we sometimes refer to as our “affiliated professional contractors”. Each of our affiliated professional contractors is owned by a licensed physician affiliated with the Company through employment or another contractual relationship. Our national infrastructure enables more effective and efficient sharing of new discoveries and clinical outcomes data, including best demonstrated processes, access to our sophisticated information systems, clinical research and education.
Our business corporations and affiliated professional contractors employ or contract with physicians to provide clinical services in certain states and Puerto Rico. In most of our affiliated practice groups, each physician has entered into an employment agreement with us or one of our affiliated professional contractors providing for a base salary and incentive bonus eligibility and typically having a term of three to five years. We are typically responsible for billing patients and third-party payors for services rendered by our affiliated physicians and, with respect to services provided in a hospital, separately from other charges billed by hospitals to the same payors. Each physician must hold a valid license to practice medicine in the state in which he or she provides patient care and must become a member of the medical staff, with appropriate clinical privileges, at each hospital at which he or she practices. Substantially all the physicians employed by us or our affiliated professional contractors have agreed not to compete within a specified geographic area during employment and for a certain period after termination of employment. Although we believe that the non-competition covenants of our affiliated physicians are reasonable in scope and duration and therefore enforceable under applicable state laws, we cannot predict whether a court or arbitration panel would enforce these covenants in any particular case. Our hospital contracts also typically require that we and the physicians performing services maintain minimum levels of professional and general liability insurance. We negotiate those policies and contract and pay the premiums for such insurance on behalf of the physicians.
 Each of our affiliated professional contractors has entered into a comprehensive management agreement with a subsidiary of Mednax as the manager. Under the terms of these management agreements, and subject to state laws and other regulations, the manager is typically paid for its services based on the performance of the applicable practice group. See “Government Regulation—Fee Splitting; Corporate Practice of Medicine.”
 COMPETITION
 The physician services industry is highly fragmented. Competition in our business is generally based upon a number of factors, including reputation, experience and level of care and our affiliated physicians’ ability to provide cost-effective, quality clinical care. The nature of competition for our hospital-based practices differs significantly from competition for our office-based practices. Our hospital-based practices compete nationally with other health services companies and physician groups for hospital contracts and qualified physicians. In some instances, our hospital-based physicians also compete on a regional or local basis. For example, our neonatologists compete for referrals from local physicians and transports from surrounding hospitals. Our office-based practices, such as maternal-fetal medicine and pediatric cardiology, compete for patients with office-based practices in those subspecialties.
Hospitals control access to their NICUs and operating rooms by awarding contracts and hospital clinical privileges, and our relationships with our hospital partners are critical to our operations. Because our operations consist primarily of physician services provided within hospital-based units, we compete with others for contracts with

hospitals to provide services. We also compete with hospitals themselves to provide such services. Hospitals may employ neonatologists directly or contract with other physician groups to provide services either on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. A hospital not otherwise competing with us may begin to do so by opening a new NICU or operating facility, expanding the capacity of an existing NICU, adding operating room suites or, in the case of neonatal services, upgrading the level of its existing NICU. If the hospital chooses to do so, it may award the contract to operate the relevant facility to a competing group or company from within or outside the surrounding community. Our contracts with hospitals generally provide that they may be terminated without cause upon prior written notice.
The healthcare industry is highly competitive. Companies in other segments of the industry as well as healthcare-focused and other private equity firms, some of which have financial and other resources greater than ours, may become competitors in providing neonatal, maternal-fetal and other pediatric subspecialty care.
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 The healthcare industry is governed by a framework of federal and state laws, rules and regulations that are extensive and complex and for which, in many cases, the industry has the benefit of only limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. The resources and costs required to comply with these laws, rules and regulations are high. If we or one of our affiliated practice groups or service businesses is found to have violated these laws, rules or regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected. The ACA made numerous changes that have reshaped the United States healthcare delivery system. Further healthcare reform continues to attract significant legislative and administrative interest, legal challenges, regulatory and compliance requirements, new approaches and public attention that create uncertainty and the potential for additional changes. Healthcare reform implementation, additional legislation or regulations, and other changes in government policy or regulation may affect our reimbursement, restrict our existing operations, limit the expansion of our business or impose additional compliance requirements and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. See Item 1A. Risk Factors ─ “Potential healthcare reform efforts may have a significant effect on our business.” Additional changes at the state level, including changes in Medicaid Program administration, eligibility and coverage, as well as changes in the regulatory framework governing the provision of telemedicine services, and other legal developments, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.
Licensing and Certification

Each state imposes licensing requirements on individual physicians and clinical professionals, and on facilities operated or utilized by healthcare companies like us. Many states require regulatory approval, including certificates of need, before establishing certain types of healthcare facilities, offering certain services or expending amounts in excess of statutory thresholds for healthcare equipment, facilities or programs. We and our affiliated physicians are also required to meet applicable Medicare supplier requirements under federal laws, rules and regulations and Medicaid provider requirements under federal and state laws, rules and regulations.
Fee Splitting; Corporate Practice of Medicine
 Many states have laws that prohibit business corporations, such as Mednax, from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by physicians, or engaging in certain arrangements, such as fee splitting, with physicians. In light of these restrictions, we operate by maintaining long-term management contracts through our subsidiaries with affiliated professional contractors, which employ or contract with physicians to provide professional medical services. Under these arrangements, our manager subsidiaries perform only non-medical administrative services, do not represent that they offer medical services and do not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians and other licensed health professionals employed by the affiliated professional contractors. In states where fee splitting with a business corporation or manager is prohibited, the fees that are received from the affiliated professional contractors have been established on a basis that we believe complies with applicable laws. Although the relevant laws in these states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation, we believe that we are in compliance with applicable state laws in relation to the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting. However, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our affiliated physicians, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we or our manager subsidiaries are engaged in the

corporate practice of medicine or that the contractual arrangements with the affiliated professional contractors constitute unlawful fee splitting, in which case we or our affiliated physicians could be subject to administrative, civil or criminal remedies or penalties, the contracts could be found to be legally invalid and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements with our affiliated professional contractors.
Fraud and Abuse Provisions
 Existing federal laws, as well as similar state laws, governing Medicare, Medicaid, other GHC Programs and other non-governmental arrangements and interactions, impose a variety of fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare companies like us. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”), the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (“CMS”), and various state agencies.
Federal and state fraud and abuse laws apply to and affect our financial relationships and other ordinary and common business interactions with hospitals, referring physicians and other healthcare entities. In particular, the federal anti-kickback statute makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration, in cash or in kind, in return for either referring items or services for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a GHC Program or purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or ordering of any service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a GHC Program. In addition, the federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” is a strict liability statute that prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity for certain “designated health services” payable by Medicare if the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship with that entity, unless an exception applies. The entity is further prohibited from billing the Medicare program for designated health services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. Further, the Stark Law, through the addition of section 1903(s) to the Social Security Act, prohibits the federal government from making federal financial participation payments to state Medicaid programs for designated health services furnished as a result of a referral that would violate the Stark Law if Medicare “covered the service to the same extent and under the same conditions” as the state Medicaid Program. The DOJ and several state agencies have successfully argued that Section 1903(s) expands the Stark Law to Medicaid-covered claims, even absent a separate state self-referral law prohibiting the same conduct. These laws have been broadly interpreted by federal courts and agencies, and potentially subject many healthcare business arrangements to government investigation, enforcement and prosecution, which can be costly and time consuming. Additionally, many of the states in which we operate also have similar anti-kickback and self-referral laws that apply to our government and non-government business, including in some cases, to patient self-pay services.
 Violations of these laws are punishable by substantial penalties and other remedies, including monetary fines, civil penalties, administrative remedies, criminal sanctions (in the case of the federal anti-kickback statute and certain state anti-kickback laws), exclusion from participation in GHC Programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws. The government may also assert that a claim to a GHC Program for covered items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”).
 There are a variety of other types of federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws authorizing the imposition of criminal, civil and administrative penalties for submitting false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to GHC Programs. These laws include the federal civil FCA, which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims to GHC Programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE (the program for military dependents and retirees), the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and insurance plans purchased through the ACA insurance exchanges where payments include federal funds. The FCA also makes the knowing retention of an identified overpayment from a GHC Program a separate basis for FCA liability. Substantial civil fines and treble damages, along with other remedies, including exclusion from GHC Programs, can be imposed for violating the FCA. Furthermore, the FCA does not require that the individual or company that presented or caused to be presented an allegedly false claim have actual knowledge of its falsity. The statute applies where the individual or company acted in “reckless disregard” or in “deliberate ignorance” of the truth or falsity of the claim. The FCA includes “whistleblower” provisions that permit private citizens to sue a claimant on behalf of the government and share in the amounts recovered under the law. In recent years, many cases have been brought against healthcare companies by the government and by “whistleblowers,” which have resulted in judgments and settlements involving substantial

payments to the government by the companies involved. The cost to defend against allegations, even when the government declines to intervene, can be substantial.
 In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes substantial civil monetary penalties against a person or entity that engages in other prohibited activities, such as presenting or causing to be presented a claim to a GHC Program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or for a claim that is false or fraudulent, or providing remuneration to a GHC Program beneficiary that the person or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a provider or supplier. Regulators also have the authority to exclude individuals and entities from participation in GHC Programs under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law.
 The civil and administrative false claims statutes are being applied in a broad range of circumstances. For example, claims for services that are medically unnecessary or fail to meet applicable coverage standards may, under certain circumstances, violate these statutes. Claims for services that were induced by kickbacks and Stark Law violations may also form the basis for FCA liability. Many of the laws and regulations referenced above can be used in conjunction with each other.
 If we or our affiliated professional contractors were excluded from participation in any GHC Programs, not only would we be prohibited from submitting claims for reimbursement under such programs, but we also would be unable to contract with other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, to provide services to them. It could also adversely affect our or our affiliated professional contractors’ ability to contract with, or obtain payment from, non-governmental payors.
 Although we intend to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws, many of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us, including those relating to billing and those relating to financial relationships with physicians and hospitals, are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied by prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authorities in ways that we cannot predict. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws. If there is a determination by government authorities that we have not complied with any of these laws, rules and regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected. See “Government Investigations.” Additionally, federal and state fraud and abuse laws, rules and regulations are not static and amendments, clarifications, revisions, or other modifications to these laws may occur from time to time. For instance, on December 2, 2020, both CMS and the OIG published final rules substantially modifying the anti-kickback statute, Civil Monetary Penalty Law, and the Stark Law regulations to foster arrangements that would promote care coordination, advance the delivery of value-based care, and protect consumers from harms caused by fraud and abuse. Changes reflected in OIG and CMS’s final rules could affect our operations and may cause us to modify certain arrangements, transactions, or other financial relationships.
 Government Regulatory Requirements
In order to participate in the Medicare program and in the various state Medicaid programs, we and our affiliated physician practices must comply with stringent and often complex regulatory requirements. Moreover, different states impose varying standards for their Medicaid programs. While our compliance program requires that we and our affiliated physician practices adhere to the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the government programs in which we participate, our failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Government Regulation—Fraud and Abuse Provisions,” “Government Regulation—Compliance Program,” “Government Investigations” and “Other Legal Proceedings,” and Item 1A. Risk Factors — “Government-funded programs, private insurers or state laws and regulations may limit, reduce or make retroactive adjustments to reimbursement amounts or rates,” “We may become subject to billing investigations by federal and state government authorities and private insurers” and “The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and government authorities may determine that we have failed to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations.”
 In addition, GHC Programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, manual guidance, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of

providing services and the timing of payments to providers. Moreover, because GHC Programs generally provide for reimbursement on a fee-schedule, per-service or per-discharge basis rather than on a charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenue through increases in the amount we charge for our services. To the extent our costs increase, we may not be able to recover our increased costs from these programs, and cost containment measures and market changes in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted our ability to recover or shift these increased costs to non-governmental payors. In addition, the health care industry is increasing the use of value-based reimbursement methodologies and accordingly, our reimbursement may be dependent upon our ability to achieve quality targets that change year over year. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Potential healthcare reform efforts may have a significant effect on our business.” In attempts to limit federal and state spending, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of proposals to limit or reduce Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for various services. Our business may be significantly and adversely affected by any such changes in reimbursement policies and other legislative initiatives aimed at reducing healthcare costs associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other GHC Programs.
Our business also could be adversely affected by reductions in or limitations of funding of GHC Programs or restrictions on or elimination of coverage for certain individuals or treatments under these programs.
 Antitrust
 The healthcare industry is subject to close antitrust scrutiny. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and state Attorneys General all actively review and, in some cases, take enforcement action against business conduct and acquisitions in the healthcare industry. Private parties harmed by alleged anticompetitive conduct can also bring antitrust suits. Violations of antitrust laws may be punishable by substantial penalties, including significant monetary fines, civil penalties, criminal sanctions, consent decrees and injunctions prohibiting certain activities or requiring divestiture or discontinuance of business operations. Any of these penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.
HIPAA and Other Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Laws
 Numerous federal and state laws, rules and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, security and confidentiality of personal information. For example, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”) impose requirements to protect the privacy and security of protected health information (“PHI”) and to provide notification in the event of a breach of PHI. Violations of HIPAA are punishable by civil money penalties and, in some cases, criminal penalties and imprisonment. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”), which is responsible for enforcing HIPAA, also may enter into resolution agreements requiring the payment of a civil money penalty and/or the establishment of a corrective action plan to address violations of HIPAA. As part of our business operations, including in connection with medical record keeping, third-party billing, research and other services, we and our affiliated physician practices collect and maintain PHI regarding patients, which subjects us to compliance with HIPAA requirements.
 Pursuant to HIPAA, HHS has adopted privacy regulations, known as the privacy rule, to govern the use and disclosure of PHI (the “Privacy Rule”). The Privacy Rule applies to “Covered Entities,” which are health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers that engage in standardized transactions under HIPAA, and, as discussed further below, “Business Associates,” which are entities that perform functions or services for or on behalf of Covered Entities that involve the use or disclosure of PHI. The term “Business Associate” also includes “Subcontractors,” which means any entity to which a Business Associate delegates any function, activity or service, other than in the capacity of a member of that Business Associate’s workforce. PHI is broadly defined as any individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form, including electronic, paper or oral. As a general rule, a Covered Entity or Business Associate may not use or disclose PHI except as permitted under the Privacy Rule. We have implemented privacy policies and procedures, including training programs, and signed Business Associate Agreements, designed to comply with the requirements set forth in the Privacy Rule, as amended to reflect changes required by HITECH, as discussed further below.

HHS has also adopted data security regulations (the “Security Rule”) that require Covered Entities (including health care providers) and Business Associates to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of PHI that is electronically created, received, maintained or transmitted (such as between us and our affiliated practices). We have implemented security policies, procedures and systems, including training programs, designed to comply with the requirements set forth in the Security Rule.
 In addition, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Among other changes to the laws governing PHI, HITECH required OCR to strengthen and expand HIPAA requirements, increase penalties for violations, give patients new rights to restrict uses and disclosures of their PHI, and impose a number of privacy and security requirements directly on Business Associates. A Covered Entity can also be held liable for violations of HIPAA resulting from the acts or omissions of any Business Associate acting as its agent.
Under HIPAA, as amended by regulations promulgated pursuant to HITECH, Covered Entities are required to report any unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI that meets the definition of a breach to affected individuals, HHS and, depending on the number of affected individuals, the media for the affected market. In addition, HIPAA requires that Business Associates report breaches to their Covered Entity customers. HITECH further authorizes state Attorneys General to bring civil actions in response to violations of HIPAA that threaten the privacy of state residents. We have adopted breach notification policies and procedures designed to comply with the applicable requirements set forth in HIPAA.
 HIPAA establishes a federal “floor” with respect to privacy, security, and breach notification requirements and does not supersede any state laws insofar as they are broader or more stringent than HIPAA. Numerous state and certain other federal laws protect the confidentiality of health information and other personal information, including but not limited to state medical privacy laws, state laws protecting personal information, state data breach notification laws, state genetic privacy laws, human subjects research laws and federal and state consumer protection laws. These additional federal and state privacy and security-related laws may be more restrictive than HIPAA and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Act to initiate enforcement actions in response to alleged privacy violations and data breaches. California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. California recently amended and expanded CCPA through another ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), passed on November 3, 2020. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to the CPRA by the California legislature or how it will be interpreted. In addition to California, other states have strengthened their data security laws and others are indicated their intention to do so as well. A bill introduced in the New York Senate on October 28, 2020, the “It’s Your Data Act” (IYDA), would modify New York’s civil rights and general business laws to expand the current right of privacy as well as create a series of consumer rights and business obligations concerning the collection, storage, and use of a consumer’s personal information. Violations could result in civil and criminal liability. It is expected that additional state legislatures will introduce stronger data privacy protections this year. In addition, industry groups such as the payment card industry have developed self-regulatory guidelines for privacy and data security that are more stringent than HIPAA. In order to accept payments from payment cards, merchants must use payment card processing applications that have been validated under the Payment Application Data Security Standard (“PA-DSS”), and complete a self-assessment questionnaire that complies with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”). Failure to comply with PA-DSS and PCI-DSS may result in fines and penalties imposed by payment card brands, and/or termination of the merchant’s relationship with the bank it relies on to process payment card payments.
 
These requirements are also subject to change. Compliance with new privacy, security, and breach notification laws, regulations, requirements and self-regulatory guidelines may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example, changes to HIPAA promulgated pursuant to HITECH further restricted our ability to collect, disclose and use PHI and imposed additional compliance requirements on us.

Although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage intended to cover cyber liability and certain other privacy and security breach-related claims, we cannot ensure that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable to us. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for cyber liability and certain other privacy and security breach-related claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.
 HIPAA Transaction Requirements
 In addition to privacy, security, and breach notifications requirements, HIPAA establishes uniform electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers must use for electronic healthcare transactions. For example, claims for reimbursement that are transmitted electronically to third-party payors must comply with specific formatting standards, and these standards apply whether the payor is a government or a private entity. We report medical diagnoses under International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition (“ICD-10”). If claims are not reported properly under ICD-10 due to technical or coding errors or other implementation issues involving systems, including ours and those of our third-party payors, there can be a delay in the processing and payment of such claims, or a denial of such claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.
Compliance Program
We maintain a compliance program that includes the OIG’s seven established elements of an effective program and which reflects our commitment to complying with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business and that meets our ethical obligations in conducting our business (the “Compliance Program”). We believe our Compliance Program provides a solid framework to meet this commitment and our obligations as a provider of healthcare services, including:
•a Chief Compliance Officer who reports to the Board of Directors on a regular basis;
 •a Compliance Committee consisting of our senior executives;
 •a formal internal audit function, including a Senior Director of Internal Audit who reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis;
 •our Code of Conduct, which is applicable to our employees, independent contractors, officers and directors;
 •our Code of Professional Conduct – Finance, which is applicable to our finance personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer;
 •a disclosure program that includes a mechanism to enable individuals to disclose on a confidential or anonymous basis to the Chief Compliance Officer or any person who is not in the disclosing individual’s chain of command, issues or questions believed by the individual to be a potential violation of criminal, civil, or administrative laws or of company policies or procedures;
 •an organizational structure designed to integrate our compliance objectives into our corporate offices, regions and practices; and 
 •education, monitoring and corrective action programs designed to establish methods to promote the understanding of our Compliance Program and adherence to its requirements.
 The foundation of our Compliance Program is our Code of Conduct, which is intended to be a comprehensive statement of the ethical and legal standards governing the daily activities of our employees, affiliated professionals, independent contractors, officers and directors. All of our personnel are required to abide by, and are given thorough education regarding, our Code of Conduct. In addition, all employees and affiliated professionals are expected to report incidents that they believe in good faith may be in violation of our Code of Conduct. We maintain a toll-free

helpline to permit individuals to report compliance concerns on an anonymous or confidential basis, if they elect to do so, and obtain answers to questions about our Code of Conduct. Our Compliance Program, including our Code of Conduct, is administered by our Chief Compliance Officer with oversight by our Chief Executive Officer, Compliance Committee and Board of Directors. Copies of our Code of Conduct and our Code of Professional Conduct – Finance are available on our website, www.Mednax.com. Our internet website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not incorporated into or deemed a part of this Form 10-K. Any amendments or waivers to our Code of Professional Conduct – Finance will be promptly disclosed on our website following the date of any such amendment or waiver.
GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS
 We expect that audits, inquiries and investigations from government authorities, agencies, contractors and payors will occur in the ordinary course of business. Such audits, inquiries and investigations and their ultimate resolutions, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.
OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
In the ordinary course of our business, we become involved in pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, most of which involve claims of medical malpractice related to medical services provided by our affiliated physicians. Our contracts with hospitals generally require us to indemnify them and their affiliates for losses resulting from the negligence of our affiliated physicians and other clinicians. We may also become subject to other lawsuits, including with payors or other counterparties that could involve large claims and significant defense costs. We believe, based upon a review of pending actions and proceedings, that the outcome of such legal actions and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. The outcome of such actions and proceedings, however, cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.

Although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage intended to cover professional liability and certain other claims, we cannot ensure that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable to us. With respect to professional liability risk, we self-insure a significant portion of this risk through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and certain other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. See “Professional and General Liability Coverage.”
 
PROFESSIONAL AND GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE
 We maintain professional and general liability insurance policies with third-party insurers generally on a claims-made basis, subject to deductibles, self-insured retention limits, policy aggregates, exclusions, and other restrictions, in accordance with standard industry practice. We believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate based upon our claims experience and the nature and risks of our business. However, we cannot predict whether any pending or future claim would be successful or, if successful, would not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.
Our business entails an inherent risk of claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians, clinicians and us. We contract and pay premiums for professional liability insurance that indemnifies us and our affiliated healthcare professionals generally on a claims-made basis for losses incurred related to medical malpractice litigation. Professional liability coverage is required in order for our affiliated physicians to maintain hospital privileges. Our self-insured retention under our professional liability insurance program is maintained primarily through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. We record estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements for our liabilities for self-insured retention amounts and claims incurred but not reported based on an actuarial valuation using historical loss information, claim emergence patterns and various actuarial assumptions. Liabilities for claims incurred but not reported are not discounted. Because many factors can affect historical and future loss patterns, the determination of an appropriate reserve involves complex, subjective judgment, and actual results may vary significantly from estimates. If the self-insured retention amounts and other amounts that we are actually required

to pay materially exceed the estimates that have been reserved, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially, adversely affected.
 
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
 We believe our affiliated physicians, other clinical professionals and administrative employees are key to our success. As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 2,400 practicing physicians affiliated with us, and we employed or contracted with approximately 2,275 other clinical professionals and approximately 2,725 other full-time and part-time employees. Our affiliated physicians and clinicians provide critical medical care through 20 women’s and children’s healthcare services across 38 states and Puerto Rico, providing care to the most vulnerable patient population in the country: expecting mothers and their newborns and children.

We believe that the success of our mission to “Take great care of the patient, every day and in every wayTM” is realized by the engagement and empowerment of our affiliated physicians, other clinicians and administrative employees. Our Chief Human Resources Officer ("CHRO") is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This includes the attraction, acquisition, development, engagement, compensation and retention of talent. Our CHRO reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and regularly engages with our board of directors and its compensation committee. Our Human Resources department is a core administrative support function of Mednax. Through its functional experts, our Human Resources team provides support, guidance and consultation in the areas of talent acquisition, employee wellness and safety programs, diversity, equity and inclusion, workplace policies and procedures, training and development and rewards strategies that include compensation, benefits and other rewards. It is the goal of the Human Resources department to support the needs of our organization and our workforce while serving as a trusted strategic partner to our management team.

We work together to make sound decisions for all of our operations teams and medical groups. Physicians spend years of their lives learning and training the science of medicine in order to bring their knowledge and skill to the bedside of a patient. It is an art, honed through repeated patient interactions, that allows any clinician to translate science into compassionate care for our patients. But healthcare is also our business, so we must also take great care of the business. This requires us to work every day to put tools into the hands of our affiliated physicians and other clinical professionals so they can deliver high quality care to our patients.
 
Training and Leadership Development
 
We are committed to the continued development of our people and believe in fostering great leaders. Our Training and Development team is committed to providing an environment that fosters both individual and organizational development. Through its various training and educational programs, the training and development team supports the organization’s commitment to excellence and its mission to “Take great care of the patient, every day and in every wayTM”. We make available a catalog of over 4,000 courses to all audiences across subjects including business skills, leadership and management, office productivity, health and wellness and personal development, among others. The courses are designed to develop great people who become great leaders that will ultimately shape a great company. Our training materials were enhanced with additional resources to support remote work environments required due to COVID-19.

One of the greatest predictors of success in our partnerships at the hospital and health system level is a high degree of strategic alignment between our clinical leadership and our partners. This requires that our clinicians have a skill set beyond just the practice of medicine.

Compliance Program and Training
 
Fundamental to our core values are people and a culture of integrity. Our Compliance Department is led by our Chief Compliance Officer. The Compliance Program is supported by a written Compliance Plan, which details the components, organizational structure and operational aspects of the Compliance Program. Although the Compliance Program is supported by numerous operational policies and procedures, there are some key elements that are critical to its success. These include a Compliance Committee; a written Code of Conduct; new hire and periodic compliance training for all employees; compliance reporting mechanisms; and periodic reports to our board of

directors. Annual participation in compliance trainings related to ethics, environment, health and safety, and emergency responses are at 100%.
 
Health and Well-Being
 
We care about the health and well-being of our affiliated clinicians, other clinical professionals and our administrative employees and their families and are committed to their health, safety and wellness. We support all of our colleagues in encouraging habits of wellness, increased awareness of factors and resources that contribute to overall well-being and inspire individuals to take responsibility for their own health. When individuals take great care of themselves, we can continue to take great care of our patients and take great care of our business.
   We provide all our colleagues access to an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”) that offers free and confidential assessments, short-term counseling, referrals, and follow-up services to employees who have personal and/or work-related problems. Our EAP addresses a broad and complex body of issues affecting mental and emotional well-being, such as alcohol and other substance abuse, stress, grief, family problems, and psychological disorders. EAP counselors also work in a consultative role with managers and supervisors to address employee and organizational challenges and needs. The EAP is designed to help our colleagues lead happier and more productive lives at home and at work. Our EAP services are available to all eligible employees, their spouses or domestic partners, dependent children, parents and parents-in-law. We encourage all of our employees and their family members to make full use of this resource which is designed to help maintain high employee productivity, health, and well-being in all aspects of life.

We have also partnered with the American Heart Association to provide heart healthy information and programs to our employees and encourage local participation in the AHA annual Heart Walk.
 
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we worked tirelessly to source and provide personal protective equipment for our patient facing employees. For employees who were and are not in direct clinical care, we pivoted to a remote work arrangement which continues today and will do so until such time as we can be assured that the physical work environment is safe for all team members from an infection prevention perspective.

Diversity and Inclusion
 
We strive to make diversity, equality and inclusion a priority and foster a culture of trust and respect where all employees have a sense of belonging. Diverse representation at all levels of our organization is of the utmost importance to our culture and our business. As of February 1, 2022, approximately 80% of our total headcount was female and over 40% of our total headcount identified as a person of color. Among our affiliated physicians and other clinical professionals, approximately 75% were female and over 35% identified as a person of color. Among the executive and senior executive level and manager group, over 40% were female and approximately 20% identified as a person of color. We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we will continue to focus on the hiring, advancement, and retention of both visibly and invisibly underrepresented populations.
Total Rewards: Compensation and Benefits
 
We value our colleagues’ contributions to our success and strive to provide all of our colleagues with a competitive and comprehensive total rewards package. This includes robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our affiliated physicians, other clinical professionals and administrative employees.
 
We take great care to ensure that our cash-based compensation packages are reflective of the market value for the work that our colleagues perform. We also understand that providing a comprehensive suite of employee benefits is essential to attracting, retaining and engaging world-class employees. Therefore, we regularly evaluate our benefit offerings to be sure we fully support our employees. In addition to base salaries, these offerings may include a combination of annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, adoption assistance, employee assistance programs, continuing education, among many others.

GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE


We provide physician services across 38 states and Puerto Rico. During 2021, approximately 62% of our net revenue was generated by operations in our five largest states. Our operations in Texas accounted for approximately 30% of our net revenue for the same period. Although we continue to seek to diversify the geographic scope of our operations, we may not be able to implement successfully or realize the expected benefits of any of these initiatives. Adverse changes or conditions affecting states in which our operations are concentrated, such as healthcare reforms, changes in laws, rules and regulations, reduced Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements, an increase in the income level required to qualify for government healthcare programs or government investigations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.
