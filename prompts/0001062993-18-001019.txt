ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Business Overview 
             We are a service and research company in the field of the regenerative medicine industry with a focus on cell therapy development and manufacturing for advanced medicinal products serving the regenerative medicine industry. In addition, we are focused on developing novel and proprietary cell therapy trans-differentiation technologies for the treatment of diabetes. 
             A large number of diseases continue without adequate conventional therapies. Cell therapy has a unique therapeutic effect as it is based on augmenting, repairing, replacing or regenerating organs and tissues - leveraging the human body's capacity to heal. It therefore holds the promise to be able to cure diseases that present both a major health care and economic burden, such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. But if the regenerative market is to realize its full potential, manufacturing and logistics need to be in place to ensure these products' safety, potency and consistency at economically sustainable costs. We have built up our long term strategy on this industry assessment. 
             Our vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities are being used to serve emerging technologies of cell therapy clients in such areas as cell-based cancer immunotherapies and neurodegenerative diseases and also to optimize our abilities to scale-up our licensed and proprietary technologies for clinical trials and eventual commercialization of our proposed diabetes treatment. Our hybrid business model of combining our own proprietary cell therapy trans-differentiation technologies for the treatment of diabetes and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing service business provides us with unique capabilities and supports our mission of accelerating the development and ultimate marketing of breakthrough life-improving medical treatments. 
             We seek to differentiate our company from other cell therapy companies by our Belgian-based CDMO subsidiary, MaSTherCell, and a world-wide network of Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMO) joint venture partners who have built a unique and fundamental base platform of know-how and expertise for manufacturing in a multitude of cell types. The goal is to industrialize cell therapy for fast, safe and cost-effective production in order to provide rapid therapies for any market around the world. Our strategy is to have all of our services compliant with GMP requirements, ensuring identity, purity, stability, potency and robustness of cell therapy products for clinical phase I, II, III through commercialization.

            MaSTherCell currently operates facilities qualified under cGMPs in Belgium. We acquired MaSTherCell in March 2015. Formed in 2011 as a spin-off from the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and starting operational activities in 2013, we believe that MaSTherCell has assembled a recognized team of experts and talents in the cell therapy industry and has attracted world-class customers. MaSTherCell is developing technologies for other cell therapy companies such as cell-based cancer immunotherapies and neurodegenerative diseases. Our vertical integration responds to the main challenges faced by most biotechnology companies such as cost of goods sold and logistics. 
             MaSTherCell has built its unique and disruptive value proposition by providing two types of services to its customers: (i) process and assay development and optimization services and (ii) current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) contract manufacturing services as practiced in Europe. These services offer a double advantage to MaSTherCells customers. First, customers can continue allocating their financial and human resources on their therapy offerings, while relying on a trusted partner for their production process development. Second, it allows customers to leverage MaSTherCell s expertise in cell therapy manufacturing and all related aspects. As the industry continues to mature and a growing number of cell therapy companies approach commercialization, we believe that MaSTherCell is well positioned to serve as an external manufacturing source for cell therapy companies. Additionally, all of these capabilities offered to third-parties will be mobilized for our internal development projects, allowing us to be in a position to bring new products to the patients faster and in a cost-effective way. 
             Our trans-differentiation technologies for treating diabetes, which we will refer to as our cellular therapy (CT) business, is based on a technology licensed by our Israeli Subsidiary that demonstrates the capacity to induce a shift in the developmental fate of cells from the liver and transdifferentiating them into pancreatic beta cell-like Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) cells for patients with Type 1 Diabetes. Moreover, those cells were found to be resistant to autoimmune attack and to produce insulin in a glucose-sensitive manner in relevant animal models which significantly broadens the potential of the technology for other therapeutics areas. Our trans-differentiation technology for diabetes is from the work of Prof. Sarah Ferber, our Chief Science Officer and a researcher at Tel Hashomer Medical Research Infrastructure and Services Ltd. (THM) in Israel. Our development plan calls for conducting additional preclinical safety and efficacy studies with respect to diabetes and other potential indications prior to initiating clinical trials. In parallel, we work on establishing the GMP manufacturing process which development is already accomplished. 
             We operate our CDMO and the CT businesses as two separate business segments. 
 CDMO Business 
 Industry Background 
             Companies developing cell therapies need to make a decision early on in their approach to the transition from the lab to the clinic regarding the manufacturing and production of the cells necessary for their respective treatments. Of the companies active in this market, only a small number have established their own GMP manufacturing facilities due to the high costs and expertise required to develop and maintain such production centers. In addition to the limitations imposed by limited number of trained personnel and high infrastructure/operational costs, the industry faces a need for custom innovative process development and manufacturing solutions. Due to the complexity and diversity of the industry, such solutions are often customized to the particular needs of the company and, accordingly, a multidisciplinary team of engineers, cell therapy experts, cGMP and regulatory experts is required. Such a unique group of experts can exist only in an organization that specializes in developing solutions and manufacturing cell therapies. 
             Companies can establish their own process and GMP manufacturing facility or engage a contract manufacturing organization for each step. A contract manufacturing organization (CMO), sometimes called a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), is an entity that serves other companies in the pharmaceutical industry on a contract basis to provide comprehensive services from cell therapy development through cell therapy manufacturing for and end-to-end solution. Due to the complexity, global outreach needs, redundancy and operational costs of manufacturing biologics and cell therapies, the CDMO business is expanding. With more than 854 companies in the field of the regenerative medicine worldwide (versus 580 in 2015) and 934 clinical trials underway by the end of the third quarter of 2017 (versus 486 in first quarter of 2015), we believe that the industry shows a rapid growth rate accompanied by a lack of sufficient GMP manufacturing capacities (Source: Informa, 2015 and 2018). Over recent years, advances in the field of regenerative medicine, including the growth of autologous CAR T-cell therapies, led to a significant increase in investment in the industry. As its name implies, the backbone of CAR T-cell therapy is T-cells, often called the workhorses of the immune system because of their critical role in orchestrating the immune response and killing cells infected by pathogens. The therapy requires drawing blood from patients and separating out the T-cells. Next, using a disarmed virus, the T-cells are genetically engineered to produce receptors on their surface called chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs. Treatments work by extracting a cancer patients T-cells, genetically modifying them outside the body to make them more effective at hunting down and killing tumors, and then re-injecting them into the patient. 
 -5-

            Two landmark U.S. FDA approvals in CAR T-cell therapy significantly impacted the cell therapy industry. In August 2017, Novartiss CAR T-cell therapy, Kymriah, was approved for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia for pediatric and young adult patients, making it the first cell-base immunotherapy to move across the finish line in the United States. Furthermore, after Gilead's acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc. for $12 billion in 2017, Kite Pharmas CAR T-cell therapy, Yescarta, was approved for adult patients with relapsed/refractory large B cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy (Source: Alliance for Regenerative Medicine). We believe that these are the most concrete step towards building confidence and support for the future potential approvals of many more cellular therapies that address a wide range of diseases. 
             The complexity of manufacturing individual cell therapy treatments poses a fundamental challenge for CAR T-cell therapy-based companies as they enter the field, potentially casting a spotlight on improved large-scale manufacturing processes such as MaSTherCell's. Manufacturing and delivery are more complex in CAR T than for a typical drug. In the U.S., only a few dozen specialized hospitals are currently qualified to provide CAR T treatments, which require retrieving, processing and then returning immune cells to the patient, as well as monitoring side effects. These factors provide real incentives for cell therapy companies to seek third-party partners, or contract manufacturers, who possess technical, manufacturing, and regulatory expertise in cell therapy development and manufacturing such as cell therapy CDMOs like MaSTherCell. 
             Our vertical integration of development and manufacturing and logistics services through MaSTherCell provide the basis for generating a recurring revenue stream, as well as carefully managing our fixed cost structure to maximize optionality and drive down production cost. We believe that operating our own manufacturing facility provides us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, will enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and will allow for better long-term margins. 
 MaSTherCells Business 
             Our Belgian-based subsidiary, MaSTherCell, is a CDMO specialized in cell therapy development for advanced therapeutically products. In the last decade, cell therapy medicinal products have gained significant importance, particularly in the fields of ex-vivo gene therapy and immunotherapy. While academic and industrial research has led scientific development in the sector, industrialization and manufacturing expertise remains insufficient. MaSTherCell plans to fill this gap by providing two types of services to its customers: (i) process and assay development services and (ii) current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) contract manufacturing services. These services offer a double advantage to MaSTherCell's customers. First, customers can continue allocating their financial and human resources on their product/therapy, while relying on a trusted partner for their process development/production. Second, it allows customers to benefit from MaSTherCell's expertise in cell therapy manufacturing and all related aspects. 
             MaSTherCell continues to invest in its manufacturing capabilities to offer a one-stop-shop service to its customers from pre-clinical up to commercial. This stems from the finding that these companies' processes have to be set up right from the start in order for them to obtain approved products that have the simplest possible process and with the lowest possible cost of goods sold (COGS). Our target customers are primarily cell therapy companies that are in clinical trials with the aim of accompanying them as their manufacturing and logistic partner once their product candidates reach commercial stage. 
 -6-

            We devote significant resources to process development and manufacturing in order to optimize the safety and efficacy of our future product candidates for our customers, as well as our cost of goods and time to market. This vertical integration of development, manufacturing and logistics services through MaSTherCell aims to provide the basis for generating a recurring revenue stream, as well as carefully managing our fixed cost structure, maximize optionality, and drive long-term cost of goods as low as possible. We believe that operating our own manufacturing facility provides us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, will enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and will allow for better long-term margins. 
 
            MaSTherCell continues to invest resources to maintain best practices in quality service, quality control, quality assurance and permanent staff training to uphold the highest standards to serve its customers. MaSTherCell has built-up a team of more than 92 industry experts dedicated to support process development and manufacturing efforts in a fast, safe and cost-effective way. MaSTherCell's strategy is to build long term relationships with its customers in order to help them bring highly potent cell therapy products faster to the market and in cost-effective ways. To provide these services, MaSTherCell relies on a team of dedicated experts both from academic and industry backgrounds. It operates through state-of-the-art facilities located approximately 40 minutes from Brussels, which have received the final cGMP manufacturing authorization from the Belgian Drug Agency (AFMPS) in September 2013 and a renewal in October 2017 for cell-based therapies manufacturing that was extended to gene therapies. 
 Third Party Investment in MaSTherCell 
             On November 15, 2017, we, MaSTherCell and the Belgian Sovereign Funds Société Fédérale de Participations et d'Investissement (SFPI) entered into a Subscription and Shareholders Agreement (the Agreement) pursuant to which SFPI completed an equity investment in MaSTherCell in the aggregate amount of €5million (approximately $5.9 million), for approximately 16.7% of MaSTherCell. The equity investment included the conversion of the then outstanding loan of €1 million (approximately $1.1 million) plus accrued interest in the approximate amount of €70 thousand (approximately $77,000), previously made by SFPI to MaSTherCell (the Loan Amount). 
             Under the Agreement, an initial subscription amount of €2 million (approximately $2.3 million) has been paid and the outstanding Loan Amount was converted. The balance of approximately €2 million is payable as needed by MaSTherCell and called in by the board of directors of MaSTherCell. The proceeds of the investment will be used to expand MaSTherCells facilities in Belgium by the addition of five new cGMP manufacturing cleanrooms. MaSTherCell expects that this expansion will position it as the European hub for the Companys continental activities and strengthen its leading position in cell and gene manufacturing. The state-of-the-art design enables MaSTherCell to offer full flexibility for production and process development. 
             Under the Agreement, SFPI will be represented by one board member of the five board members of MaSTherCell. In addition, SFPI is entitled to designate one independent board member to the MaSTherCell board who is acceptable to us. The Agreement provides that, under certain specified circumstances where MaSTherCell breaches the terms of the Agreement, SFPI is entitled to put its equity interest in MaSTherCell to us at a price equal to the subscription price paid by SFPI, plus a specified annual premium ranging from 10% to 25%, depending on the year following the subscription in which the put is exercised. If the Company elects to terminate the Agreement before its scheduled term of seven years (or to not renew the agreement upon its scheduled termination), SFPI is entitled to put its MaSTherCell equity interest to us at fair market value (as determined by SFPI and the Company). Additionally, at any time during the first three years following the investment, SFPI is entitled to exchange its equity interest in MaSTherCell into shares of common stock, at a rate equal to the subscription price paid by SFPI divided by $6.24 (subject to adjustment for certain capital events, such as stock splits).

            Following the SFPI investment in MaSTherCell, in November 2017, MaSTherCell announced the expansion by 600m² of its facility in Belgium with a dedicated, late-stage clinical and commercial cGMP unit, anticipated to be operational by the fourth quarter of 2018. This new expansion will enable MaSTherCell to augment its commercial capabilities in Europe with five state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing units and extended GMP-accredited quality control (QC) laboratories. 
 Our Growth Strategy 
             In light of the globalization of the industry in general and the therapeutics industry in particular, adding to that the high cost of reaching market, developers of cell therapies see themselves as global organizations and build their models on global markets. As cell therapies are based on living cells, they are limited in their ability to be centrally manufactured. An additional challenge for globalization is the fact that the regulatory requirements for the therapies is not harmonized between jurisdictions, presenting additional operational challenges. 
             Orgenesis is building up a leading international CDMO focusing on cell manufacturing and a strong pipeline of regenerative medicine products. Capitalizing on MaSTherCells experience and expertise, we have established collaboration agreement for the CDMO activity with the main focus, initially, in South Korea and Israel. The goal is a potential 50/50 partnership, which allows us the potential of full ownership in the future. 
             We have leveraged the recognized quality expertise and experience in cell process development and manufacturing of MaSTherCell, and our international joint ventures, in Israel and Korea, to build a global CDMO in the cell therapy development and manufacturing area. We believe that cell therapy companies need to be global in order to truly succeed. We target the international manufacturing market as a key priority through joint-venture agreements that provide development capabilities, along with manufacturing facilities and experienced staff.
             The main revenue drivers of our growth strategy on a global reach are the number of batches and the number of patients per manufacturing batch. These parameters vary along the development cycle of the new treatments (starting from as few as 20 patients in Phase I to thousands of patients when reaching commercialization). When a client reaches the commercial stage, their demand for manufacturing substantially increases, while barriers preventing the client from switching to another manufacturing organization remain extremely high. The difficulty in transferring CDMOs is a function of the tech transfer of such complex manufacturing processes being extremely lengthy, requiring many months of training of highly specialized employees, while also possibly requiring new regulatory approvals. Therefore, we believe we are well positioned to continue expanding our revenue for the following reasons: 
 
(1) | A higher number of companies in later phases of clinical trials; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Therapy companies requiring higher manufacturing abilities concurrent with a global reach; and 
(3) | An increasing need for the manufacturing scalability provided by a CDMO. 

Our CDMO Partners Around the World 
             We have leveraged the experience and expertise of MaSTherCell to build out a global network of CDMO centers. We believe that this international footprint will give a unique competitive advantage to MaSTherCell with harmonized manufacturing between the respective regional footprints. 
             To date we have set up CDMO facilities in South Korea and set the basis for process development in Israel. These have been set up as collaborative joint ventures where we have invested significant amounts as convertible loans. Under the arrangements, we have the ability to convert our loans into 50% of the equity in the entities. The joint venture documents also allow us a call option on the equity holdings of our partners such, if and when we determine to acquire ownership and control of these facilities.

Korea
            On March 14, 2016, we and CureCell Co., Ltd. (CureCell) entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the CureCell JVA) pursuant to which the parties are collaborating in the contract development and manufacturing of cell therapy products in Korea. Under the CureCell JVA, CureCell has procured, at its sole expense, a GMP facility and appropriate staff in Korea for the manufacture of cell therapy products. We shared with CureCell our knowhow in the field of cell therapy manufacturing, which know-how does not include the intellectual property included in the license from the THM to our Israeli Subsidiary. The parties pursue the joint venture through CureCell (the JV Company), with each party having 50% from the participating interest of the JV Company subject to the fulfillment by each party of his obligations under the CureCell JVA. 
             Under the CureCell JVA, the Company and CureCell each undertook to remit, within two years of the execution of the CureCell JVA, a minimum amount of $2 million to the JV Company, of which $1 million is to be in cash and the balance may be in an in-kind investment, the scope and valuation of which shall be preapproved in writing by CureCell and the Company. The Companys funding was made by way of a convertible loan. The CureCell JVA provides that, under certain specified conditions, we can require CureCell to sell to us its participating (including equity) interest in the JV Company in consideration for the issuance of our common stock based on the then valuation of the JV Company. As of November 30, 2017, we remitted to CureCell $2.1 million. 
 Israel
            On May 10, 2016, we and ATVIO Biotech Ltd., an Israeli company, (ATVIO) entered into a joint venture agreement pursuant to which the we are collaborating in the contract development and manufacturing of cell and virus therapy products in the field of regenerative medicine in Israel. We are pursuing the joint venture through ATVIO, in which we are holding a 50% participating interest therein, with the remaining 50% participating interest being held by the other shareholders of ATVIO. To date, ATVIO has procured, at its sole expense, a GMP facility and has been recruiting employees in Israel. Subject to the work plan that was approved by ATVIO and us, we have remitted to ATVIO a total of $1 million to defray the costs associated with the setting up and the maintenance of the GMP facility. Our funding was made by way of a convertible loan to ATVIO, which shall be convertible, at our option at any time, into 50% of the then outstanding equity capital immediately following such conversion. 
             Our global manufacturing network is envisioned as offering a global one-stop-shop manufacturing and logistics services and breakthrough technologies enabling promising therapies to more rapidly reach the market in a more cost-effective way. 
             On January 22, 2018 we announced a strategic organizational regrouping of our CDMO global manufacturing services offerings. The planned CDMO regrouping will utilize the global MaSTherCell brand for its unique technology and innovation activity located in Israel and serving the global cell & gene therapy markets. The primary purpose of the strategic regrouping is to create a more efficient CDMO corporate organization that can optimally utilize resources and more efficiently broaden, streamline and harmonize the CDMO service offerings on a global basis utilizing the quality and standards of MaSTherCell. In connection with this and in order to align our CDMO activities, we plan to transfer to a newly formed and wholly-owned Delaware-based holding company, named MaSTherCell Global Inc., our interests in MaSTherCell S.A., as well as in our joint venture partners in Israel and Korea. When successfully concluded, of which no assurance can be provided, each of MaSTherCell S.A., At-Vio Biotech Ltd. and CureCell Co. Ltd., will be direct subsidiaries of MaSTherCell Global Inc. 
 United States and Other Parts of the World
            We are currently in advanced negotiations with a prospective strategic partner in the U.S. and will continue to explore discussions with other strategic partners throughout the world to set up CDMO facilities in other geographic locations. While we expect to utilize similar structures as our other joint venture partners, we can provide no assurance that such efforts will be successful in these other joint venture endeavors.

Our Competitive Advantages 
             We offer the following benefits to our CDMO clients: 
             We enable our clients to go faster to the market in a cost-effective way. MaSTherCell continues to invest in its manufacturing capabilities to offer a one-stop-shop service to its customers from pre-clinical up to commercial. This stems from the finding that these companies' processes have to be set up right from the start in order for them to obtain approved products that have the simplest possible process and with the lowest possible cost of goods sold (COGS).
             Quality. MaSTherCell works alongside its customers to transform the promises of their cell-based therapies into a robust and scalable process, compliant with GMP requirements. Its stringent quality system is applied throughout the process and ensures identity, purity, stability, potency and robustness of cell therapy products from clinical phase I, II, III to commercialization. MaSTherCell continues to invest resources to maintain best practices in quality service, quality control, quality assurance and permanent staff training to uphold the highest standards. 
             Transforming academic technology to clinical manufacturing. One of the major issues with moving cell therapy products from bench to manufacturing bedside has been manufacturing bottlenecks. The heterogeneous nature of cell therapy products has introduced manufacturing complexity and regulatory concerns, as well as scale-up complexities that are not present within traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing. Over the years, MaSTherCell has developed experience and expertise necessary for transforming academic concepts into a clinical manufacturing program to support all phases of clinical trials. This includes assessing the clinical efficiency of the laboratory concept. 
             Access to a global network. Many companies developing autologous cell therapies envision using multiple manufacturing sites and processing centers to distribute the workload and minimize the shipping distances for such time- sensitive products. Many cell therapy products are fragile preparations that must be shipped and applied to a patient rapidly. This time pressure means that standard product-release testing procedures are not feasible. In particular, sterility testing often cannot be completed before patient treatment. This unique challenge in cell-therapy manufacturing requires tighter environmental and handling controls to greatly reduce any risk of sterility failure. Biotechnology companies have to anticipate their success and the logistics to cure at point of care. Therefore, the setup of a global CDMO meets this requirement and is the strategy behind our establishment of our CDMO facilities in Korea and Israel. To comply with anticipated regulatory harmonization, we have also invested in our Quality and Management Systems (QMS) and to structure them in a way they could be shared with either affiliated companies or business partners, and even with customers or prospects. South Korea, Israeli and European requirements are essentially the same, allowing MaSTherCell to implement its QMS model in a quick and efficient way. This truly international footprint will give a unique competitive advantage to MaSTherCell, thereby filling the gap of biotechnology companies requirement of quality comparability between the respective regional sites.

            Central continental locations to deal with key logistics challenges. With respect to this challenge, MaSTherCell has built up the following: 
 
 | Team of dedicated experts both from academic and industry backgrounds with a strong experience in cGMP dealing with not yet harmonized regulatory requirements (EMA, FDA); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | State-of-the-art facilities located next to airports; and 
 | Multi-continental footprints to deal with therapies administration at or nearby point of care as many cell therapy products have a short shelf life. 

             Providing value-added manufacturing capacity. One of the biggest challenges is developing reliable (quality) and robust manufacturing processes for cell-based therapy products that ensure adequate product safety, potency, and consistency at an economically viable cost. Additionally, manufacturing quality and comparability is at the heart of biotechnology companies challenges. MaSTherCell has built-up a strong expertise to customize the production and manufacturing process to suit the particular needs of a given client. This process facilitates a deep understanding of the clients needs and facilitates a long term revenue generating relationship. 
 Competition in the CDMO Field 
             MaSTherCell competes with a number of companies both directly and indirectly. Key competitors include the following CMOs and CDMOs: Lonza Group Ltd, Progenitor Cell Therapy (PCT) LLC (acquired by Hitachi), Pharmacell BV (acquired by Lonza), WuxiAppTec (WuXi PharmaTech (Cayman) Inc.), Cognate Bioservices Inc., Apceth GmbH & Co. KG, Eufets GmbH, Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, Cellforcure SASU, Cell Therapy Catapult Limited and Molmed S.p.A. MaSTherCell's services differ from these companies in two major aspects: 
 
 | Quality and expertise of its services: Clients identify the excellence of its facility, quality system, and people as a major differentiating point compared to competitors; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Flexible and tailored approach: MaSTherCell's philosophy is to build a true partnership with its clients and adapt itself to the clients needs, which entails no off-the-shelf process nor in-house technology platform, but a dedicated person in plant (of client), joint steering committees on each project and dedicated project managers. 


* Diagram above signifies one-stop-shop service offering from process development through quality manufacturing and logistics to point of care. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

             MaSTherCell strengthens its leading position by its one-stop-shop service offering, from pre-clinical to commercial, with a clear focus on COGS of manufacturing processes. This differentiation results in a price premium compared to other CMOs as MaSTherCell operates with a lean organization focused solely on cell therapy. Quality is a critical aspect of our industry, and we believe that MaSTherCell has developed unique expertise in this field. We devote significant resources to process development and manufacturing in order to optimize the safety and efficacy of our future product candidates for our customers, as well as our cost of goods and time to market. Our goal is to carefully manage our fixed cost structure, maximize optionality, and drive long-term cost of goods as low as possible. We believe that operating our own manufacturing facility, which provides us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, will enable a more rapid implementation of process changes, and will allow for better long-term margins.

            Finally, MaSTherCell is the only CDMO located in Belgium which logistically offers an ideal location given the high concentration of companies active in cell therapy, including potential clients and companies with complementary know-how, products and services. 
 Cell Therapy Business 
 Background 
             Diabetes Mellitus (DM), or simply diabetes, is a metabolic disorder usually caused by a combination of hereditary and environmental factors, and results in abnormally high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Diabetes occurs as a result of impaired insulin production by the pancreatic islet cells. The most common types of the disease are Type-1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type-2 Diabetes (T2D). In T1D, the onset of the disease follows an autoimmune attack of β-cells that severely reduces β-cell mass. T1D usually has an early onset and is sometimes also called juvenile diabetes. In T2D, the pathogenesis involves insulin resistance, insulin deficiency and enhanced gluconeogenesis, while late progression stages eventually lead to β-cell failure and a significant reduction in β-cell function and mass. T2D often occurs later in life and is sometimes called adult onset diabetes. Both T1D and late-stage T2D result in marked hypoinsulinemia, reduction in β-cell function and mass and lead to severe secondary complications, such as myocardial infarcts, limb amputations, neuropathies and nephropathies and even death. In both cases, patients become insulin-dependent, requiring either multiple insulin injections per day or reliance on an insulin pump. 
             Diabetes is one of the most challenging health problems in the 21st Century, incurring staggering health, social, and economic impact. Diabetes is currently the fourth or fifth leading cause of death in most developed countries. Diabetes has been declared an epidemic in many developing and newly industrialized nations. 
             Cell therapy is the prevention or treatment of human disease by the administration of cells that have been selected, multiplied and manipulated outside the body (ex vivo). To date, the most common type of cell therapy has been the replacement of mature, functioning cells through blood and platelet transfusions. Since the 1970s, first bone marrow and then blood and umbilical cord-derived stem cells have been used to restore bone marrow, as well as blood and immune system cells damaged by chemotherapy and radiation used to treat many cancers. These types of cell therapies are standard of practice world-wide and are typically reimbursed by insurance. Various cell therapies are in clinical development for an array of human diseases, including autoimmune, oncologic, neurologic and orthopedic diseases, among other indications. Orgenesis, as well as other companies, are developing cell therapies that are designed to address cancers, ischemic repair and immune modulation. While no assurances can be given regarding future medical developments, we believe that the field of cell therapy holds the promise to address several medical conditions and minimize or ameliorate the pain and suffering from many common diseases and/or from the process of aging. 
             Within the field of cell therapy, research and development using stem cells to treat a host of diseases and conditions has greatly expanded. All living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates, differentiates (matures) and perpetuates in an adult organism throughout its lifetime. Stem cells (in either embryonic or adult forms) are primitive and undifferentiated cells that have the unique ability to transform into or otherwise affect many different cells, such as white blood cells, nerve cells or heart muscle cells. Our technology employs a molecular and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin-producing cells as a treatment for diabetes. This new therapeutic approach does not use stem cells, but rather is focused on the use of autologous, fully mature, adult cells. 
             There are two general classes of cell therapies: allogeneic and autologous. In allogeneic procedures, cells collected from a person (the donor) are transplanted into, or used to develop a treatment for another patient (the recipient) with or without modification. In cases where the donor and the recipient are the same individual, these procedures are referred to as autologous.

            Our treatment for diabetes focuses on autologous cells that offer a low likelihood of rejection by the patient. We believe the long-term benefits of this treatment can best be achieved with an autologous product. For our purposes in the treatment of diabetes, our cells are derived from the liver or other adult tissue and are transdifferentiated to become adult Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) cells. 
             Through our Israeli Subsidiary and our Belgian Subsidiary, our goal is to advance our AIP cell-based therapy into clinical development. AIP cells utilize the technology of cellular trans-differentiation to transform an autologous adult liver cell into a fully functional and physiologically glucose-responsive insulin-producing cell. Treatment with AIP cells is expected to provide Type 1 Diabetes patients with long-term insulin independence. Because AIP cells are autologous, this benefit should be achieved and maintained without the need for concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. 
 Threats from Pancreas Islet Transplantation and Cell Therapies 
             To date, a significant portion of the amount invested in diabetes related research and development activities has been directed toward prevention and lifestyle management rather than toward development of a cure. For some patients with severe and difficult to control diabetes (hypoglycemic unawareness), islet transplants are considered. Pancreatic islets are the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. Scientists use enzymes to isolate the islets from the pancreas of a deceased donor. Because the islets are fragile, transplantation must occur soon after they are removed. Typically, a patient receives at least 10,000 islet equivalents per kilogram of body weight, extracted from pancreases obtained from different donors. Patients often require two separate transplants to achieve insulin independence.
            Transplants are often performed by an interventional radiologist, who uses x-rays and ultrasound to guide placement of a catheter - a small plastic tube - through the upper abdomen and into the portal vein of the liver. The islets are then infused slowly through the catheter into the liver. The patient receives a local anesthetic and a sedative. In some cases, a surgeon may perform the transplant through a small incision, using general anesthesia. Because the islets are obtained from cadavers that are unrelated to the patient, the patient needs to be treated with drugs that inhibit the immune response so that the patient doesnt reject the transplant. In the early days of islet transplantation, the drugs were so powerful that they actually were toxic to the islets; improvements in the procedure are widely used and are now referred to as the Edmonton Protocol. 
             Pancreatic islet transplantation (cadaver donors) is an allogeneic transplant, and, as in all allogeneic transplantations, there is a risk for graft rejection and patients must receive lifelong immune suppressants. Though this technology has shown good results clinically, there are several setbacks, such as patients being sensitive to recurrent T1D autoimmune attacks and a shortage in tissues available for islet cells transplantation. 
             Pancreatic islet auto transplantation is a means of reducing the risk of brittle diabetes following total pancreatectomy. In 1977, researchers at the University of Minnesota School of Medicine pioneered the first Total Pancreatectomy with Islet Autologous Transplant (TP-IAT) for the treatment for induced diabetes post-surgery. At that time, islet cell isolation techniques, which had been pursued to treat insulin-dependent diabetes via allotransplant, yielded variable results and raised uncertainty regarding the future efficacy of TP-IAT. Since then, advances in isolation and purification have improved islet transplant outcomes, and the practice of TP-IAT has expanded. In the United States, there are currently approximately 12 centers performing TP-IAT, with 1 to 2 centers annually establishing programs; there is no available information on the worldwide use of this procedure. 
             TP-IAT has the distinct advantage of allowing patients the ability to avoid the significant postoperative complication of surgically induced brittle diabetes. The severity of brittle diabetes, a condition in which a patient experiences both severe hyper and hypoglycemic episodes, should not be underestimated; in one early series, 50% of late deaths after TP were secondary to iatrogenic hypoglycemic episodes. Although total pancreatectomy in the era of modern endocrine and exocrine replacement therapy has witnessed improvements in long-term morbidity and mortality, it remains one of the most morbid abdominal operations performed today.

Our Solution 
             We are developing and bringing to clinical stage a technology that is based on the published work of Prof. Sarah Ferber, our Chief Science Officer and a researcher at THM, that demonstrates the capacity to induce a shift in the developmental fate of cells from the liver into pancreatic beta cell-like insulin-producing cells. Furthermore, those cells were found resistant to the autoimmune attack and able to produce insulin in a glucose-sensitive manner. Our cell therapy business derives from a licensing agreement entered into as of February 2, 2012 by Orgenesis Ltd., our Israeli Subsidiary, and THM pursuant to which our Israeli Subsidiary was granted a worldwide royalty bearing an exclusive license to certain information regarding a molecular and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin-producing cells as a treatment for diabetes (the License Agreement). See The THM License Agreement for details relating to this License Agreement. 
             Toward this goal, we are working to advance a unique product that combines cell-based therapy and regenerative medicine, (AIP) cells, into clinical development. AIP cells utilize the technology of cellular trans-differentiation to transform an autologous adult liver cell into an adult, fully functional and physiologically glucose-responsive pancreatic-like insulin producing cell. Treatment with AIP cells is expected to provide diabetes patients with long-term insulin independence. Our aim is to develop our AIP cell therapy in the treatment of diabetes by essentially correcting malfunctioning organs with new functional tissues created from the patients own existing organs. 
 
            Because the AIP cells are autologous, this benefit should be achieved and maintained without the need for concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. The procedure to generate AIP cells begins with liver tissue accessed via needle biopsy from a patient. The liver tissue is then sent to a CDMO, such as MaSTherCell, where biopsied liver cells are isolated, expanded and trans-differentiated into AIP cells. The final product is a solution of AIP cells, which are packaged in an infusion bag and sent back to the patients treating physician where the cells are transplanted back into the patients liver via portal vein infusion. The entire process, from biopsy to transplantation, is expected to take 5-6 weeks.

Unique Benefits of AIP Cells 
             We believe that our singular focus on the acquisition, development, and commercialization of AIP cells may have many and meaningful benefits over other technologies, including: 
 
 | Physiologically glucose-responsive insulin production within one week of AIP cell transplantation; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Insulin-independence within one month; 
 | Single course of therapy (~10-year insulin-independence); 
 | No need for concomitant immunosuppressive therapy; 
 | Return to (near) normal quality of life for patients; 
 | Single liver biopsy supplies unlimited source of therapeutic tissue (bio-banking for future use if needed); 
 | Highly controlled and tightly closed GMP systems; and 
 | Quality Control of final product upon release and distribution 

             We are aware of no other company focused on development of AIP cells based on trans-differentiation. The pharmaceutical industry is fragmented, and it is a competitive market. We compete with many pharmaceutical companies, both large and small and there may be technologies in development of which we are not aware. 
             We believe our ability to further develop our AIP cells is augmented by the following: 
             IP Strength - Orgenesis has broad patent claims on its process and has both issued and pending patents in the U.S. and internationally. The patent portfolio includes granted patent US 8119405, entitled Methods of inducing regulated pancreatic hormone production in non-pancreatic islet tissues, which includes broad claims on trans-differentiating any mature, non-pancreatic cell type into an islet cell phenotype. Importantly, the companys IP portfolio is not dependent on processes owned by other companies, such as embryonic stem cell technologies, production of endodermal intermediates or reprogramming (iPS) technologies. As a result, the company has both freedom to operate and ability to obstruct competitors in developing autologous cells for treatment of diabetes. 
             Simplicity - There is no need for anti-rejection treatment or encapsulation. Using liver as pancreatic progenitor tissue allows the diabetic patient to be the donor of his own insulin-producing tissue, thus allowing autologous implantations with no need for anti-rejection therapy, which restricts the target population only to adult, severe diabetic patients. Moreover, drugs used for preventing the allo-transplanted tissue rejection are deleterious to insulin producing cell function and to the patient.
             Safety - the generated cells do not regress to pluripotency, and no adverse effects of uncontrolled cells proliferation occur. The cells are already mature and can be inserted in to the patient following extensive quality assurance testing. Moreover, our cells transplanted in rodents do not cause any adverse effects even following many weeks in the animals. 
 -15-

            Availability - Sufficient liver cells to treat a patient as well to store cells for additional future treatments may be generated. The cells can be frozen and thawed, without losing the trans-differentiation capacity for up to 20 passages in culture. It is anticipated that a biopsy from the diabetic patient's own liver is sufficient to generate enough insulin-producing cells to replace the entire cell function and control blood glucose level. As opposed to islets that are non-dividing (i.e., post-mitotic), it is necessary to use stem cells to generate sufficient numbers of cells that are then differentiated. 
             Future Product Candidates - Currently, liver cells are best suited for generating AIP cells. Future products may involve the use of cell types other than liver that are more easily accessible from the diabetic patient or from unrelated donors. Additionally, other adult cells (i.e. fibroblasts) may be studied for trans-differentiation into functional cells in diseases other than insulin-dependent disorders (i.e. neurodegenerative). 
 The THM License Agreement
            Our cell therapy business derives from a licensing agreement entered into as of February 2, 2012 by Orgenesis Ltd., our Israeli Subsidiary, and THM pursuant to which our Israeli Subsidiary was granted a worldwide royalty bearing and exclusive license to certain information regarding a molecular and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin producing cells as a treatment for diabetes. By using therapeutic agents (i.e., PDX-1, and additional pancreatic transcription factors in an adenovirus-vector) that efficiently convert a sub-population of liver cells into pancreatic islets phenotype and function, this approach allows the diabetic patient to be the donor of his own therapeutic tissue. We believe that this provides major competitive advantage to the cell transformation technology of our Israeli Subsidiary. 
             As consideration for the license, our Israeli Subsidiary has agreed to pay the following to THM: 
 
1) | A royalty of 3.5% of net sales; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | 16% of all sublicensing fees received; 
3) | An annual license fee of $15,000, which commenced on January 1, 2012 and is due once every year thereafter (the Annual Fee). The Annual Fee is non-refundable, but it shall be credited each year due, against the royalty noted above, to the extent that such are payable, during that year; and 
4) | Milestone payments as follows: 


a) | $50,000 on the date of initiation of phase I clinical trials in human subjects; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) | $50,000 on the date of initiation of phase II clinical trials in human subjects; 
c) | $150,000 on the date of initiation of phase III clinical trials in human subjects; 
d) | $750,000 on the date of initiation of issuance of an approval for marketing of the first product by the FDA; and 
e) | $2,000,000, when worldwide net sales of products have reached the amount of $150,000,000 for the first time, (The Sales Milestone). 

             As of November 30, 2017, our Israeli Subsidiary has not reached any of these milestones. 
             In the event of an acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Israeli Subsidiary or of the Company and/or consolidation of the Israeli Subsidiary or the Company into or with another corporation (Exit), under the License Agreement, THM is entitled to elect, at its sole option, whether to receive from the Company a one-time payment based, as applicable, on the value at the time of the Exit of either 463,651 shares of common stock of the Company or the value of 1,000 ordinary shares of the Israeli Subsidiary at the time of the Exit. If THM elects to receive the consideration as a result of an Exit, the royalty payments will cease. 
             If THM elects to not receive any consideration as a result of an Exit, THM is entitled under the License Agreement to continue to receive all the rights and consideration it is entitled to pursuant to the License Agreement (including, without limitation, the exercise of the rights pursuant to future Exit events), and any agreement relating to an Exit event shall be subject to the surviving entitys and/or the purchasers undertaking towards THM to perform all of the Israeli Subsidiary's obligations pursuant to the License Agreement. 
 -16-

            The Israeli Subsidiary agreed to submit to THM a commercially reasonable plan which shall include all research and development activities as required for the development and manufacture of the products, including preclinical and clinical activities until an FDA or any other equivalent regulatory authoritys approval for marketing and including all regulatory procedures required to obtain such approval for each product candidate (a Development Plan), within 18 months from the date of the License Agreement. Under the License agreement, the Israeli Subsidiary undertook to develop, manufacture, sell and market the products pursuant to the milestones and time-frame schedule specified in the Development Plan. The Israeli Subsidiary submitted the Development Plan in May 2014. 
             Under the License Agreement, THM is entitled to terminate the License Agreement under certain conditions relating to a material change in the business of our Israeli Subsidiary or a breach of any material obligation thereunder or to a bankruptcy event of our Israeli Subsidiary. Under certain conditions, our Israeli Subsidiary may terminate the License Agreement and return the licensed information to THM. 
             In 2016 and 2017, the Israeli Subsidiary entered into a research service agreement with the Licensor. According to the agreements, the Israeli Subsidiary will perform a study at the facilities and use the equipment and personnel of the Sheba Medical Center, with annual consideration of approximately $88 thousand and $131 thousand, respectively.
 Marketing
            Our plan is to market and sell AIP cellular therapy as a stand-alone product and to provide supporting education and services to physicians and the healthcare providers that support them. In addition, we expect to provide appropriate and supportive services to the distribution networks that make our product available to treating physicians and facilities. Once marketing authorization is granted, we plan to market our product in North America, Europe and Asia. 
             As part of our long-term strategy, we will consider clinical development and commercialization collaborations and/or partnerships with international companies involved in the diabetes therapeutic area. 
 Competition 
             Insulin therapy is used for Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) patients who are not controlled with oral medications, although this therapy has well-known and well-characterized disadvantages. Weight gain is a common side effect of insulin therapy, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Injection of insulin causes pain and inconvenience for patients. Patient compliance and inconvenience of self-administering multiple daily insulin injections is also considered a disadvantage of this therapy. The most serious adverse effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycemia. 
             The global diabetes market comprising the insulin, insulin analogues and other anti-diabetic drugs has been evolving rapidly. Todays overall diabetes market is dominated by a handful of participants such as Novo Nordisk A/S, Eli Lilly and Company, Sanofi-Aventis, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Pfizer Inc., Merck KgaA, and Bayer AG. 
 CT Subsidiaries and Collaboration Agreements 
             Subject to raising the necessary funding, we intend to advance our cell therapy business by furthering this licensed technology to a clinical stage. We intend to devote significant resources to process development and manufacturing in order to optimize the safety and efficacy of our future product candidates, as well as our cost of goods and time to market. Our goal is to carefully manage our fixed cost structure, maximize optionality, and drive long-term cost of goods as low as possible. We believe that operating our own manufacturing facility will provide the Company with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, will enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and will allow for better long-term margins. 
 -17-

            We carry out our CT business through three wholly-owned and separate subsidiaries. This corporate structure allows us to simply the accounting treatment, minimize taxation and optimize local grant support. Our CT subsidiaries are as follows: 
 
 | United States: Orgenesis Maryland Inc.  This is the center of activity for North America currently focused on preparation for U.S. clinical trials. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | European Union: Orgenesis SPRL  This is the center of activity for Europe, currently focused on process development and preparation of European clinical trials. 
 | Israel: Orgenesis Ltd.  This is a research and technology center. 

             We have embarked on a strategy of collaborative arrangement with strategically situated third parties around the world. We believe that these parties have the expertise, experience and strategic location to advance our clinical development business. 
             On March 14, 2016, our Israeli Subsidiary, entered into a collaboration agreement with CureCell Co., Ltd. (CureCell), initially for the purpose of applying for a grant from the Korea Israel Industrial R&D Foundation (KORIL) for pre-clinical and clinical activities related to the commercialization of our AIP cell therapy product in Korea (the KORIL Grant). Subject to receiving the KORIL Grant, the parties agreed to carry out, at their own expense, their respective commitments under the work plan approved by KORIL and any additional work plan to be agreed between the Israeli Subsidiary and CureCell. The Israeli Subsidiary will own sole rights to any intellectual property developed from the collaboration which is derived under the Israeli Subsidiarys AIP cell therapy product and information licensed from THM. Subject to obtaining the requisite approval needed to commence commercialization in Korea, the Israeli Subsidiary has agreed to grant to CureCell, or a fully owned subsidiary thereof, under a separate sub-license agreement an exclusive sub-license to the intellectual property underlying the Companys AIP product solely for commercialization of the Israeli Subsidiarys products in Korea. As part of any such license, CureCell has agreed to pay annual license fees, ongoing royalties based on net sales generated by CureCell and its sublicensees, milestone payments and sublicense fees. Under the agreement, CureCell is entitled to share in the net profits derived by the Israeli Subsidiary from world-wide sales (except for sales in Korea) of any product developed as a result of the collaboration with CureCell. Additionally, CureCell was given the first right to obtain exclusive commercialization rights in Japan for adipose-derived AIP product, subject to CureCell procuring all of the regulatory approvals required for commercialization in Japan. As of the date of this filing, none of the requisite regulatory approvals for conducting clinical trials had been obtained. 
 Grant Funding
 Walloon Region, Belgium, Direction Générale Opérationnelle de l'Economie, de l'Emploi & de la Recherche (DGO6) 
             On March 20, 2012, MaSTherCell was awarded an investment grant from the DGO6 for €1,421 thousand. This grant is related to the investment in the production facility with a coverage of 32% of the investment planned. A first payment of €568 thousand was received in August 2013. In December 2016, the DGO6 paid to MaSTherCell €669 thousand on account of the grant, and the remaining grant amount has been declined.
             On November 17, 2014, Our Belgian Subsidiary, received the formal approval from the DGO6 for a €2.015 thousand ($2.4 million) support program for the research and development of a potential cure for Type 1 Diabetes. The financial support was composed of a €1,085 thousand (70% of budgeted costs) grant for the industrial research part of the research program and a further recoverable advance of €930 thousand (60% of budgeted costs) of the experimental development part of the research program. In December 2014, the Belgian Subsidiary received advance payment on amount of €1,209 thousand under the grant. The grants are subject to certain conditions with respect to the Belgian Subsidiarys work in the Walloon Region. In addition, the DGO6 is also entitled to a royalty upon revenue being generated from any commercial application of the technology. In 2017 we received from the DGO6 approval for Euro 1.8 million costs invested in the project, out of which Euro 1,192 thousand was funded by the DGO6. During 2017 we repaid to the DGO6 the down payments of €17 thousand. In addition, the final recoverable advance under this project is €150 thousand, out of which €15 thousand was paid by the Belgian Subsidiary during 2017. 
 -18-

            On April 2016, our Belgian Subsidiary received the formal approval from DGO6 for a budgeted €1,304 thousand ($1,455 thousand) support program for the development of a potential cure for Type 1 Diabetes. The financial support was awarded to our Belgian Subsidiary as a recoverable advance payment at 55% of budgeted costs, or for a total of €717 thousand ($800 thousand). The grant will be paid over the project period. On December 19, 2016, our Belgian Subsidiary received a first payment of €359 thousand ($374 thousand). In 2017, the DGO6 approved a no cost extension for the program until August 31, 2017. The total expenses under the program through November 30, 2017 were €787 thousand ($900 thousand). In addition, the DGO6 is also entitled to a (i) revocable advance of €215 thousand ($250 thousand) and (ii) a royalty upon revenue being generated from any commercial application of the technology. 
             On October 8, 2016, our Belgian Subsidiary received the formal approval from the DGO6 for a budgeted €12.3 million ($12.8 million) support program for the GMP production of AIP cells for two clinical trials that will be performed in Germany and Belgium. The project will be held during a period of three years commencing January 1, 2017. The financial support is awarded to our Belgian Subsidiary at 55% of budgeted costs, a total of €6.8 million ($7 million). The grant will be paid over the project period. On December 19, 2016, our Belgian Subsidiary received a first payment of €1.7 million ($1.8 million). The total expenses under the program through November 30, 2017 were €1,224 thousand ($1,451 thousand).

Maryland Technology Development Corporation 
             On June 30, 2014, our U.S. Subsidiary entered into a grant agreement with Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO). TEDCO was created by the Maryland State Legislature in 1998 to facilitate the transfer and commercialization of technology from Marylands research universities and federal labs into the marketplace and to assist in the creation and growth of technology-based businesses in all regions of the State. TEDCO is an independent organization that strives to be Marylands lead source for entrepreneurial business assistance and seed funding for the development of start-up companies in Marylands innovation economy. TEDCO administers the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund to promote State funded stem cell research and cures through financial assistance to public and private entities within the State. Under the agreement, TEDCO has agreed to give the U.S. Subsidiary an amount not to exceed approximately $406 thousand (the TEDCO Grant). The TEDCO Grant was used solely to finance the costs to conduct the research project entitled AIP during a period of two years.
 -19-

On July 22, 2014 and September 21, 2015, the U.S subsidiary received an advance payment of $406 thousand on account of the grant. On June 21, 2016, TEDCO approved an extension until June 30, 2017. Through November 30, 2017, the Company utilized $356 thousand. 
 Research and Development Expenditures 
             We incurred $3,326 and $2,637 thousand in research and development expenditures in the fiscal years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which $848 thousand and $480 thousand was covered by grant funding. 
Intellectual Property
             We will be able to protect our technology and products from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are thus an essential element of our business. 
             Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing it proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
             We own or have exclusive rights to four (4) United States and seven (7) foreign issued patents, three (2) pending applications in the United States, eleven (11) pending applications in foreign jurisdictions, including Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Singapore, and one (1) international PCT patent application, relating to the trans-differentiation of cells (including hepatic cells) to cells having pancreatic β-cell phenotype and function, and their use in the treatment of degenerative pancreatic disorders including diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and pancreatitis. 
             Granted U.S. patents which are directed to methods of making trans-differentiated cells will expire between 2021 and 2024, excluding any patent term extensions that might be available following the grant of marketing authorizations. Granted patents outside of the United States directed to making trans-differentiated cells and their uses will expire between 2020 and 2024. We have pending patent applications for methods of making our product, the product itself, and methods of using the product that, if issued, would expire in the United States and in countries outside of the United States between 2034 and 2035, excluding any patent term adjustment that might be available following the grant of the patent and any patent term extensions that might be available following the grant of marketing authorizations. These pending patent applications are directed to the following specific compositions and methods: a method of producing a transdifferentiated population of cells, a population of transdifferentiated cells, a method of treating a degenerative pancreatic disorder in a subject in need, a method of isolating a population of cells that have an enriched capacity for transcription factor induced trans-differentiation, an isolated population of cells having enriched trans-differentiation capacity, a method of increasing trans-differentiation efficiency in a population of cells, a population of liver cells enriched for cells predisposed to trans-differentiation, and a method of manufacturing a population of human insulin producing cells and the population of cells produced by the recited manufacturing method. 
 Government Regulation 
             We have not sought approval from the FDA for the AIP cells. Among all forms of cell therapy modalities, we believe that autologous cell replacement therapy seems to be of the highest benefit. We believe that it seems to be safer than other options as it does not alter the host genome but only alters the set of expressed epigenetic information that seems to be highly specific to the reprogramming protocol. It provides an abundant source of therapeutic tissue, which is not rejected by the patient and does not have to be treated by immune suppressants. It is highly ethical since no human organ donations or embryo-derived cells are needed. The proposed therapeutic approach does not require cell bio-banking at birth, which is both expensive and cannot be used for patients born prior to 2000. 
 -20-

            Over the past decade, many studies published in leading scientific journals confirmed the capacity of reprogramming adult cells from many of our mature organs to either alternate organs or to stem like cells. Most widely used autologous cell replacement protocols are used for autologous implantation of bone marrow stem cells. This protocol is widely used in patients undergoing a massive chemotherapy session that destroys their bone marrow cells. However, the stem cells used for cancer patients delineated above do not require extensive manipulation and is regarded by FDA as minimally manipulated. 
             An additional autologous cell therapy approach already used in man is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). In the United States, Genzyme Corporation provides the only FDA approved ACI treatment called Carticel. The Carticel treatment is designated for young, healthy patients with medium to large sized damage to cartilage. During an initial procedure, the patients own chondrocytes are removed arthroscopically from a non-load-bearing area from either the intercondylar notch or the superior ridge of the medial or lateral femoral condyles. 
             To aid us in our efforts to achieve the highest level of compliance with FDA requirements, we have looked to hire experts in the field of pharmaceutical compliance. 
 Regulatory Process in the United States 
             Our product is subject to regulation as a biological product under the Public Health Service Act and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA generally requires the following steps for pre-market approval or licensure of a new biological product: 

 | Pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests conducted in compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements to assess a drugs biological activity and to identify potential safety problems, and to characterize and document the products chemistry, manufacturing controls, formulation, and stability; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Submission to FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can start; 
 | Obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce a first human biologic drug candidate into humans in clinical trials; 
 | Conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP requirements; 
 | Compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations and standards; 
 | Submission to FDA of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for marketing that includes adequate results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials; 
 | FDA reviews the marketing application in order to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, effective and potent for its intended uses; and 
 | Obtaining FDA approval of the BLA, including inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility as compliant with cGMP requirements, prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the pharmaceutical agent. FDA may also require post marketing testing and surveillance of approved products or place other conditions on the approvals. 

             In addition, prior to the general regulatory process of a new biologic products, we expect to pursue an Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of Patients with Established Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Induced by Total pancreatectomy). The Orphan Drug Designation program provides orphan status to drugs and biologics which are defined as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases/disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives of the ODA, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing. A marketing application for a prescription drug product that has received orphan designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. 
             Obtaining Orphan drug designation will provide the following financial incentives: 
 
 | Tax Credits  50% of clinical trials costs;

 | Waiver of marketing application user fees  over $2 million; and

 | 7-year Marketing Exclusivity if first approved. 

Regulatory Process in Europe 
             The European Union (EU) has approved a regulation specific to cell and tissue therapy product, the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) regulation. For products such as our AIP cells that are regulated as an ATMP, the EU Directive requires: 

 | Compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP regulations and standards, pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Filing a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) with the various member states or a centralized procedure; 
 | Voluntary Harmonization Procedure (VHP), a procedure which makes it possible to obtain a coordinated assessment of an application for a clinical trial that is to take place in several European countries; 
 | Obtaining approval of Ethic Committees of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce the AIP into humans in clinical trials; 
 | Adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use; and 
 | Submission to EMEA for a Marketing Authorization (MA); 
 | Review and approval of the MAA (Marketing Authorization Application). 

             As in the U.S., prior to the general regulatory process of a new biologic products, we will prosecute an Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of Patients with Established Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Induced by Total pancreatectomy). In the EU, in order to be qualified, the prevalence must be below 5 per 10,000 of the EU population, except where the expected return on investment is insufficient to justify the investment. 
             Authorized orphan medicines benefit from ten years of protection from market competition with similar medicines with similar indications once they are approved. Companies applying for designated orphan medicines pay reduced fees for regulatory activities. This includes reduced fees for protocol assistance, marketing-authorization applications, inspections before authorization, applications for changes to marketing authorizations made after approval, and reduced annual fees. 
 Clinical Trials 
             Typically, both in the U.S. and the EU, clinical testing involves a three-phase process, although the phases may overlap. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients and are designed to provide information about product safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III clinical trials are generally large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide statistically valid proof of efficacy, as well as safety and potency. In some circumstances, FDA or EMA may require Phase IV or post-marketing trials if it feels that additional information needs to be collected about the drug after it is on the market. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, as well as clinical trial investigators. An agency may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data that have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Monitoring all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA or EMA.Employees 
             As of November 30, 2017, we had 103 full-time employees working at our Company and subsidiaries. In addition, we retain the services of outside consultants for various functions including clinical work, finance, accounting and business development services. Most of our senior management and professional employees have had prior experience in pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. None of our employees is covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
