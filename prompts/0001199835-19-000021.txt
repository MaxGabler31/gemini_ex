The Company also operates recording and mastering studios known as Aftermaster Studios Hollywood, at its Hollywood facilities. www.aftermaster.com
 
The name Aftermaster was derived from our technology being used to remaster and improve audio that has already been mastered, hence Aftermaster. Aftermaster is unique among audio processes as it greatly enhances the entire frequency range of an audio event without distortion or changing the underlying intent of the audio. The Aftermaster process is also popular for mastering previously un-mastered audio such as new recordings or live events.

Mission Statement
 
Aftermasters goal is to become one of the most innovative and important audio companies in the world through the development and licensing of proprietary audio technologies, the development and sales of leading-edge consumer and professional audio electronics products and through its contributions in the production, mixing and mastering of music, television and film audio.
Year End Summary
 
The year ending June 30, 2019, started out very strong but ended with manufacturing challenges which significantly impacted our results for the year over the year prior. High return rates and quality and reliability issues with the Companys Aftermaster Pro product, led the Company to suspend sales in December 2018, and dismiss its manufacturer. Subsequently the Company commenced an action in the United States District Federal Court for the Central District of California against the manufacturer, Infinity Power and Controls, LLC of Rock Springs, Wyoming for $30 million to recover direct and punitive damages.

Since suspending production, the Company undertook a complete redesign of its Aftermaster Pro unit and developed two new products, HearClear TV and the Superbar soundbar. The redesigned Aftermaster Pro has new features including Bluetooth, optical in/out and a handheld remote. Its sister unit HearClearTV is designed to significantly improve television audio for those that are hard of hearing. They will join the Aftermaster Studio Pro which is the Companys first product aimed at industrial and commercial applications. www.aftermaster.com/products
 
In order to address its ongoing financing and manufacturing challenges the Company entered into a groundbreaking, multi-year, Financing, Licensing, Manufacturing and Distribution agreement with Ritika Research Labs Pvt. Ltd. of Mumbai India. Ritika is a private company which has interests in manufacturing, electronics and product distribution and marketing. The agreement calls for Ritika to finance engineering, product development, manufacturing, inventory and the marketing and distribution of all Aftermasters products worldwide (excluding the US and Canada). The Company will receive tiered royalty payments on worldwide sales excluding the US and Canadian markets, which are retained by the Company.
 
The agreement is a true milestone for Aftermaster as it provides not only high-quality manufacturing and worldwide distribution, but also the funding and engineering support for Aftermasters manufacturing, inventory and future product development. The capital and operational relief has been structured in return for a revenue share and equity stake to Ritika, which greatly aligns our mutual efforts in the best interests of Aftermasters shareholders.
 
In addition, the partnership is expected to provide increased financial stability for Aftermaster with less financing related dilution for shareholders as well as a significant increase in the quality and reliability of its products. The partnership will also pave the way for Aftermaster to commit the resources for its elite engineering team to develop new, groundbreaking and competitive world class audio technologies.
 
Over the year, the Company continued to consolidate a majority of its convertible promissory notes, with three lenders. The Company also bundled several high interest rate notes into a single note for $900,204.45. The note carries an annual rate of 15% and is due April 30, 2021. Interest only payments are payable beginning January 2020. In addition, the Company has recently received financing commitments for what it believes to be the capital required to support its operations through to the resumption of the sales of its products.
 
During the year, the Company was awarded another patent relating to its Aftermaster technology. That patent was the Companys eighth issued audio and visual related patent and is one of several patents that are filed and pending.
 
Business and Products
 
Aftermaster Consumer and Professional Electronics Products
 
The Company has assembled a talented, technical and design team who design and develop the Companys consumer and professional electronics products. The first consumer electronic product to be introduced was the Aftermaster Pro, designed to dramatically improve the quality of TV audio. Aftermaster Pro is the worlds first personal audio re-mastering device and defines a new category in consumer electronics products by offering a product never before offered. Aftermaster Pro is a proprietary, first-to-market product which has no direct competition.
 
The number of existing televisions worldwide is substantial, and a majority of TV owners complain about their TV audio quality, especially the need to continually adjust the volume because of the difficulty in hearing dialogue in programming.
 
Smaller than an iPhone, the Aftermaster Pro transforms the audio of a TV to sound clearer, fuller, deeper, and more exciting. Aftermaster Pro connects easily via HDMI cables with virtually any A/V media source (i.e., cable, satellite box, etc.). Aftermaster Pro raises and clarifies TV dialogue in programming while significantly enhancing the quality of the overall audio content. This solves the longstanding need to continually adjust volume during a TV show to hear the dialogue.
 
Once the Company receives new inventory of its products, the Aftermaster Pro will again be for sale on HSN TV and HSN.com and other online retail outlets as well as through the Companys own website, Aftermasterpro.com.

The Company has also developed a new portable TV audio remastering product called HearClear TV™, which is based on its Aftermaster Pro product. HearClear is aimed at people with hearing loss and will initially be available through audiological clinics www.hearclear.tv. In addition, the Company also completed the development of a product called the Superbar™ which is the Companys first soundbar product. The new Superbar™ will include Aftermasters award winning and patented Aftermaster audio technology. The Company expects to begin manufacturing the Superbar™ late this year.
 
The Company has also recently designed and developed its first professional hardware product dubbed the Aftermaster Studio Pro which is the Companys first product designed for use in commercial audio applications. The new product is a 1 U, 19 rack-mount Aftermaster audio processor that allows a user to enhance any audio playback with Aftermaster to make any sound fuller, clearer, louder and deeper. It is expected to retail for $3,995 and can be seen at www.aftermastermaster.com/products. The Company believes that the worldwide market for its new product is significant, as it can be used in potentially hundreds of thousands of facilities worldwide: radio stations, private and public recording studios, places of worship, restaurants and bars, sports facilities, high-end residential, live concerts and concert facilities, hospitals – virtually any place where a business wants the audio to sound significantly better than anything that they can currently do. The product is expected to be available for pre-sale in the near future.
 
Additional Aftermaster branded consumer electronics products are under development, which we expect to introduce in the coming year.
 
ON Semiconductor/Aftermaster Audio Chip and Software
 
The Company jointly developed a unique semi-conductor chip with ON Semiconductor (ON) of Phoenix, Arizona, to commercialize its Aftermaster technology through audio semiconductor chips. ON is a multi-billion-dollar, multi-national semiconductor designer and manufacturer.
 
Branded the BelaSigna 300 AM chip, it is one of the smallest, high power/low voltage DSP chips available. It is small enough to fit into a hearing aid but equally effective in any size device with audio capability.
 
In conjunction with ON, we also completed the development of an Aftermaster software algorithm that is designed to be a standalone software product. We believe the sound quality from our algorithm provides a superior audio experience relative to other products on the market.
 
The algorithm and chips allow consumer product manufacturers an opportunity to offer a significantly improved and differential audio experience in their products without having to significantly change hardware and form factor designs. We hope to generate significant revenues through the sale of the ON/Aftermaster chips and software licensing.
 
Promaster On-line Music Mastering
 
Promaster is an online music mastering, streaming, and storage service designed for independent artists which utilizes proprietary audio technologies developed by Aftermaster.
 
Tens of millions of songs are produced, distributed and played on the Internet each month around the world by independent artists. However, many of these artists lack the financial and technical means to master, or finish their composition, as a professional mastering session can cost up to $500 per song. Now, with the Promaster online platform, musicians can transmit their music directly to the Promaster HD website, where it can be mastered with Aftermaster technology for $9.99 per song. Each user receives four different mastered versions of their song done in different styles, and they can preview 90 seconds of each version to make a decision about whether or not they want to buy it.
 
Promaster creates a compelling offering for those seeking to significantly enhance the quality of their music for personal use, or with intent to showcase their music in hopes of advancing their career aspirations. The service also offers additional features such as file storage. Based on the enormous addressable market for this product, we believe that with effective marketing Promaster has the potential to generate significant revenues for the Company.

Muzik Headphones
 
The Company is party to an agreement with headphone manufacturer Muzik, Inc., to license its Aftermaster technology (through both its Companys proprietary DSP chip and software application) for Muzik products. Known as the smartphone of headphones, award-winning Muzik has created one of the worlds most advanced wireless headphones. Muziks proprietary voice command and multiple hot keys allow a user to access Spotify, Siri and connect their headphones to over 300 apps from fitness, news, and productivity to the connected home, commerce, automotive, and social media. Muzik is considered one of the most important new headphone designer and manufacturer. The Company expects its technology to be implemented in Muzik products in the future.
Recording Studios
 
The Company operates six recording and mastering studios in Hollywood, California, all located next to the Companys offices at the Crossroads of the World complex. The largest studio is a world-class music recording studio originally built by music legend Graham Nash and made famous by Crosby, Stills and Nash in 1977. The studio is equipped with state-of-the-art recording and mixing equipment, and it is used for both audio research and development as well as to generate revenue from rental to prominent musicians.

Our Aftermaster audio technology is an internally-developed, proprietary (patented and patents pending) mastering, remastering and audio processing technology which makes virtually any audio source sound significantly louder, fuller, deeper and clearer. Aftermaster is a groundbreaking technology which eliminates the weaknesses found in other audio enhancement and processing technologies while offering a much superior audio experience for consumer and industrial applications. We believe that our Aftermaster audio technology is one of the most significant breakthroughs in digital audio processing technology and has the potential to create significant revenues for the Company. The broad commercialization of this technology is a top priority for the Company.
 
As the convergence of features on consumer electronics continues, it is becoming more difficult for leading consumer electronics companies to differentiate their products. We believe that Aftermaster provides a unique and significant competitive advantage for consumer electronics manufacturers by offering their customers a superior audio experience. Aftermaster technology can be incorporated into most audio capable devices through the addition of an Aftermaster DSP chip or Aftermaster software. Such uses are intended to include phones (i.e., mobile, home, business and VoIP); headphones; televisions; stereo speakers; stereos (i.e., home, portable, commercial and automobile); and computers (i.e., desktop, laptop and tablets).
 
Aftermaster audio is also the only commercial audio enhancement technology available that is also used for professional music mastering because it enhances the entire frequency range without distortion or changing the underlying intent of the music. The technology has been used to master music created by some of the worlds most popular artists. Further information on Aftermaster and Aftermaster products can be found at www.Aftermaster.com.
