Item 1.  Business
Exterran Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Exterran Corporation,” “our,” “we” or “us”), a Delaware corporation formed in March 2015, is a global systems and process company offering solutions in the oil, gas, water and power markets. We are a leader in natural gas processing and treatment and compression products and services, providing critical midstream infrastructure solutions to customers throughout the world. Outside the United States of America (“U.S.”), we are a leading provider of full-service natural gas contract compression and a supplier of aftermarket parts and services. Our manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S., Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.
On November 3, 2015, Archrock, Inc. (named Exterran Holdings, Inc. prior to November 3, 2015) (“Archrock”) completed the spin-off (the ‘‘Spin-off”) of its international contract operations, international aftermarket services and global fabrication businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named Exterran Corporation. Following the completion of the Spin-off, we and Archrock became and continue to be independent, publicly traded companies with separate boards of directors and management. 
General
We provide our products and services to a global customer base consisting of companies engaged in all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry, including large integrated oil and natural gas companies, national oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas producers and oil and natural gas processors, gatherers and pipeline operators. We operate in three primary business lines: contract operations, aftermarket services and product sales. The nature and inherent interactions between and among our business lines provide us with opportunities to cross-sell and offer integrated product and service solutions to our customers.
For financial data relating to our reportable business segments or countries that accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in any of the last three fiscal years or 10% or more of our property, plant and equipment, net, as of December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016, see Part II, Item 7 (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) and Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 (collectively referred to as “Financial Statements,” and individually referred to as “balance sheets,” “statements of operations,” “statements of comprehensive income (loss),” “statements of stockholders’ equity” and “statements of cash flows” herein). 
Contract Operations
In our contract operations business, we provide compression and processing and treating services through the operation of our natural gas compression equipment and crude oil and natural gas production and process equipment for our customers. In addition to these services, we also offer water treatment and power solutions to our customers on a stand-alone basis or integrated into our natural gas compression or crude oil production and processing solutions. Our services include the provision of personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supplies to meet our customers’ natural gas compression and oil and natural gas production and processing service needs. Activities we may perform in meeting our customers’ needs include engineering, designing, sourcing, constructing, installing, operating, servicing, repairing, maintaining and demobilizing equipment owned by us necessary to provide these services.

We generally enter into contracts with our contract operations customers with initial terms ranging between three to 12 years. In many instances, we are able to renew those contracts prior to the expiration of the initial term and in other instances, we may sell the underlying assets to our customers pursuant to purchase options or negotiated sale agreements. If a contract is not renewed or a customer does not purchase the underlying assets, our equipment is generally returned to our premises for future redeployment. Our contracts may include several compressor units on one site or entire facilities designed to process and treat produced oil or natural gas to make them suitable for end use, which may require us to make significant investments in equipment, facilities and related installation costs. Our commercial contracts generally require customers to pay a monthly service fee even during periods of limited or disrupted oil or natural gas feed flows, which we believe provide us with relatively stable and predictable cash flows. Additionally, because we typically do not take title to the oil or natural gas that we compress, process or treat, and because the natural gas we use as fuel for our equipment is supplied by our customers, we have limited direct exposure to short-term commodity price fluctuations.
Our equipment is operated and maintained in accordance with established operational procedures and maintenance schedules. These operations and maintenance procedures are updated as technology changes and as our operations team develops new techniques and procedures. In addition, because our field technicians regularly operate and maintain our contract operations equipment, they are familiar with the condition of our equipment and can readily identify potential problems. In our experience, this in-house expertise and these maintenance procedures maximize equipment life and unit availability, minimize avoidable downtime and lower the overall maintenance expenditures over the equipment life. We believe our contract operations services generally allow our customers to achieve higher production rates and lower unit costs of operation than they would otherwise achieve with their own operations, resulting in increased revenue and margin for our customers. In addition, outsourcing these services allows our customers flexibility for their compression and production and processing needs while limiting their upfront capital requirements. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 26% of our revenue and 62% of our gross margin was generated from contract operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.4 billion of unsatisfied performance obligations (commonly referred to as backlog), of which approximately $292 million is expected to be recognized as revenue before December 31, 2019. Our contract operations backlog consists of unfilled orders based on signed contracts and does not include potential sales pursuant to letters of intent received from customers. Our contract operations business is capital intensive. As of December 31, 2018, the net book value of property, plant and equipment associated with our contract operations business was $823.4 million.
Aftermarket Services
In our aftermarket services business, we sell parts and components and provide operations, maintenance, repair, overhaul, upgrade, startup and commissioning and reconfiguration services to customers who own their own oil and natural gas compression, production, processing, treating and related equipment. Our services range from routine maintenance services and parts sales done on a transactional basis to the full operation and maintenance of customer-owned equipment under long-term agreements. 
We generally enter into contracts with our operation and maintenance customers with initial terms ranging between one to four years, and in some cases, in excess of five years. In many instances, we are able to renew those contracts prior to the expiration of the initial term. We believe that we are particularly well qualified to provide these services because of our highly experienced operating personnel and technical and engineering expertise gained through providing similar services as part of our contract operations business. In addition, our aftermarket services business complements our strategy to provide integrated infrastructure solutions to our customers because it enables us to continue to serve our customers after the sale of any products or facilities manufactured through our product sales business. Our business approach is designed to leverage our aftermarket services with our product sales business to provide full life-cycle services to customers who buy equipment from us and we also seek to sell those same aftermarket services to customers who have bought similar equipment from other companies based on our existing experience and infrastructure available to support them.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 9% of our revenue and 8% of our gross margin was generated from aftermarket services.

Product Sales
In our product sales business, we design, engineer, manufacture, install and sell natural gas compression packages as well as equipment used in the treating and processing of crude oil and natural gas primarily to major and independent oil and natural gas producers as well as national oil and natural gas companies around the world. We offer a broad range of equipment designed to process crude oil and natural gas into hydrocarbon commodities suitable for end use. Our products include wellhead, gathering, residue and high pressure natural gas compression equipment, cryogenic plants, mechanical refrigeration and dew point control plants, condensate stabilizers, water treatment equipment, integrated power generation and skid-mounted production packages designed for both onshore and offshore production facilities. We believe the broad range of products we sell through our global operating structure enables us to take advantage of the ongoing, worldwide energy infrastructure build-out.
We design, engineer, manufacture, sell and, in certain cases, install, skid-mounted natural gas compression equipment to meet standard or unique customer specifications. Generally, we manufacture compressors sold to third parties according to each customer’s specifications. We purchase components for these compressors from third party suppliers including several major engine and compressor original equipment manufacturers in the industry. We also sell pre-engineered compressor units designed to maximize value and fast delivery to our customers. Typically, we expect our compressor equipment backlog to be manufactured and delivered within a three to 12 month period.
We also sell custom-engineered, built-to-specification natural gas and oil processing and treating equipment, including designing facilities comprised of a combination of our products integrated into a solution that meets our customers’ needs. Some of these projects are located in remote areas and in developing countries with limited oil and natural gas industry infrastructure. To meet most customers’ rapid schedule requirements and minimize customer downtime, we maintain an inventory of standard products and longer lead-time components used to manufacture our products to our customers’ specifications. Typically, we expect our processing and treating equipment backlog to be produced within a six to 24 month period.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 65% of our revenue and 30% of our gross margin was generated from product sales. As of December 31, 2018, our backlog in product sales was approximately $706 million, of which approximately $690 million is expected to be recognized as revenue before December 31, 2019. Our product sales backlog consists of unfilled orders based on signed contracts and does not include potential product sales pursuant to letters of intent received from customers.

Industry Overview
Natural Gas Compression
Natural gas compression is a mechanical process whereby the pressure of a given volume of natural gas is increased to a desired pressure for movement from one point to another and is essential to the production and transportation of natural gas. Compression is typically required several times during the natural gas production and transportation cycle, including (i) at the wellhead, (ii) throughout gathering and distribution systems, (iii) into and out of processing and storage facilities and (iv) along pipelines. Natural gas compression can also be used to re-inject associated gas into producing wells to provide enhanced oil recovery.

Our contract operations business is comprised primarily of large horsepower internal combustion engine or electric motor-driven reciprocating compressors that are typically deployed in facilities comprised of several compressors on one site. A significant portion of this business involves comprehensive projects that require the design, engineering, manufacture, delivery and installation of several compressors on one site coupled with related natural gas treating and processing equipment. We are able to serve our customers’ needs for such projects through our product sales business and with follow-on services from our aftermarket services business, or through the provision of our contract operations services.
Processing and Treating
Crude oil and natural gas are generally not marketable products as produced raw at the wellhead and must be processed or treated to meet hydrocarbon commodity specifications before they can be transported to market. Processing and treating equipment is used to separate and treat oil and natural gas as they are produced to achieve a marketable quality of product. Production processing typically involves the separation of oil and natural gas and the removal of contaminants or the separation of marketable liquids from the gas stream prior to transportation. The end result is “pipeline” or “sales” quality crude oil and natural gas. Further processing or refining is almost always required before oil or natural gas is suitable for use as fuel or feedstock for petrochemical production. Production processing normally takes place in the “upstream” and “midstream” sectors, while refining and petrochemical processing is referred to as the “downstream” sector. Wellhead or upstream processing and treating equipment include a wide and diverse range of products.
We manufacture custom-engineered, built-to-specification natural gas and oil processing and treating equipment. We also provide integrated solutions comprised of a combination of our products into a single offering, which typically consist of much larger equipment packages than standard equipment and are generally used in much larger scale production operations. The custom equipment sector is primarily driven by global economic trends, and the specifications for purchased equipment can vary significantly. Technology, engineering capabilities, project management, available manufacturing space and quality control standards are the key drivers in the custom equipment sector.
Outsourcing
Natural gas producers, transporters and processors choose to outsource their operations due to the benefits and flexibility of contract operations services. In particular, we believe outsourcing compression, production and processing operations to experienced operators like us offers customers:

• | access to our specialized personnel and technical skills, including engineers, operators and field service and maintenance employees, which we believe generally leads to improved production rates and increased throughput and therefore higher revenues and margins;


• | the ability to increase their profitability by transporting or producing a higher volume of natural gas through decreased equipment downtime and reduced operating, maintenance and equipment costs by allowing us, as the service provider, to efficiently manage their operations; and


• | the flexibility to deploy their capital on projects more directly related to their primary business of hydrocarbon exploration and production by reducing their investment in compression, production and processing equipment and related maintenance capital requirements.

Oil and Natural Gas Industry Cyclicality and Volatility
Changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending normally result in changes in demand for our products and services. However, we believe our contract operations business is less impacted by commodity prices than certain other energy service products and services because compression, production and processing services are necessary for oil and natural gas to be delivered from the wellhead to end users. Furthermore, our contract operations business is tied primarily to global oil and natural gas production and consumption trends, which are generally less cyclical in nature than exploration activities.
Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to fluctuations. This is primarily because the industry is driven by commodity demand and corresponding price movements. When oil and natural gas price increases occur, producers typically increase their capital expenditures, which generally results in greater activity levels and revenues for equipment providers to the oil and gas industry. During periods of lower oil or natural gas prices, producers typically decrease their capital expenditures, which generally results in lower activity levels and revenues for equipment providers to the oil and gas industry.
7

Seasonal Fluctuations
Our results of operations have not historically reflected material seasonal tendencies and we do not believe that seasonal fluctuations will have a material impact on us in the foreseeable future.
Markets, Customers and Competition
Our global customer base consists primarily of companies engaged in all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry, including large integrated oil and natural gas companies, national energy companies, independent producers and natural gas processors, gatherers and pipeline operators.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, MPLX LP (“MPLX”) accounted for approximately 15% of our total revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Archrock accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenue and during the year ended December 31, 2016, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”) accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016. The loss of our business with MPLX, Archrock or Petrobras, unless offset by additional sales to other customers, or the inability or failure of MPLX, Archrock or Petrobras to meet its payment obligations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We currently operate in approximately 25 countries. We have manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Singapore and the United Arab Emirates and offices in most of the major oil and gas regions around the world.
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Overall, we experience considerable competition from companies that may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within our industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole and to more readily take advantage of available opportunities. We believe we are competitive with respect to price, equipment availability, customer service, flexibility in meeting customer needs, technical expertise, quality and reliability of our compression, processing and treating equipment and related services. We face vigorous competition throughout our businesses, with some companies competing with us in multiple business segments. In our product sales business, we have different competitors in the standard and custom-engineered equipment sectors. Competitors in the standard equipment sector include several large companies and a large number of small, regional fabricators. Our competition in the custom-engineered sector consists mainly of larger companies with the ability to provide integrated projects and product support after the sale.
We expect to face increased competition as we seek to diversify our customer base and increase utilization of our service offerings.
The separation and distribution agreement from the Spin-off contained certain noncompetition provisions addressing restrictions on our ability to provide compression contract operations and aftermarket services in the U.S. and on Archrock’s ability to provide compression contract operations and aftermarket services outside the U.S. and product sales to customers worldwide which expired on November 3, 2018.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We manufacture natural gas compression and oil and natural gas processing and treating equipment to provide contract operations services and to sell to third parties from components which we acquire from a wide range of suppliers. These components represent a significant portion of the cost of our compression and processing and treating equipment products. Increases in raw material costs cannot always be offset by increases in our products’ sales prices. While many of our materials and components are available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices, we obtain some of the components, including compressors and engines, used in our products from a limited group of suppliers. We occasionally experience long lead times for components, including compressors and engines, from our suppliers and, therefore, we may at times make purchases in anticipation of future orders.

Environmental and Other Regulations
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex U.S. federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that could have a material impact on our operations or financial condition. Our operations are regulated under a number of laws governing, among other things, discharges of substances into the air, ground and regulated waters, the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances, disclosure of information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations, and occupational health and safety.
Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. In certain circumstances, laws may impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. In addition, it is not uncommon for third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. We currently own or lease, and in the past have owned or leased, a number of properties that have been used in support of our operations for a number of years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons, hazardous substances, or other regulated wastes may have been disposed of, or released, on or under the properties owned by us, leased by us or other locations where such materials have been taken for disposal by companies sub-contracted by us. In addition, many of these properties have been previously owned or operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or other regulated wastes were not under our control. These properties and the materials released or disposed thereon may be subject to various laws that could require us to remove or remediate historical property contamination, or to perform certain operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently under any order requiring that we undertake or pay for any cleanup activities. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not receive any such order in the future.
We believe the global trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in these laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, emission or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,300 employees. Many of our employees outside of the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We generally consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.
