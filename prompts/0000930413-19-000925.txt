The Company is not party to any long term contracts regarding the deliveries of its supplies and components. It generally purchases such items pursuant to written purchase orders of both the individual and blanket variety. Blanket purchase orders usually cover the purchase of a larger amount of items at fixed prices for delivery and payment on specific dates.
 
For Boonton and Noisecom products, the Company develops, designs, manufactures, assembles, calibrates and tests the products at our facility in Parsippany, New Jersey. Testing of Boonton and Noisecom products is generally accomplished at the end of the manufacturing process and is performed in-house, as are all quality control processes.
 
Approximately 49% of Microlab products are sourced from contract manufacturers based on Microlab designs or technical and quality specifications with the remainder designed and manufactured by the Company in Parsippany, New Jersey. All Microlab products are tested by the Company in Parsippany, New Jersey.
 
CommAgility hardware products are built by contract manufacturers to CommAgility designs, and tested either by the contract manufacturer or by CommAgility. Software products are licensed to customers through a system that allows the customer to download the software once access has been granted.
 
Warranty and Service
 
The Company typically provides one to three year warranties on all of its products covering both parts and labor. The Company, at its option, repairs or replaces products that are defective during the warranty period if the proper preventive maintenance procedures have been followed by its customers.
 
In cases of defective products the customer typically returns them to the Company’s facility. The Company’s service personnel replace or repair the defective items and ship them back to the customer. Generally, all servicing is done at the Company’s facility, and the Company charges its customers a fee for those service items that are not covered by warranty. The Company typically does not offer their customers any formal written service contracts.
 
Product Liability Coverage
 
The testing of electronic communications equipment and the accurate transmission of information entail a risk of product liability to the Company. Product liability claims could be asserted against the Company by end-users of any of the Company’s products. The Company maintains product liability insurance coverage and no claims have been asserted for product liability due to a defective or malfunctioning device in the past 5 years.
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our intellectual property, including its methodologies, is critical to our success and competitive position. We rely on a combination of U.S. and foreign patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. All employees are subject to the Company’s policies to ensure that all of the Company’s intellectual property and business information are maintained in confidence. Key employees have signed non-disclosure and non-competition agreements.
Regulation
 
Environmental
 
The Company’s operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations that limit discharges into the environment, establish standards for the handling, generation, use, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous materials, substances and waste, and require cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater.
 
The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (the “NJDEP”) conducted an investigation in 1982 concerning disposal at a facility previously leased by the Company’s Boonton operations. The focus of the investigation involved certain materials formerly used by Boonton’s manufacturing operations at that site and the possible effect of such disposal on the aquifer underlying the property. The disposal practices and the use of the materials in question were discontinued in 1978. The Company has cooperated with the NJDEP investigation and has diligently pursued the matter to resolve it in accordance with applicable NJDEP operating procedures. The above referenced activities were conducted by Boonton prior to our acquisition of that entity in 2000.

In 1982, Boonton and the NJDEP agreed upon a plan to correct ground water contamination at the site, located in the township of Parsippany-Troy Hills, pursuant to which wells have been installed by Boonton. The plan contemplates that the wells will be operated and that soil and water samples will be taken and analyzed until such time that contamination levels are satisfactory to the NJDEP. In 2014, the Company received approval for a groundwater permit from the NJDEP to carry out the final remedial action work plan and report. Under the final phase of the plan, there will be limited and reduced monitoring and testing as long as concentrations at the site continue on a decreasing trend.
 
Expenditures incurred by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 in connection with monitoring and testing at the site amounted to approximately $8,000 and $1,000, respectively. While management anticipates that the expenditures in connection with this site will not be substantial in future years, the Company could be subject to significant future liabilities and may incur significant future expenditures if further contaminants from Boonton’s testing are identified and the NJDEP requires additional remediation activities. Our estimate of future monitoring and testing costs is $35,000 through 2027 when we expect final release from the NJDEP. The Company will continue to be liable under the plan, in all future years, until such time as the NJDEP releases the Company from all obligations.
 
At this time, the Company believes that it is in material compliance with all environmental laws, does not anticipate any material expenditure to meet current or pending environmental requirements, and generally believes that its processes and products do not present any unusual environmental concerns. Besides the matter referred to above with the NJDEP, the Company is unaware of any existing, pending or threatened contingent environmental liability that may have a material adverse effect on its ongoing business operations.
 
Workplace Safety
 
The Company’s operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health. The Company believes it is in material compliance with these laws and regulations and does not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
 
ITAR and Export Controls
 
The Company is subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulation, or ITAR. ITAR requires export licenses from the U.S. Department of State for products shipped outside the U.S. that have military or strategic applications. Because some of the Company’s products could have military or strategic applications, it must ensure its compliance with ITAR.
 
In addition, the Company is subject to the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, which regulates the export of certain “dual use” items and technologies and, in some instances, requires a license from the U.S. Department of Commerce in connection with sales of the Company’s products.
 
FAR and DFARS
 
The Company’s contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (“FAR”) regarding government procurement. Further, certain of the Company’s contracts are subject to the IT security requirements of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (“DFARS”) for controlled unclassified information.
Employees
 
As of February 22, 2019, the Company has 156 full time employees. The Company is not subject to collective bargaining agreements in the United States or internationally and considers its relationship with its employees to be good.
Investor Information
 
The Company is subject to the disclosure requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Therefore, the Company files periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.
