Industry Background
 Enterprises are adopting new Information Technology (“IT”) delivery models and applications that require fundamental network alterations and enhancements spanning from the access edge to the data center. With the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we believe IT teams in every industry will need more control and better insights than ever before to ensure secure, distributed connectivity and comprehensive centralized visibility. Machine Learning (“ML”) and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) technologies have the potential to vastly improve the network experience in the post-pandemic world by collating large data sets to increase accuracy and derive resolutions to improve the operation of the network. When ML and AI are applied with cloud-driven networking and automation, administrators can quickly scale to provide productivity, availability, accessibility, manageability, security, and speed, regardless of how distributed the network is. 
 We believe that the network has never been more vital than it is today. As administrators grapple with more data, coming from more places, more connected devices, and more Software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) based applications, the cloud is fundamental to establishing a new normal. Traditional network offerings are not well-suited to fulfill enterprise expectations for rapid delivery of new services, more flexible business models, real-time response, and massive scalability.
 As enterprises continue to migrate increasing numbers of applications and services to either private clouds or public clouds offered by third parties and to adopt new IT delivery models and applications, they are required to make fundamental network alterations and enhancements spanning from device access points (“AP”) to the network core. In either case, the network infrastructure must adapt to this new dynamic environment. Intelligence and automation are key if enterprises are to derive maximum benefit from their cloud deployments. 
 Service providers are investing in network enhancements with platforms and applications that deliver data insights, provide flexibility, and can quickly respond to new user demands and 5G use cases.
 We believe Extreme stands to benefit from the use of its technology to manage distributed campus network architecture centrally from the cloud. Extreme has blended a dynamic fabric attach architecture that delivers simplicity for moves and changes at the edge of the network together with corporate-wide role-based policy. This enables customers to migrate to new cloud managed switching and Wi-Fi, agnostic of the existing networking or wireless equipment they already have installed. In the end, we expect these customers to see lower operating and capital expenditures, lower subscription costs, lower overall cost of ownership and more flexibility along with a more resilient network.
 We estimate the total addressable market for our Enterprise Networking solutions consisting of cloud networking, wireless local area networks (“WLAN”), data center networking, ethernet switching, campus local area networks (“LAN”), and software-defined wide area network (“SD-WAN”) solutions to be approximately $33 billion and growing at approximately 12% annually over the next three years. This is comprised of $22 billion for campus networking, $4.6 billion for 5G service available market in 5G and data centers, for which Extreme is targeting growing to approximately $50 - $100 million per year over the next three to five years, and a $2.2 billion SD-WAN market. We also participate in the $4 billion networking software market for solutions such as cloud-based network management, network automation, on-premise network management, and other networking related software.

 We continue to develop and execute a number of marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products by communicating the value of our solutions to our existing and potential customers, our distribution channels, our resellers and our technology alliance partners. Our marketing efforts include participation in industry tradeshows, conferences and seminars, publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals, communication across social media channels, frequent updates to our publicly available website, promotions, web-based training courses, advertising, analyst relations and public relations. We also submit our products for independent product testing and evaluation. Extreme participates in numerous industry analyst ratings including Gartner Magic Quadrants, Gartner Critical Capabilities, Gartner Peer Insights, Forrester Waves, IDC MarketScape and InfoTech Vendor Landscapes.
Backlog
 Actual shipments of product depend on the then-current capacity of our contract manufacturers and the availability of materials and components from our vendors. Current supply chain constraints have led to longer lead times before we are able to ship orders. We are working with our partners and customers to provide product and have granted some flexibility in revising orders to compensate for the current situation. Although we believe the orders included in the backlog are firm, all orders are subject to possible rescheduling by customers, and cancellations by customers, which we may elect to allow on an exception basis. Therefore, we do not believe our backlog, as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual revenues for any future period.
 Our product backlog at June 30, 2022, net of anticipated back-end rebates for distributor sales, was $513.0 million, compared to $105.0 million at June 30, 2021. The increase in backlog is primarily attributable to supply chain constraints causing order fulfillment delays.

Seasonality
 Like many of our competitors, we historically have experienced seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns, which generally adversely affect our first and third fiscal quarters. This pattern should not be relied upon or be considered indicative of our future performance, as it has varied in the past.
Manufacturing
 We utilize a global sourcing strategy that emphasizes procurement of materials and product manufacturing in competitive geographies. We rely upon third-party contract manufactures and original design manufacturers (“ODM”), such as Alpha Networks, Lite-On Technology Corporation, Foxconn, Quanta, Senao Networks, Sercomm Corporation and Wistron NeWeb Corporation to manufacture, support and ship our products, and therefore are exposed to risks associated with their businesses, financial condition, geographies and geopolitical conflict in which they operate. Our arrangements with these Tier 1 manufacturers generally provide for quality, cost, and delivery requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as continuity of supply; inventory management; flexible capacity, quality, and cost management; oversight of manufacturing; and conditions for use of our intellectual property that allows us to adjust more quickly to changing end-customer demand. We also leverage and depend on the strong Corporate and Social Responsibility policies and standards of our Tier 1 manufacturers. The ODM manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls, which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products. To mitigate security risks associated with conducting business across our interconnected supply chain we have a Supply Chain and Information Security Policy and related procedures for communicating our requirements to suppliers and conducting annual compliance assessments. Additionally, we have launched new products features such as Secure Boot, which are being designed to provide additional integrity assurance of the firmware and software running on our hardware platform by establishing an encrypted key-based chain-of-trust relationship in the boot process. The manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 9001 standards. The manufacturing process and material supply chains are flexible enough to be moved to steer away from geopolitical conflicts that impact cost.
 We use a collaborative sales and operations planning forecast of expected demand based upon historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We update these forecasts monthly to determine our material requirements. Our manufacturing partners procure the components needed to build our products based on our demand forecasts. This allows us to leverage the purchasing power of our manufacturing partners. Our products rely on key components, including merchant silicon, integrated circuit components and power supplies purchased from a limited number of suppliers, including certain sole source providers. Lead times for materials and components vary significantly, and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, complexity, contract terms, demand and availability for a component at a given time. From time to time, we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple qualified sources or where our suppliers are geographically concentrated. We, like the rest of our industry, are currently experiencing such a shortage in semiconductors and other key components used for our hardware. These shortages continue to drive increased costs for components and shipping. In addition, labor shortages and facility closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to cause delays and increased logistics costs. We continue to source scarce components for significantly higher prices on the open market, which is impacting our gross margin and, disrupting production when such components are not available. We may also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints and enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supply. Our product development efforts also depend upon continued collaboration with our key suppliers, including our merchant silicon vendors such as Broadcom. As we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors, it is critical that we work in tandem with our key vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features.
 We believe our sourcing and manufacturing strategy allowed us to adjust quickly to changes in market demand, working with our ODM suppliers and developing direct relationships with key component suppliers to support the backlog generated through the unprecedented demand. We continue to focus on optimizing product availability through sourcing, rationalizing our supply chain, outsourcing or virtualizing certain activities, and consolidating distribution sites and service logistics partners. These efforts also include process optimization initiatives, such as vendor managed inventory, and other operational models and strategies designed to drive improved efficiencies in our sourcing, production, logistics and fulfillment.

Research and Development
 The success of our products to date is due in large part to our focus on research and development. We believe that continued success in the marketplace will depend on our ability to develop new and enhanced products employing leading-edge technology that provide business solutions affordably, securely and effortlessly. Accordingly, we are undertaking development efforts with an emphasis on increasing the reliability, usability and security while innovating our user and buyer experience reducing the overall network operating costs of customers.
 Our product development activities focus on solving the needs of customers in the enterprise campus edge and core by providing a unified wired, wireless, and SD-WAN cloud-driven network, enabling secure access from edge to public or private clouds in targeted verticals. Current activities include the continuing development of our innovative switching technology aimed to give our customers flexibility in how they deploy, connect to the cloud, and configure instantly saving time and money. Our ongoing research activities cover a broad range of areas, including cloud native technologies and solutions, wired and wireless networking, switching, and routing, network security, identity management, open standards interfaces, software defined networks, and data center fabrics. In addition, we continue to invest in ML/AI technology solutions targeting Cloud Wi-Fi, IoT anomaly detection, autonomous networking, and user recommendations.
 We continue to enhance the functionality of our network operating systems which have been designed to provide high reliability and availability. This allows us to leverage a common operating system across different hardware and network chipsets.
 As of June 30, 2022, our research and development organization consisted of 708 employees. Research and development efforts are conducted in several of our locations, including Morrisville, North Carolina; San Jose, California; Salem, New Hampshire; Toronto, Canada; Shannon, Ireland; Massy, France; Hangzhou, China; and Bangalore and Chennai, India. 
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. As of June 30, 2022, we had 744 issued patents in the United States and 472 patents outside of the United States. The expiration dates of our issued patents in the United States range from 2022 to 2040. Although we have patent applications pending, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. As of June 30, 2022, we had 24 registered trademarks in the United States and 217 registered trademarks outside of the United States.
 We enter into confidentiality, inventions assignment or license agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties with whom we do business, and control access to, and distribution of, our software, documentation and other proprietary information. In addition, we provide our software products to end-user customers primarily under “clickwrap” license agreements. These agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee, and thus these agreements may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.
 Competition
 The market for network switches, routers and software (including analytics) which is part of the broader market for networking equipment is extremely competitive and characterized by rapid technological progress, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. We believe the principal competitive factors in this market are:

• | expertise and familiarity with network protocols, network switching/routing/wireless and network management;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | robust, cloud-driven options that reduce the cost of acquisition, provisioning, and ongoing management of network management;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expertise and familiarity with application analytics software;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | expertise with network operations and management software;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | product performance, features, functionality and reliability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | price/performance characteristics;
--+-----------------------------------


• | timeliness of new product introductions;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | adoption of emerging industry standards;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | customer service and support;
--+------------------------------

• | size and scope of distribution network;
--+----------------------------------------


• | brand name;
--+------------


• | breadth of product offering;
--+-----------------------------


• | access to customers; and
--+-------------------------


• | size of installed customer base.
--+---------------------------------

 We believe we compete with our competitors with respect to many of the foregoing factors. However, the market for network switching solutions is dominated by a few large companies, particularly Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co., Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Arista Networks Inc., Juniper Networks Inc., and Ubiquiti Inc. Most of these competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, broader product lines and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources.
 We expect to face increased competition from both traditional networking solutions companies and cloud platform companies offering Infrastructure-as-a-Service (“IaaS”) and Platform-as-a-Service (“PaaS”) products to enterprise customers. In that regard, we expect to face increased competition from certain cloud computing companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google providing a cloud-based platform of data center compute and networking services for enterprise customers.
 We believe Extreme is uniquely positioned to address its overarching vision of the future, the Infinite Enterprise, with its bet on industry-leading cloud solutions, automation and AI. Although we believe that our solutions and strategy will improve our ability to meet the needs of our current and potential customers, we cannot guarantee future success.
 Restructuring and Impairment
 Fiscal year 2020
 During fiscal 2020, we reduced our operating expenses by exiting a floor of our San Jose, California facility and additional space in our Salem, New Hampshire facility. We continued our initiative to realign our operations resulting from the acquisition of Aerohive and consolidating our workforce and exited the facility we acquired from Aerohive in Milpitas, California.
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, with the global disruptions and slow-down in the demand of our products caused by the global pandemic outbreak of, COVID-19, and the uncertainty around the timing of the recovery of the market, we initiated a reduction-in-force plan (the “2020 Plan”) to reduce our operating costs and enhance financial flexibility. The plan affected approximately 320 employees primarily from the research and development and sales organizations who were located mainly in the United States and India. Costs associated with the 2020 Plan are primarily comprised of employee severance and benefits expenses.
 Fiscal year 2021
 Along with the reduction and realignment of the headcount under the 2020 Plan, we continued the process of relocating certain lab test equipment to third-party consulting companies during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. 
 Fiscal year 2022
 During fiscal year 2022, the Company completed the reduction and realignment of the headcount and relocation of lab test equipment under the 2020 Plan. 
 Environmental Matters
 We are subject to various environmental and other regulations governing product safety, materials usage, packaging and other environmental impacts in the United States and in various countries where our products are manufactured and sold. We are also subject to regulatory developments, including recent SEC disclosure regulations relating to so-called "conflict minerals," relating to ethically responsible sourcing of the components and materials used in our products. To date, compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
 We are committed to energy efficiency in our product lines. Accordingly, we believe this is an area that affords us a competitive advantage for our products in the marketplace. We maintain compliance with various regulations related to the environment, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment and the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment regulations adopted by the European Union. To date, our compliance efforts with various United States and foreign regulations related to the environment has not had a material effect on our operating results.

Human Capital 
 At Extreme, we manage our human capital guided by our core values of Candor, Transparency, Curiosity, Teamwork, Ownership, and Inclusion. We apply these principles to talent acquisition and management, compensation and benefits, and diversity and inclusion.
 As of June 30, 2022, we employed 2,643 people. Of these, 40.6% work in sales and marketing, 26.8% in research and development, 4.5% in operations, 17.3% in customer support and services and 10.9% in finance and administration. These employees were located worldwide, with 48.5% located in the United States, 7.1% in other locations in the Americas, 24.8% in the APAC region, which includes Asia Pacific, China, South Asia and Japan, and 19.6% in the EMEA region, which includes Europe, Russia, Middle East and Africa.
 None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In certain foreign jurisdictions, where required by local law or custom, some of our employees are represented by local workers’ councils and/or industry collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good, and we have not experienced any work stoppages due to labor disagreements.
 
Talent Acquisition and Management. We strive to attract and retain the most qualified employees for each role within the Company. To do this, we utilize various recruiting channels, including employee referrals and those targeting diverse candidates. We on-board new employees through the New Hire Academy and encourage skill development throughout the employee journey utilizing various role-specific training programs, career development tools, manager training, coaching, and mentorship.
Compensation and Benefits. Our compensation philosophy is to offer a competitive compensation package designed to reward achievement of the Company’s goals. Our short-term bonus plan is designed to motivate employees to meet half-year goals, and our employee stock purchase plan and grants of restricted stock units to eligible employees reward longer-term stock price appreciation. Our U.S. benefits plan includes health benefits, life and disability insurance, various voluntary insurances, flexible time off and leave programs, an employee assistance plan, an educational assistance policy, and a 401(k) plan with a competitive employer match. Our international benefits plans are competitive locally and generally provide similar benefits.
 Diversity and Inclusion. We believe that we gain valuable perspective that drives better decision making when we listen to diverse voices. To foster an inclusive environment, we support several employee resource groups (“ERGs”), including Women in Networking (the new name for our Women’s Council), Black @ Extreme (Black/African American), LaRaza (Latinx/Hispanic), Maitri (employees in India), Pride Alliance (LGBTQ+), Global Veterans Council, API (Asian Pacific Islanders), and APPs (Aspiring Professionals Program). We are stepping up to this challenge of fostering an inclusive environment through efforts to improve recruiting of diverse candidates, identify and support high potential employees, and retain diverse employees. Since we started our first ERG, Women in Networking, we have increased the number of women employees and our female leadership. We are striving to increase the number of African-American/Black employees and Latinx/Hispanic employees by the end of calendar year 2025, and to increase the number of women and underrepresented groups within our management teams.
