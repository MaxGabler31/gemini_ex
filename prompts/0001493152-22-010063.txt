On December 31, 2012, Global Tech and its new subsidiary, TTII Oil & Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation, signed a binding asset purchase agreement with American Resource Technologies, Inc. (“ARUR”), a Kansas corporation, to acquire all the assets of ARUR for a purchase price of $513,538, which was paid in the form of 4,668,530 shares of Global Tech’s common stock as described in the asset purchase agreement. The shares were valued at $0.11 per share, based on the closing trading price of the common stock on the Closing Date. The assets purchased from ARUR include a 75% working interest in oil and gas leases in Kansas, as well as other oil field assets, a natural gas pipeline, currently shut down that is also located in Kansas, 25% interest in three other business entities operating in Kansas, and accounts receivables from two companies operating in Brazil in the amounts of $3,600,000 and $3,600,000 respectively. TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. also purchased three promissory notes in the amounts of $100,000, $100,000 and $350,000, as well an overdue contract for revenue in the amount of $1,000,000. Finally, a gun sight patent was also acquired from Century Technologies, Inc. All accounts and notes receivable were deemed uncollectable due to the age and circumstances, and therefore were assessed no value in the asset purchase. The equity ownerships were also deemed to be impaired due to the inactive nature of the entities and were not allocated any value. The gun sight patent was also not readily assessable as to value and no purchase price was allocated to this asset. Also, due to the mechanic’s lien and lawsuit on the oil leases, as well as the absence of an official reserve report, the oil lease was also impaired, and no value was recorded for this asset. In September 2015, the Chautauqua County Court decided that American Resource Technologies Inc. management and Board of Directors improperly acted and rendered the original Agreement a nullity. During 2019, the Company removed additional obligations related to the ARUR acquisition and settled legal fees due. During the 2nd quarter 2020, the Company was successful in recalling the 4,668,530 shares and cancelling them from the shareholders list.

Currently, Global Tech and GoFun are litigating the matter in the U.S District Court for the Southern District of New York, Docket No.17-CV-03727. On October 2, 2019, the Company was able to secure, via preliminary settlement, the return of 43,649,491 shares of the Company’s stock out of the original 50,649,491 that were issued in good faith to GoFun in anticipation of a final stock exchange. That stock has been returned to the Company’s treasury and cancelled. On May 14, 2021, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division: Monmouth County (docket no. PAS-MON-C-60-21) issued an order restraining the removal of restrictive legends on the remaining 7,000,000 shares of stock, pending further order of the New Jersey court. The underlying matter currently in the U.S. district Court for the Southern District of New York, remains pending.
 
On December 30, 2019, a dispute between the Company and its counsel regarding the GoFun matter, above, resulted in a filing, and subsequent settlement, of an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of New York (Index No. 656396/2019). Pursuant to the settlement, counsel for the company accepted previously issued shares as full payment for all legal work, expenses, costs, and other fees.
