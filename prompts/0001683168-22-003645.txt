Market Strategy
 The business consulting service industry is highly competitive. The Company will utilize the past business experience and relationships developed by its sole officer and director to identify and pursue new consulting opportunities.
Number of Employees 
 Other than our sole officer, the Company currently has no full-time employees. We currently have people ready to fill positions as soon as they are needed in both office staff and work force roles.
Research and Development
 We have not incurred any research and development costs in the fiscal years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021.
 
Insurance
 We do not maintain insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have insurance, if we are made a party to any action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
Government Regulation
 We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to export and import of work wear and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction in which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. We do not need to receive any government approvals to conduct our business. However, we will have to comply with all applicable export and import regulations should we recommence our operations.
